"Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,",Amittai naupa Jona kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a:
"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.","“Tho la, Ninevi khuo, khawpui ropuitaka chun fe la, a chunga thu tlânginsampui rawh; an rîtlona chu ka hmaah a hung tlung ta sih a,” tiin."
"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, Jona chu LALPA hmaa inthawka Tarsis-a tlân hmang dingin a tho tah a; chun, Joppa khuoah a zuk feh a, Tarsis khaw pan ding lawng a hmuh a, chuongchun, a chuong man ding chu a pêk a, LALPA hmaa inthawk chun Tarsis pan dinghai le fe dingin lawnga chun a lût thla ve tah a."
"But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun thli natak el tuisuorieta chun ân hrângtir a, tuisuorieta chun thlipui nasatak el chu a hrâng tah a; chuongchun, lawng chu kawi ding ang elin a um tah a."
"Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.","Chun, lawng mihai chun an ṭih a, mâni pathien an ko seng a; lawng chu an ta dinga a zângna dingin lawng sûnga thuomhnawhai chu tuisuorieta chun an pei suok tah a, Jona ruok chu lawng sûngril taka chun a lo lût tah a, a lo zâl a, a lo ininnghil dêr tah a."
"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.","Chuongchun, lawng hotu chu a kuoma chun a hung a, “Aw nang a inpa, iengtizie am a na? Tho la, i Pathien ko rawh, Pathien chun, ei bohmang nawna dingin a mi ngaituo rawi mawh,” a ta."
"And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.","Chun, “Hung ta u, hi thil ṭha naw ei chunga hung tlung hi tu lei am a na ti ei hriet theina dingin, ai sân ei tiu,” tiin an inbiek tâwl a. Chuongchun, ai chu an sân a, aisân chu Jona chunga chun a tlu tah a."
"Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?","Chun, a kuoma chun, “Hi thil ṭha naw ei chunga um hi tu lei am a nih mi hril rawh, kan ngên che hi? I sinthaw ieng am a na? Khâwlaia inthawka hung am i nih a? Khâw tieng ram mi am i na, khâwlai ieng hnam am i na?” an tih a."
"And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hebrai mi ka na, tuisuoriet le khawmuol siemtu LALPA, vân Pathien chu ka ṭi a nih,” a ta."
"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.","Chun, mihai chun an ṭi nasa ta êm êm a, a kuoma chun, “Sei le, ieng am i lo thaw an leh?” an tih a; a hril ta lei chun mihai chun LALPA hmaa inthawkin a tlân hmang a nih ti an hriet tah a."
"Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.","Chuongchun, a kuoma chun, “Ei ta dinga tuisuoriet hi a fâwn nawna dingin i chungah ieng am kan thaw ding?” an tih a, tuisuoriet chu a fâwn nasa deu deu el sih a."
"And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Mi pawm kâng unla tuisuorieta hin mi the lût el ro; chuongchun, tuisuoriet hi in ta dingin fâwn ta naw ni hai; keima leiin hi thlipui nasatak el hi in chungah a hrâng a nih ti ka hriet sih a,” a ta."
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.,"Nisienlakhawm, mihai chun khawmuola kîr dingin an kar rak rak a, amiruokchu, an thei nawh a, tuisuoriet hlak chu an chungah a fâwn nasa deu deu el sih a."
"Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.","Chuleichun, LALPA chu an ko a, “Aw LALPA, hi mipa hringna lei hin mi sukbohmang naw la, mithiem thisen maw chu kan chunga innghat lul lo dingin kan ngên che, Aw LALPA, kan ngên che, nangin i nuom anga i thaw a ni sih a,” an tih a."
"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.","Chuongchun, Jona chu an pawm kâng a, tuisuorieta chun an the lût tah a; chun, tuisuoriet chu a fâwn so bur bur chu a re tah a."
"Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.","Chuongchun, mihai chun LALPA chu nasatakin an ṭi tah a; LALPA kuoma chun inthawina an inhlân a, thu dâm an tiem tah a."
And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.,"Chun, LALPA chun Jona lem dingin nga lientak a lo ruot tah a; chu nga sûnga chun Jona chu ni thum le zân thum a um a."
Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish’s belly.,"Chun, Jona chu nga phîng sûnga inthawk chun LALPA a Pathien kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai a."
"And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, And thou heardest my voice.","Hieng ang hin a tih a: “Ka rinumna leiin LALPA chu ka ko a, Ama chun a mi lo dawn a; Seol phîng sûnga inthawk chun ka ko a, Nangin ka râwl chu i hriet a."
"For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.","Inthûktakah tuisuoriet sûngrila chun nang chun i mi peilût a, Tui tamtak chu ka vêlin a um a; I tuifâwnhai le i tui insawkhai po po chun a mi vur pei a."
"And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.","Chun, ‘I mithmua inthawka pei suok ka na, Nisienlakhawm, i biekin inthieng tieng ngha nâwk ka tih,’ ka ta."
"The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.","Tuihai chun ka hringna chenin an mîn huol vêl a, Tui inthûk chu ka vêlin a um a; Hlohnahai chun ka lu a tuom vêl a nih."
"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.","Tlâng bul tâwp rêthaia chun ka zu feh a, Hnuoi chun kumkhaw ta dingin a kalnahai chun a mi khâr khum a; Amiruokchu, nangin aw LALPA ka Pathien, khursûnga inthawk chun ka hringna chu i lâk suok a nih."
"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.","Ka hringna chu ka sûnga a chau lai chun, LALPA chu ka hriet zing a; Ka ṭawngṭaina chu i biekin inthienga chun i kuomah a hung tlung a nih."
They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.,"Thil teplo khêl thu mei mei ngaituotuhai chun, An ta dinga ngilneina chu an nghatsan a nih."
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.,"Kei ruok chun lâwmthu hrilna râwl leh i kuomah inthâwina inhlân ka ta; Thu ka tiem ta chu hlen ka ta, Sandamna chu LALPA ta a nih,” tiin."
"And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.","Chun, LALPA chun nga chu a biek a, Jona chu khawmuolah a luok suok tah a."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jona kuoma chun a hung tlung nawn nâwk a:"
"Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.","“Tho la, Ninevi khuo, khaw ropuitaka chun fe la, thu hril ding ka tuk che hi va tlânginsampui rawh,” tiin."
"So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.","Chuongchun, Jona chu a tho a, LALPA thu ang chun Ninevi khuoa chun a fe tah a. Ninevi khuo chu khawpui ropuitak el, ni thum lam tling a nih."
"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.","Jona chu ni khat lam chen khaw- puia chun a hang lût ṭan phawt a, “Tuta inthawka ni sâwmliah Ninevi hi sukbohmang a ni ding a nih,” tiin a khêk tah a."
"And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.","Ninevi mihai chun Pathien an ring tah a; bunghei ding tiin an puong a, anni laia a lien taka inthawka a chîn tak chenin saiip puon an sil tah a."
"And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.","Chuong thu chu Ninevi khaw laltak nahrietah a hung tlung tah a, a lalṭhungphaa inthawk chun a tho a, a lal puon chu a hlîp thlâk a, saiip puon a sil a, vut lai a ṭhung tah a."
"And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;","Laltak le a mi lienhai thupêkin laltak chun Ninevi khaw sûnga chun thu a puongin ân suo tah a, “Mihriem amanih, ran amanih, bâwng ruol amanih, berâm ruol amani khawm chun iengkhawm intem naw raw se; fain tui khawm dâwn naw raw se;"
"but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.","mihriem le ranhai chun saiip puon sil lem hai sienla, nasatakin Pathien ko raw hai se, anih, mi tinin mâni lampui ṭha naw le, an kuta inpâwngnêkna chu nghatsan raw hai se."
"Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?","Ei bohmang nawna dingin, Pathien chu kîrin, lungril inlêtin, a lunginsenna nasataka inthawk chun inlêt naw ni ti tuin am a hriet a?” tiin."
"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.","Chuongchun, Pathienin an thilthawhai chu enin, an lampui ṭha naw chu an nghatsan ti a hmu a, an kuoma a hril tah thaw a tum thil ṭha naw chu, Pathien chun ân lêt a; a thaw ta nawh a."
"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.","Amiruokchu, chu thil chun Jona chu a suklungni ta naw êm êm a, a lunginsen a,"
"And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil.","LALPA kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai a, “Aw LALPA, ka ngên che, hi hi ni lo am a ni kan rama ka um laia ka hril kha? Hi lei hin Tarsis tieng khan ka tlân hmang a ni kha, nang chu lunginsietna hau, thil ṭha nawa inthawka inlêt nâwk hlak i ni ti ka hriet a."
"Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.","Chuleichun, Aw LALPA, tuhin ka hringna hi mi lâkpêk el dingin ka ngên che; keia ta ding chun dam nêkin thi a ṭha lem sih a,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?","LALPA chun, “I lunginsen hi i thaw dik am a ni ding chu?” a ta."
"Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.","Chuongchun, Jona chu khawpuia inthawk chun a fe suok a, khawpui saktieng panga chun a ṭhung a, chutaka chun sâwlbûk a bâwl a, khawpui chunga thil hung tlung ding chu hmu tumin a hnuoi inhlima chun a ṭhung ta zing a."
"And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun ûm a lo ruot a, chu chu Jona chunga chun ân zâmtir a, a rinumnaa inthawka sansuok dinga a lu zâr hlietu dingin. Chuongchun, Jona chu ûm lei chun nasatakin a lâwm tah a."
"But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.","Amiruokchu, Pathienin a zînga chun khawfingchat laiin, thilnge a ruot a, chu chun ûm chu a rêt a, a hung vuoi tah a."
"And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.","Chun, nisa a hung suok chun Pathienin khawsak thli lum a ruot a; nisa chun Jona lu chu a em a, a thidang a, a ta ding chun thi a hni tah a; “Keia ta dingin dam nêkin thi a ṭha lem,” a ti tah a."
"And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.","Pathien chun Jona kuomah, “Ûm chungchâng thua I lunginsen hi i thaw dik am a nih?” a ta. Ama chun, “Thi pha khawp hiela ka lunginsen hi ka thaw dik a nih,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:","LALPA chun, “I în rimpui lo, I în ṭhangtir khawm ni lo, zân khat thila hung uma, zân khat thila bohmang nâwk ûm hi i lainat a;"
"and should not I have regard for Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?","Ninevi khuo, khaw ropuitak, a sûngah mi nuoi khat le sîng hni nêka tam, an changtieng le vawitieng khawm thlier thei lohai le ran ruol tamtak umna hi, ka lunginsiet naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
