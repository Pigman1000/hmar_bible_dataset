"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and the Saviour Jesus Christ:","Simon Peter, Isu Krista suok le tirko chun: Isu Krista kan Pathien le Sandamtu felna leia ringna hlutak kan chang ang chang vehai kuomah:"
Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;,Pathien le ei Lalpa Isu hrietnaa chun in chungah lunginsietna le inremna sukpungin um raw se.
"seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue;","Ama ropuina le ṭhatna zâra a mi kotu, a chanchin hriet leiin a Pathien thilthawtheinain hringna le Pathien ngaisakna kawnga chun thil po po a mi pêk sih a."
"whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.","Chuong zâra chun a thutiem hlutak le ropui nasatakhai chu a mi pêk a nih, chuongchun, châkna leia khawvêla sietna hung um hi tlân suok sanin, chuong thutiem hlutak le ropui nasatakhai lei chun Pathien nungchang inṭâwmpui ve thei in tih."
"Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge;","Anih, chu chu lei tak chun taimâk hrim hrim insuoin, in ringnaa chun ṭhatna inṭhangtir unla, in ṭhatnaa chun hrietna,"
and in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control patience; and in your patience godliness;,"in hrietnaa chun insûmna, in insûmnaa chun selna, in selnaa chun Pathien ngaisakna,"
and in your godliness brotherly kindness; and in your brotherly kindness love.,"in Pathien ngaisaknaa chun unau- hai hmangaina, in unauhai hmangai- naa chun hmangaina inṭhangtir ro."
"For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Chuong chu in ta a na, a pung pei si chun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista hrietna kawnga hin zawmthaw lo le ra nuom takin a siem cheu a nih."
"For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.","Tûkhawm chuong thil nei naw chu mitdel a na, hnaitaka mi chau a hmu thei a, hi hmaa a suolhai sâwpfai pêkna chu a theinghil ta sih a."
"Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:","Chuleiin, unauhai, a kona le a thlangna cheu chu sukdet dingin taimâk insuo nâwkzuol ro; chuong chu in thaw chun ieng tik khawm tlu naw ti niu;"
for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.,"chuongchun, Isu Krista ei Lalpa le Sandamtu chatuon rama lûtna chu nasataka inhmutir nîng in tih."
"Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with you.","Chuleiin, chuong thil chu hrein, thutak in kuoma uma chun in det dea chu chuong thil chu inhrietthartir cheu ka tum zing hlak a."
"And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;","Chun, hi bâwktêa ka um sûng po hin nangni hrietpuiin chawkhar rawp cheu ṭhain ka hriet a nih,"
"knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.",ei Lalpa Isu Kristain a min hriettir ang khan ka bâwktê sie hmang hun chu tlung vak a tih ti ka hriet a.
"Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.","Anih, ka fe suok hnunga chuong thil chu in hriet zing rawp theina dingin thâwng ka tih."
"For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista thil- thawthei zie le a hung nâwkna thu chu kan inhriettir lai cheu khan, tienami vartaka ngaituo suok elhai zâwm kan ni nawh a, a ropuina hmutuhai kan ni lem in sâwnnaw."
"For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:","Ama chun Pa Pathien kuoma inthawkin chawimawina le ropuina a hmuh a, chu lai chun ropuina nasataka inthawk chun hieng ang râwl hi a kuomah a hung tlung a, “Hi hi ka Naupa dittak, ka ilâwm bêk bêk a nih,” tiin."
"and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.","Chun, tlâng inthienga kan um laiin chu râwl chu vâna inthawka hung suok keini ngeiin kan hriet a nih."
"And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:","Chun, hrillâwkna thu det nâwkzuol chu kan nei a nih, khuo a hung var a, sikhawvar chu in lungrila a hung suok hmakhat, hmun inthima khâwnvar var ngaisak anga in ngaisak chun thaw ṭhang in tih."
"knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.",Pathien Lekha Thu hrillâwk hrim hrim hi mâniin hrilfie ding a ni nawh ti hre hmasa phawt unla.
"For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.","Thu hrillâwk hrim hrim hi mihriem thua suok a ni ngai si nawh a, mihaiin Thlarau Inthieng tirin, Pathien kuoma inthawkin an hril lem hlak a nih."
"But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.","Nisienlakhawm, mihai lai chun zâwlnei tehlêmhai khawm an hung suok kha, chuong ang bawkin nangni lai khawm inchûktirtu tehlêmhai la hung um an tih, anni chun anni inchawtu Lalpa meu chu inphatsanin, mi sukse thei ringna tumhai inrûkin la hung lûtpui an ta, mâni chungah kârloa bohmangna intlungtir an tih."
And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.,"Chun, mi tamtakin an hurna tieng thilhai chu chîng vêng an ta, anni leiin lampui indik tak chu hrilsiet ning a tih."
"And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.","Chun, sum inhnar leiin thu khêlin sumdâwngna dingin hmang an ti cheu a; nisienlakhawm, inhmaa an thiemnaw changna chu a nêp chuong nawh a, an bohmangna hlak a ininnghil bawk nawh."
"For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;","Vântirkohaiin thil an suksuol lai khan Pathienin a hla nawh a, hremhmunah a pei a, rorêlpêk dinga khêk dingin khur inthimah a khum lem sih a."
"and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;","Chun, ama ngaisaknawhai um- na, khawvêla khan tui suklêtin, tien- lai khawvêl chu a hla nawh a, nisienlakhawm, Noa, felna thu hril- tu, mi dang pasari leh a sandam tah a."
"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;","Sodom le Gomorra khuohai chu ama ngaisak naw la hung um dinghai inentirna dingin a hmang a, vuta inchangtirin, sukbohmangin thiem- naw ân changtir tah a."
"and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked","Lota mi fel, mi suolhai umdân hurtak leia lungngai bêk bêk chu a sandam tah a;"
"(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds):","(chu mi fel chu anni laia a umin a mitin a hmuh a, a nain a hriet a, dân naw anga an thilthawhai chun a lungril fel chu ni tin an sukna bêk bêk hlak sih a.)"
"the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment;","Lalpa chun, ama ngaisaktuhai chu thlêmnaa inthawka sansuok dân le, fel nawhai chu rorêl nia dingin hrem puma khêk dân a hriet;"
"but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:","châkna inthieng naw kawnga tisa anga um le, rorêlpêkna hmusit- tuhai lem lem chu rorêl nia dingin hrem puma khêk dân a hriet nâwk zuol a nih. Invêthuoi le kâwmaw an na, ropuinahai an hrilsiet khawmin an inthin ngai nawh."
"whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.","Vântirko, hrâtna le thilthaw- theina nei lemhai hmanin, Lalpa hmaa chu an chungthu rêlpêkin an hrilsiet ngai naw kha."
"But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,","Nisienlakhawm, hieng thil- hring, ngaituona nei naw, mana sukbohmang dinga sa chaua pienghai ang hin, thil an hriet nawhai chu hrilsein; anni sietnain se ngei an tih."
"suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; men that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you;","Thil suksuol manin thilsuol tuor an tih. Sûna ruoiṭhe buoi in- hawiti mi an nih. In kuoma ruoi an ṭhein, anni inhlêmna ruoi ṭhe an ni leiin, inthieng nawna kaihai le thil khawhlohai an na;"
"having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;","mit uirea sip, suol bân thei naw- hai an nei a; mi det nawhai an thlêm thlûk a; inhnar hmang lungril an put a; ṭawngsephur nauhai an nih."
"forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;","Bosar naupa Balaam, thil suk- suol hlaw ngainatu lampui chu an hraw leiin lampui indik chu an mâksan a, an invâk hmang tah a."
but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.,"Nisienlakhawm, ama chu a bawsietna leiin kâwkin a um tah a; Sabengtung ṭawng thei naw chu mihriem ṭawngin a hung ṭawng a, zâwlnei invêtna chu a khap a nih."
"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.","Chuong chu tuikhur tui um naw le, sûm thlipui imût lêng chu an nih, chuonghai ta ding chun inthim sa khup chu khêk a ni tah."
"For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;","Thu teplo uortak taka hrilin, suola umhai laia inthawka tlân suok zinghai chu tisa châknaa hurnain an thlêm thlûk hlak sih a."
"promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.",Anni chu sietna suok ni pum zingin mihai chu zalênna thu an tiem hlak a; mi chu ama hnetu taphawt suokah a um hlak sih a.
"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.","Lalpa le Sandamtu Isu Krista an hriet leia khawvêl inthieng nawnahai an tlân suok san hnungin chutaka bawk chun an intâng nâwk a, ngama an um nâwk si chun, an umze nuhnung chu a tîra nêk chun a hung se ta lem nîng a tih."
"For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.","Lampui fel chu hriet hnunga, thupêk inthieng an kuoma inkawltira um chu nghatsan nêk chun, lampui fel hre naw hai sienla, an ta dingin a ṭha lem ding bah."
"It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.","“Ui ama luok tieng a kîr nâwk a, vawkpui insilfai ta khawm chirhakah insil dingin a kîr nâwk a,” ti thuvartawi indiktak ang thu chu an chungah a hung um ta a nih."
"This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance;","Dittakhai, tuta in kuoma ka ziek hi ka lekhathawn pahnina a na, chuonga chun, inhrietthartir ding cheuin, in lungril inthieng ka chawk- har ve ve a,"
"that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles:","zâwlnei inthienghai thu hrillâwk le, in tirkohai baua Lalpa le San- damtu thupêk chu in hriet zingna dingin."
"knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,","Hi hi hre hmasa unla, ni nu- hnungahai chun nuisantuhai chu, anni châkna anga umin, nuisan pumin hung an ta,"
"and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.","“A hung nâwkna ding thutiem chu khâwlai am a um a? Siem tîra inthawkin iengkim a um pângngai angin chi thlatuhai ininnghil nia inthawk ta kha a la um pei annâwm,” la tîng an tih."
"For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God;","Hieng hi an theinghil tehlêm hlak si; Pathien thuin tienlaiin vânhai a hung um a, hnuoi khawm tuia inthawka siemin tui laia hai chun a lo um a;"
"by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:","chu tuihai vêk chun chu laia khawvêl um chu a chîm a, a bohmang tah a, ti hi;"
"but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.","nisienlakhawm, tuta vânhai le hnuoi umhai hi chu thu bawk lei chun Pathien ngaisak naw mihai rorêl le bohmang nia dingin khêkin, meia dinga inkhâwl khâwm a ni tah."
"But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.","Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, hi thu bau khat hi theinghil naw ro, Lalpa ngai chun ni khat hi kum sâng khat ang a na, kum sâng khat khawm hi ni khat ang a nih, ti hi."
"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.","Mi ṭhenkhatin muonga an ruot angin, Lalpa chu a thutiem kawnga chu a muong nawh; tukhawm bo- hmang loa mi po po sim ditpuiin, nangni tiengah a dâwthei a ni lem."
"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpa ni chu inru angin hung tlung ngei a tih; chu nia chun vânhai chu nasataka inriin bohmang a ta, thil bulhai chu meia emhmangin um tâng a ta, hnuoi le a sûnga sinthaw umhai hi kâng hmang a tih."
"Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness,",Chuong thilhai chu chuong anga bohmang vawng ding a nih ti in hriet leiin um dân inthieng le Pathien ngaisak kawnga chun mi ieng ang am in ni ding a na?
"looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?","Pathien Ni hung tlung ding hun chu ṭhahnemngaitakin beisei zing ro. Chu ni chu a tlung chun vânhai chu kângin bohmang a ta, thil bulhai khawm chu meia emtuiin um tâng an tih."
"But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.","Nisienlakhawm, a thutiem ang chun vân tharhai le hnuoi thar, a sûnga felna umhai chu ei beisei a nih."
"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.","Chuleiin, dittakhai, chuong ang thilhai chu in beisei leiin, in- thiengnawna kai lo le sawisêl boin thlamuongtaka in um a hmu theina ding cheuin, taimâk insuo ro."
"And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;","Chun, ei Lalpa dawtheizie chu sandamnaa ruot ro; ei unaupa dittak Paula khawmin, a kuoma varna pêk ang peia in kuoma a ziek ang khan."
"as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.","A lekhathawn po poa chun chuong thu chu hrilin, chuong ang bawkin a ziek a nih; chuonga chun thu hriet intak takhai a um a, chuong chu mi var naw le mi det nawhaiin, Pathien Lekha Thu dang an ngai kawi angin an ngai kawi a, mâni le mâni an insukbohmang pha hlak a nih."
"Ye therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness.","Chuongchun, dittakhai, nang- nîn chuong thu chu in lo hriet lâwk leiin fîmkhur ro, chuong naw chun, mi suolhai indik nawnaa ṭhuoi hmanga umin, in det ṭhat lai tlu rawi in tih."
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and for ever. Amen.,"Amiruokchu, ei Lalpa le San- damtu Isu Krista lunginsietna le hrietnaa chun inṭhang lien ro. Tuta le chatuon chenin ama kuoma chun ropuina um raw se. Amen."
