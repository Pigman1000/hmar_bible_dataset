"The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.","Upa chun: Dittak Gaia, titakzeta ka ihmangai kuoma chun,"
"Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.","Dittak, i thlarau chun malsÃ¢wm- na a hmu angin, iengkima malsÃ¢wm- na i hmu le i dam theina dingin ka á¹­awngá¹­ai hlak a nih."
"For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.","Unauhai hungin, i takzie, (thu- taka i um hlakzie) an mi hung inhriettir lai khan, ka lÃ¢wm bÃªk bÃªk sih a."
"Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.",Ka nauhai thutakah an um ti ka hriet nÃªka lÃ¢wmna nasa lem hrim ka nei nawh.
"Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;","Dittak, unauhai mikhuol ni sien- lakhawm, an chunga i thaw ta- phawtah ringumtakin i thaw hlak a;"
who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:,"chuongchun, kohranhai hmaah i hmangaina an inhriettir tah; anni an inzinnaah Pathien mi ni Ã¢wm hrima i á¹­hangpui chun á¹­hÃ¢ng a tih;"
"because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.",a Hming lei chun Jentailhai kuoma inthawkin iengkhawm la loin an suok sih a.
"We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.","Chuongchun, thutak thawpuitu- hai ei ni theina dingin chuong ang mi chu eini chun ei lÃ¢wm ding a nih."
"I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.","Kohranhai kuoma khan thu tlÃ¢wmtÃª chu ka ziek tah; nisienla- khawm, Diotrepha, anni laia chung- hnung nuom hlak khan, a mi lÃ¢wm si nawh."
"Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church.","Chuleiin, ka hung chun chu a thilthawhai inhriet suoktir nÃ¢wk ka tih, kan chungthu suol hrilin a bautamzie hi; chu khawm chu hun a ti nawh a, ama ngeiin unauhai a lÃ¢wm nawh a, a lÃ¢wm nuomhai khawm a khap a, kohrana inthawkin a hnawt dawk hlak."
"Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.","Dittak, suol chu inchÃ»k naw la, á¹­hat chu inchÃ»k lem rawh. Thil á¹­ha thawtu chu Pathiena inthawk a na, thil suol thawtu chun Pathien a hmu ngai nawh."
"Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true.","Demetri chun mi po po inpÃ¢k a hlaw a, thutaka inpÃ¢k ngei a hlaw bawk a; anih, keini khawmin kan inpÃ¢k a nih; kan inpÃ¢kna hi Ã¢n dik a nih ti i hriet."
"I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen:","I kuomah thu tamtak ziek ding ka nei a, nisienlakhawm, lekhatui le lekhazieknain i kuoma ziek ka nuom nawh a;"
"but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.","sÃ¢wtnawtÃª hnunga hmu che ka beisei lem a, chuongchun, inhma- tuoin inbieng ei tih. Thlamuongna i chungah um raw se. Ei ruolhaiin chibai an bÃ»k che. An hming lam sengin ruolhai chu chibai mi bÃ»k pÃªk rawh."
