"For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which ye show toward all the saints,","Chuleiin, kei khawma Lalpa Isu ringna nangnia um le, mi inthienghai po po chunga in inlangtir hlak hmangaina chu, ka lo hrietin,"

"and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might","ama kona beiseina dâm, mi inthienghaia chun a ro hluo ding ropui hauzie dâm, a thahrui hrâtna thaw zie ang peia, keini a ringtuhai tienga a thilthawtheina inkhi ruolloa lien Krista chunga a thaw —"
"which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,","chu chu Krista ah asuk lang a ,mithi laia inthawka a keitho a vanram ah a kut changtienga a an thrungtir khan,"
"far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:","inlalna dâm, thuneina dâm, thilthawtheina dâm, rorêlna po po dâm, hi khawvêla chau ni loa, khaw- vêl la hung tlung ding hai le hming sak tinrênghai chunga hai"

"which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.","kohran chu a taksa a nih, iengkim tinrênga suksiptu famkimna chu."
"And you did he make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,","Nangni khawm in bawsiet le in suolhai leia thi in ni lai khan, a sukhring cheu a nih,"
"wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;","chuongahai chun inhma khan hi khawvêl dân angin in um kha, boruoka thuneina lal, tuta awinaw nauhai sûnga sin thaw zingtu thlarau dân ang hin."
"among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:—","Chuong ringnaw nauhai laia chun, eini khawm inhma chun tisa le lungril nuomzâwng thawin, ei tisa châknahai angin ei um vawng a, mi danghai angin lunginsenna naua insieng hrim ei ni kha."
"but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun lunginsietna a hauin, a mi hmangai- na nasatak lei khan,"
"even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),","ei bawsietna leia thi ei ni lai meu khawmin, Krista ruolin a mi suk- hring veh a, (lunginsietnaa sandam in ni tah),"
"and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus:","Krista Isua chun ama ruol bawka mi keithoin, vân hmunhaiah ama kuom ngeiah a mîn ṭhungtir tah a,"
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:,"Chuongchun, hun la hung tlung dinghaia chun Krista Isua hin ei chunga ngilneiin, a lunginsietna nasatzie chu inentir thei a tih."
"for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;","Ringna leia lunginsietnaa sandam in ni sih a, chu khawm chu nangnia inthawka suok a ni nawh a, Pathien thilpêk a nih."
"not of works, that no man should glory.","Thilthaw lei a ni nawh; chuong naw chun, miin suong rawi an tih."
"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.","Thil ṭha thaw dinga Isu Kristaa chun siema umin, ama kut suok ei ni sih a, chu thil ṭha thaw chu ei umna dingin Pathienin a buotsai lâwk a nih."
"Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;","Chuleiin, hi hi hre zing ro: Inhmaa nangni tisaa Jentail, tisaa kuta siem “Sertan” an tihaiin, “Sertannaw,” an tihai,"
"that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.","khâng lai khan Krista boin, Israel khuoletui leh intuolkhat loin, khawvêla hin beiseina hrim nei lo le, Pathien boa umin, tiemna thu- thlunghaia mikhuola in um kha."
But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.,"Tu ruok hin chu Krista Isuah, nangni inhmaa hlataka umhai kha, Krista thisen chun sukhnaiin in lo um tah a."
"For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,","Ama chu ei inremna a nih, pâwl hnihai chu pumkhata siemin, an inkâr ping dangna bang chu a sukchim a;"
"having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace;","ama chun intaina, (ser le sâng thilhaia thupêk Dân um chu), a taksaa sukboin, amaa chun pahnihai chu mihriem thar pumkhata siem a, inremna a siem theina ding le,"
"and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:",kraws zâra taksa pumkhata pahnihai chu Pathien le ân remtir theina dingin: chu kraws chun intaina chu a sukhlum sih a.
"and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:","Chun, a hungin nangni hlataka umhai kuomah inremna Chanchin Ṭha a hril cheu a, hnaitaka umhai kuoma khawm Chanchin Ṭha a hril bawk a."
for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.,"Ama zârin Thlarau hmunkhata, Pa kuoma lût theina ei nei ve ve a nih."
"So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,","Chuongchun, tuhin mikhuol le mi châm el in ni ta nawh a, mi inthienghai le chun tuol khat le Pathien sûnghai in ni ta lem a nih."
"being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;","Isu Krista ngei chu a kia lung pawimawtak niin, tirkohai le zâwlneihai lungphûm chunga bâwl in nih."
"in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;","Amaa chun lung rem tum senghai, inremtaka inchuktuokin, Lalpaa chun biekin inthiengah ân chang pei hlak a,"
in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.,"nangni khawm amaa chun, Thlaraua Pathien umna dinga rem khâwm in nih."
"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,—","Chuleichun, kei Paula, nangni Jentailhai leia Krista Isu mi intâng hin."
if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;,Nangni tienga Pathien lungin- sietna enkawlna sin a mi pêk kha lo hre ta ngei in ta;
"how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,","khânga thurûk chu inhriettirnaa inhriettira ka um kha, inhmaa tawitea ka ziek ang thu kha."
"whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;","Kha lei khan in tiemin, Krista thurûk ka hriet zie hi hre thei in tih."
"which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;","Chu chu tulaia a tirko inthieng- hai le zâwlnei inthienghai kuoma Thlarau inhriettirin a um ta ang hin, tuta hma tieng khan mihriem nauhai kuoma inhriettirin a um ngai nawh."
"to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,","Chu chu hi hi a nih: Chanchin Ṭha leiin, Krista Isua chun Jentailhai hi rohluopuihai, taksa pêngpuihai, thutiem dawngpuihai an ni hi."
"whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.","A thilthawtheina thaw zie anga, a thlâwna a pêk, Pathien lungin- sietna chu a mi pêk ang peia, chu Chanchin Ṭha rawngbâwltua siem ka nih."
"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;","Kei mi inthieng po po laia chîntak nêka chîn lem kuoma hin chu lunginsietna chu pêk a nih: Krista hausakzie suisuok ruollohai chan- chin chu Jentailhai kuoma hril ding le,"
and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;,thurûk chatuona inthawka Pathien iengkim siemtua inthupa um enkawlna chu ieng am a ni ti mi po po inhriettir dingin.
"to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,","Chuongchun, tulaia vân hmun- haia khin inlalna le thuneinahai kuoma chun, Pathien varna tinrêng kohranhai leiin inhriettirin um thei a tih;"
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:,"ei Lalpa Isua thaw a itum, a chatuon remruot ang pei chun."
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.,"Chun, Krista Isu ei ring leiin amaa vêk chun nêlna le ngamtaka lût theina ei nei."
"Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.","Chuongchun, nangni leia rinum ka tuornahai lei hin beidawng lo dingin ka ngên cheu; chuonghai chu in ropuina a nih."
"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,",Hi lei hin Pa hmaa chun ka dingṭhaṭhuon hlak:
"from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,",Pa hnuoi le vâna sûngkuo tinrêng hming chawina chu
"that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;","A ropuina hauzie ang peiin, a Thlarau zârah mihriem sûngril tienga chun thilthawtheinaa suk- hrâta ân umtir theina ding cheu le,"
"that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,","Krista chu ringna leia in lungril sûnga a chêng theina dingin; chuongchun, hmangainaa zung kei le, innghatna neia umin,"
"may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,","mi inthieng po pohai le chun, a lienzie dâm, a seizie dâm, ân thûkzie dâm, ân sângzie dâm hriet chieng theina le,"
"and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.","Krista hmangaina hriet phâk lo hriet theina nei a, Pathien famkimna tinrênga suksipa in um theina dingin."
"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,","Chuongchun, einia thaw hlak thilthawtheina ang peiin, ei hni le ei ngaituo po po nêka nasa lema thaw theitu kuoma ngei chun,"
unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.,"chatuonin, suon po po chenin kohrana le Krista Isua chun ropuina um raw se. Amen."
"I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,","Chuongchun, kei Lalpaa mi intâng hin ka ngên cheu–a kona cheu chu phua um dingin,"
"with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;","inngaitlâwmna le thuhnuoirawl- na po po neia, hmangainaa indâwtuo puma dâwtheina neia,"
giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.,inremna khuopnaa chun Thlarau inpumkhatna chu vawng dinga thaw dingin.
"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;","A ko san cheu beiseina hmun- khata ko in ni ang bawk khan, taksa pakhat le Thlarau pakhat chau a um a."
"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,","Lalpa pakhat, ringna hmunkhat, baptisma hmunkhat,"
"one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.","iengkim Pathien le Pa pakhat chau chu iengkim chungah a um a, iengkim fangsuokin a um a, iengkim sûngah a um bawk a nih."
But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.,"Nisienlakhawm, a thlâwna Kris- ta thilpêk inkhina ang peiin lungin- sietna chu ei kuom sengah pêk a nih."
"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.","Chuleichun, “Chung tienga a hang fe lai khan, Sal intânghai chu a ṭhuoi a; Mihriemhai kuoma khawm, Thilpêkhai a pêk a,” a ti chu."
"(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?","(Chuongchun, “A hang fe,” ti hi, hnuoi hmun inhnuoitakahai a hung ṭum zet naw chun iengtin am ning a ta?"
"He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)","A hung ṭum kha, iengkim a suksip theina dinga, vân po po chung daia hang fe bawk kha a nih)."
"And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;","Chuongchun, ṭhenkhathai chu tirko ni ding dâmin, ṭhenkhathai chu zâwlnei ni ding dâmin, ṭhenkhathai chu Chanchin Ṭha hriltu ni ding dâm- in, ṭhenkhathai chu kohran châwmtu le inchûktirtuhai ni ding dâmin a pêk a:"
"for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ:","Krista taksa siem ṭha dinga, rawngbâwlna sin thawa, mi inthieng- hai sukfamkim dinga,"
"till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:","ringna le Pathien Naupa hrietna kawnga chun thukhat vuoa puitlinga, Krista famkimna lienzie tluka ei rênga ei hung um theina dingin."
"that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;","Chuongchun, indiknawna zâwr- na angin, var vervêka mihriem hlêm fâwmin, inchûktirna thli tinrênga khing tieng khing tienga vawr le lên lên naupang ni ta nâwm ei nih a,"
"but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, even Christ;","hmangaia thu diktak hrilin, iengkimah amaah inṭhang lien thei lem ei tih; ama chu Lu a na, Krista chu."
"from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.","Ama zârah taksa pumpui chun inzawmna tinrêng thaw leia inrem- taka insuktuo le inzawm khâwmin, pêng tin sin thaw zie ang sengin, hmangainaa insiem ṭha dingin taksa chu a hung sukpung hlak a nih."
"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,","Chuongchun, hi hi ka hrilin Lalpaa chun kân hriettir cheu a nih: Jentailhai chu lungril hmanglo puta an um angin um ta naw unla,"
"being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;","hrietnawna anniah a um, chu hrietnawna lei chun Pathien hring- naa inthawka ṭhea hung umin, an hrietnaa chun an hung inthim a nih; an lungril a ngawng leiin,"

But ye did not so learn Christ;,Nangni ruok chun chuong angin Krista chu in inchûk nawh a;
"if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:","a rawl chu in ngai tah a, ama inchûktirhai in ni angin Isua thutak um chu inchûktirin in um tah a."
"that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;","Chuleiin, in tienlai umdân kawnga mihriem hlui, hlêmna châknaa se deu deu kha hlîp thla unla;"
"and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,","in lungril thlaraua chun a tharin hung um unla,"
"and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.","mihriem thar, felna le inthieng- na indiktaka Pathien angpuia siem chun inthuom ro."
"Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.","Chuongchun, khêl hril bânin mani vênghai kuomah thu indiktak hril seng ro; inpêngtuo seng ei ni sih a."
"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:",Lunginsen unla khawm a suol ruok chu suol naw ro; in lungsen chu nisain tlâkpui naw raw se:
neither give place to the devil.,Diebol chu hmun inkien bawk naw ro.
"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.","Inruhmang chun inru ta naw sien la, a tlasam kuoma pêk ding a nei theina dingin a kuta thil ṭha thawin inrim lem raw se."
"Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.","Thu ṭhanaw hrim in bauah suok naw sien la, a ṭul zie ang peia siem ṭha dingin thu ṭha suok lem raw se, a ngaituhai dingin lunginsietna a hung ni theina dingin."
"And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.","Chun, Pathien Thlarau In- thieng chu suklungngai naw ro, in- tlanna nia dingin amaa chun inchika in um kha."
"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:","Khâkna dâm, lunginsenna dâm, inngâwkna dâm, hrângna dâm, hrilsietna dâm po po bânsanin um raw se, suolna po po leh."
"and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.","Chun, inlunginsiet tuoa, lainat- na neiin um unla, Pathienin Kristaa a ngaidam ang bawk cheuin inngai- dam tuo ro."
"and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.","Chun, Kristain a hmangai cheu a, riminhnik dinga Pathien kuoma thil inhlâna ding le, inthâwinaa ei aia ân pêk ang bawk khan, hmangainaah um ro."
"Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;","Chuongchun, a nau dittakhai angin Pathien umdân latuhai ni ro."
"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;","Nisienlakhawm, mi inthienghai thawa mawi âwm tak hrimin, inditna le inthiengnawna po po, duamna leh nangni laiah a sâma sâm khawmin um naw raw se;"

"For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.","Indithmang le mi inthiengnaw le mi duâm hrim hrim chu, (mi duâm chu milim betu a nih), Krista le Pathien rama chun chan hrim an nei nawh ti in hriet hle sih a."
Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.,"Tûkhawmin thu teplo mei meiin hlêm naw raw se cheu, chuong thil lei chun Pathien lunginsenna chu ringnaw nauhai chungah a tlung hlak sih a."
Be not ye therefore partakers with them;,"Chuleiin, anni inṭawmpui naw ro."
"for ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light","Inhma khan inthim in na, tu ruok hin chu Lalpaa chun var in hung ni ta hi, var nauhai angin um ro,"
"(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),",(var ra chu ṭhatna le felna le thutak po poah ânlang sih a).

"and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;","Chun, inthim thilthaw ra nei ngailohaia chun ṭhangna hrim nei naw ro, ṭhang nêk hmanin a thiemnawzie inhriettir lem ro;"
for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.,inrûka an thil thaw hlakhai chu a hril khawm inzak a um sih a.
But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.,"Amiruokchu, thil tinrêng a thiemnawzie inhriettira um hi var isuklang a ni hlak; suklanga um taphawt chu var a ni sih a."
"Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.","Chuleiin, “Nang a in! meng la, Mithi laia inthawkin tho rawh. Chuongchun, Krista chun, Hung ên var a ti che,” a ti kha."
"Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;","Chuongchun, mi varnawhai anga um loin, mi varhai anga um lemin, in um dânah fîmkhur ro."
"redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",Nihai hi a ṭhat naw leiin remchângnahai inchaw pei ro.
"Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.","Chuleichun, invêt nuom naw unla, Lalpa ditzâwng ieng am a na ti lo hre lem ro."
"And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;","Chun, uoin inruiin um naw ro, chutaka chun insûm nawna a um sih a; Thlaraua sipin um lem ro."
"speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;","Inpâkna hlahai, Pathien hlahai, thlarau tieng hlahaia inbe tuoin, Lalpa chu in lungrilah hla sakpêkin, ṭingṭang kei pêk ro."
"giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin, Pathien, Pa ngei kuoma chun, iengkim chungah lâwmthu hril ro."
subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.,Krista ṭi dêkin intuklût tuo seng ro.
"Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.","Nuhmeihai, Lalpa kuoma in intuklût ang hin mani pasalhai kuomah intuklût seng ro."
"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.","Krista chu ama ngei taksa sandamtu nia, kohran lu a ni ang bawk hin, pasal chu a nuhmei lu a ni sih a."
"But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.","Chuongchun, kohran chu Krista kuoma ân tuklût ang bawkin, nu- hmeihai chu iengkimah an pasalhai kuomah intuklût raw hai se."
"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;","Pasalhai, in nuhmeihai hma- ngai ro, Kristain kohran a hmangai a, a aia ama ân pêk ang khan,"
"that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,","kohran chu tuia sâwpa, thu chun sukfaia ân thieng theina dingin;"
"that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.","fainawna kai lo le, zûr lo le, chuong ang thil hrim put loa, inthieng le hmêlhem nawa um lemin, ama kuoma vêk kohran ropui taka a pêk theina dingin."
Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:,Chuong ang bawkin pasalhai khawmin mani taksa angin mani nuhmeihai chu an hmangai ding a nih. Mani nuhmei hmangaitu chu mani inhmangai a nih.
"for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;","Tukhawmin, mani taksa a theida ngai si nawh a, a châwmin a duot lem hlak a nih."
because we are members of his body.,Kristain kohran a châwma a duot ang hin; a taksa pênghai ei ni sih a.
"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.","“Chuleiin, pasalin a nu le pa mâksanin a nuhmei chel a ta, chun, an pahni chun tisa pumkhat hung ni tâng an tih.”"
This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.,"Chu thurûk chu a ropui a nih; nisienlakhawm, kei chun Krista le kohran thu ka hrilna a nih."
Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.,"Iengkhawm ni sien la, nangni laia mi tûkhawmin mani ân hmangai ang bawkin, mani nuhmei hmangai seng raw hai se; nuhmei khawm chu a pasal ṭi dêk dingin fimkhur raw se."
"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.","Naupanghai, Lalpaa chun in nu le pahai thu zâwm ro, chu chu thil indik a ni sih a."
"Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),","“I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,” (Chu chu thupêk tiem nei hmasa tak a nih)."
"that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.","“Chuongchun, i ta dingin ṭhâng a ta, hnuoiah dam sâwt i tih.”"
"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.","Chun, nangni pahai, in nauhai suklungsen naw unla, Lalpa thunun- na le kâwknaa chun enkawl lem ro."
"Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;","Suokhai, Krista thu zâwm angin, ṭidêk le inthina, lungril sakhat putin, hnuoia in hotuhai thu zâwm ro."
"not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;","Mihriem suklâwmtuhai ang ela mit rawng bâwl loin, Krista suok anga lungrila Pathien ditzâwng thaw lemin,"
"with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men:","mihriem rawng bâwl ang el ni loin, Lalpa rawngbâwl ang lema inhâwktaka bâwlin;"
"knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether he be bond or free.","suok ni sienla, suok ni naw sienla khawm, mi tinin thil ṭha an thaw senghai chu Lalpa kuoma inthawkin a ngai bawk hmu nâwk an tih ti hre zing ro."
"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.","Chun, nangni hotuhai, chuong ang bawkin, anni le nangni hotu chu vânah a um ti le, ama chun mi ditsak bîk a nei nawh ti hrein, vau loin an chungah thaw ve ro."
"Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.",A tâwp taka chun Lalpaa le a hrâtna thahruia chun thilthawtheina neiin um ro.
"Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.",Diebol zâwrnahai chu in do zona dingin Pathien râlthuom famkimin inthuom ro.
"For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.","Ei ibuonhai hi tisa le thisen an ni si nawh a; inlalnahai le thuneina- hai le, hi inthim chunga khawvêl rorêltuhai le, vân hmunhaia thlarau suol umhai chu an ni lem."
"Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.","Chuleiin, ni ṭha nawa chun in do zona ding le, in thaw zo hnung khawma in ngîr theina dingin Pathien râlthuom famkim chu la ro."
"Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,","Chuongchun, in kâwng chu thutaka hrênin, felna âwmphaw chu hâkin,"
and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;,remna Chanchin Ṭha inbuot- saina chu in kea bunin ngîr ro.
"withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.","Chu naw khawm chu ringna phaw la unla, chu chun mi suol thal chawk thei po po chu sukmit thei in tih."
"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:","Chun, sandamna lukhum le Thlarau ngûnhnâm (Pathien Thu chu) la unla, ṭawngṭaina le hnina tinrêngin,"
"with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,","ieng huna khawm Thlaraua ṭawngṭaiin, chu kawnga chun mi inthieng po pohai ta dingin ṭhahnem- ngai tak le hni tlatin ngaiven ro:"
"and on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,","Chanchin Ṭha thurûk huoitaka puong dinga ka bau ka ka a, thu inhriltira ka um theina dingin ka ta ding khawmin mi hnipêk ro:"
"for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.",chu kawnga chun ka thu hril ding ang chu huoitaka ka hril theina dingin. Chu Chanchin Ṭha palai khaidiet bun ka nih.
"But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:","Chun, nangni khawmin iengtin am ka um a, ka chanchin in hriet theina dingin, Tukik, Lalpaa unau dittak le ringumtak hin iengkim inhriettir a ti cheu:"
"whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.","hi lei tak hin ama chu in kuomah ka hung tir a nih, kan chan- chin in hriet theina ding le ama hin in lungril a sukthlamuong theina dingin."
"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",Pa Pathien le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka inremna le ringna ṭhang hmangaina unauhai kuoma khan um raw se.
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ with a love incorruptible.,Ei Lalpa Isu Krista chuoiloa hmangaituhai po po kuomah lunginsietna um raw se.
