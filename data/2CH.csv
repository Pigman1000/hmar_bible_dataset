"And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.","Chun, David naupa Solomon chu a rama chun sukdet a ni tah a, LALPA a Pathien chu a kuomah a um a, ama chu nasatakin a chawimawi a."
"And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ houses.","Solomon chun, Israel mi po pohai le, sipai za khat pâwl le sâng khat pâwl hotuhai kuoma le, rorêltuhai kuoma le, Israel rama lalhai po po kuoma le, pahnam luhai kuoma chun thu a hril a."
"So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.","Chuongchun, Solomon le a kuoma mipui inkhâwmhai po po chu Gibeona bâwlhmuna chun an hang fe tah a; LALPA siehlaw Mosien thla- lêra Pathien ta dinga intuokna in a siem chu chutaka chun a um sih a."
But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien bâwm chu David chun Kiriath-jearima in- thawk khan a hung lâk a, Davidin a siena dinga a buotsai hmuna khan a lo sie tah a; Jerusalema khan, chu hmun ding chun puon in a lo zâr ta sih a."
"Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.","Chunawa khawm, dârsen mâi- châm Hur naupa, Uri naupa Bezalel- in a lo siem ta chu LALPA biekbûk hmaa chun a um bawk a; Solomon le mipui chun an va pan a."
"And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.","Chun, Solomon chu LALPA hmaa dârsen mâichâm intuokna ina uma chun a hang feh a, a chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân sâng khat lai ân hlân a."
"In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.","Chu zân chun Solomon kuomah LALPA chu a hung inlâr a, a kuomah, “Ieng am a na ka pêk ding che, mi hni rawh,” a ta."
"And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.","Solomon chun Pathien kuoma chun, “Ka pa David kuoma chun lung- insietna nasatak i lo inentir tah a, ama aia chun tuhin lalah i mi siem tah a."
"Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.","Tuhin, Aw LALPA Pathien, ka pa David kuoma i thutiem chu suk- puitling ni raw se; tam tienga hnuoia pilvut zât rau ang mipui chunga hin lalah i mi siem ta sih a."
"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?","Hi mipuihai hmaa hin ka lûta ka suok theina dingin tuhin varna le hrietthiem theina nangin mi pe la; chuong naw chun, hi i mihai hieng zât lâwm lâwm hi tuin am ro rêlpêk thei an ta?” a ta."
"And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:","Pathien chun Solomon kuomah, “Hi hi i lungrilah a um a, hausak- nahai, neinungnahai le inzaumnahai amanih, nangma theidatuhai che hringna amanih, i hni nawh a, dam sâwtna khawm i hni bawk nawh a, amiruokchu, ka mihai, an chunga lala ka siemnahai che chu ro i rêl- pêk theina dinga nangma ta dinga varna le hrietthiem theina i hni lem leiin;"
"wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.","varna le hrietthiem theina chu i kuoma pêk a ni tah a; i hmaa lalhai tukhawma an nei dêr lo le, nangma hnunga tukhawma chuong anga an nei dêr lo ding hausaknahai le, nei- nungnahai le, inzâkaina pêng ka ti che,” a ta."
"So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.","Chuongchun, Solomon chu a vân zinna Gibeona bâwlhmun, in- tuokna puon in hmaa inthawk chun Jerusalema chun a hung tah a; chuongchun, Israel chunga chun ro a rêl tah a."
"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.","Chun, Solomon chun sakawr tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai chu a kei khâwm a, sakawr tawlailîr sâng khat le za li le, sakawr chung chuong mi sîng khat le sâng hni a nei a; chuong chu sakawr tawlailîr khawpuiahai le lal kuomah Jerusalema chun a sieh a."
"And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.","Chun, lal chun tangka le râng- kachak chu Jerusalema chun lung ang el le, Sidar thing chu phai rama theichang kûng ang ela tama intiengin a sieh a."
"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.","Chun, Solomonin sakawr a neihai chu Aigupta rama inthawka inchâwk suok vawng an nih; lal sumdâwng mihai chun a ruol ruolin an lo khâr hlak a, a ruola inchâwk pei a nih;"
"And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.","chuongchun, an hung lâk a, Aiguptaa inthawkin sakawr tawlailîr chu tangkaruo shekel za ruk peiin an intlungtir bawk a; chun, sakawrhai chu Hit mi lalhai le Suria lalhai ta ding khawmin an suktlungpêk hlak a; sakawrhai chu tangkaruo shekel za le sâwmnga peiin an intlungtir a nih."
And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.,Rehoboam chu Sekema chun a feh a; Israelhai po po chu ama chu lala siem dingin Sekema chun an hung sih a.
"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.","Chun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam chun chu chu a lo hriet chun, (Solomon hmaa inthawka a tlân- hmangna Aigupta rama chun a la um a ni sih a.) Jeroboam chu Aigupta rama inthawk chun a hung kîr tah a."
"And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,","Chun, mi an tir a, ama chu an ko tah a; chuongchun, Jeroboam le Israelhai po po chu an hung a, Rehoboam kuoma chun an hril a,"
"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.","“I pa khan kan rîngkawl chu riktakin a lo siem tah a; chuleiin, tuhin i pa rawngbâwlna riktak le, kan chunga rîngkawl rik ân nghat hi mi sukzâng pêk la, chuongchun, i rawngbâwl kan tih,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.","Anni kuoma chun, “Ni thum hnungah ka kuomah hung nâwk ro,” a lo tih a, chuongchun, mipui chu an fe tah a."
"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?","Chun, Rehoboam chun mi upa- hai, a pa Solomon damlaia a hmaa ngîr hlakhai chu, “Hi mipuihai hi dawn kirna dingin ieng thurâwn am in mi pêk a,” tiin, a râwn a."
"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hi mipui chunga hin za i ngai a, anni hi i suklungawi a, an kuomah thu ṭha i hril chun kumkhuoin i siehlawhai nîng an tih,” an ta."
"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.","Nisienlakhawm, upahai thurâwn ama an pêk ta chu a nghatsan a, ama hmaa ngîr hlak, ama ruolpuihai tlangvâlhai chu a rawn tah a."
"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?","An kuoma chun, “Hieng mipui, ‘I pain kan chunga rîngkawl a innghat hi mi sukzângpêk rawh,’ tituhai hi ieng dawnna am ei inkîr thei ding ieng am thurâwn in nei a?” a ta."
"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.","Tlangvâlhai, ama ruolpuihai chun an hril a, a kuomah, “ ‘I pain kan rîngkawl a sukrik êm a, nangin keini mi sukzângpêk rawh,’ i kuoma tituhai mipui kuoma chun hieng ang hin ti la, hieng ang hin an kuoma chun hril rawh, ‘Ka kutte chu ka pa kâwng- bâwr nêkin a lien lem a."
"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.","Tuhin ka pain rîngkawl rik a lo inphurtir ta cheu a; kei chun in rîng- kawl chu belsâng ka tih; ka pain vuoknain a lo hrem cheu a ni chun, kei chun ainuvêtin hrem ka ti cheu,’ tiin,” an tih a."
"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.","Chuongchun, Jeroboam le mi- puihai po po chu ni thum ni chun lalin, Ni thum niah ka kuomah hung nâwk ro, tia a lo inthla ang khan a kuomah an hung tah a."
"And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,","Lal chun vîntakin a lo dawn a; lal Rehoboam chun mi upahai thurâwn chu a nghatsan a,"
"and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.","tlangvâlhai thurâwn angin, “Ka pa chun in rîngkawl chu a lo sukrik hle tah a, keiin chu chu belsâng ka ta; ka pain vuoknain a lo hrem cheu a ni chun, kei chun chu ainuvêtin hrem ka ti cheu,” tiin a lo hril a."
"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","Chuongchun, lal chun mipuihai thu chu a ngai nawh a; Silon mi Ahija hmanga Nebat naupa Jeroboam kuoma a thu lo hril tah, a thu chu LALPAIN ân tlungtir theina ding- in, Pathienin a hung intlungtir a ni sih a."
"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.","Chuonga Israel po po chun lal chun an thu a ngai nawh ti an hriet chun mipuihai chun an dawn a, “David a hin chanvo ieng am ei nei hrim luoh a? Jesai naupaa hin rochan ieng khawm ei nei bawk nawh; mi tin mâni puon in sengah fe ro, Aw Israel- hai: David, tuhin nangma insûng ngei chu inngaituo ta,” tiin."
"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po chu an puon inhaia chun an ṭin tâwl tah a. Amiruokchu, Judai ram khaw- puihaia umhai Israel thlahai chunga khan chu Rehoboam chun ro a rêl zing a."
"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun Hadoram, leiman hotu chu a tir a, Israel thlahai chun ama chu lungin an lo dêng a, a thi tah a. Chun, lal Rehoboam chu a sakawr tawlailîrah a chuong a, inhmâwtakin Jerusalemah a tlânse tah a."
So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.,"Chuongchun, Israel sûngkuo chu David sûngkuo chunga chun, vawisûn ni chen hin an hel tah a."
"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.","Rehoboam chu Jerusalem a hung tlung chun Benjamin le Juda sûngkuo, nuoi khat le sîng riet, thlang ṭhieu, Israelhai do dinga indo mi, Rehoboam ta dinga ram chu hung la kîr nâwk dingin a ko khâwm tawl a."
"But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi Semaia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a,"
"Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,","“Judai ram lal Solomon naupa Rehoboam le, Judai rama Benjamin mihai le Israel mi po pohai kuoma chun thu hril la,"
"Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.","LALPAIN hieng hin a tih ti rawh, ‘Hang fe nâwng in ta, in unauhai chu indopui bawk nâwng in tih: mi tin chu mâni in sengah kîr nâwk el ro: hi thil hi keima thaw a ni sih a,’ tiin,” a ta. Chuongchun, LALPA thu chu an zâwm a, Jeroboam hang do tumnaa inthawk chun an kîr tah a."
"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.","Rehoboam chu Jerusalema chun a um a, Judai rama inhumhimna dingin khawpuihai a bâwl a."
"He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,","Bethlehem dâm, Etam dâm, Tekoa dâm,"
"And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,","Beth-zur dâm, Soko dâm, Adullam dâm,"
"and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,","Gath dâm, Maresah dâm, Ziph dâm,"
"and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,","Adoraim dâm, Lakis dâm, Azeka dâm,"
"and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.","Zora dâm, Aijalon dâm, Hebron dâm, chuong chu Judai rama umhai le, Benjamin rama khawpui kul neihai a nih."
"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.","Chun, kul dettakhai chu a sukdet nâwk zuol a, chuonga chun hotuhai a sieh a, fâk ding le hriek le uoin dâm ân khâwl bawk a."
"And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.","Khaw tin hmun tamtaka chun feihai, phâwhai a sieh a, nasatak- in a sukhrât a. Judai hnam le Benjamin hnam chu ama tieng an ṭhang a."
And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.,Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu an umna sûnga inthawk chun ama kuomah Israel ram sûng po poa chun an hung pakai a.
"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office unto Jehovah;","Levi mihai chun an ram le an khuohai chu an mâksan a, Jerusalem le Judai rama chun an hung a; Jeroboam le a naupasalhai chun anni chu LALPA ta dinga thiempu sinhai chu thaw lo dingin an hnawt suok sih a,"
"and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.","chuongchun, ama siem bâwng- têhai, kêlchalhai le bâwlhmunhaia ding chun thiempuhai a ruot fâwm tah a."
"And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chun, an hnunga khawm chun, Israel hnamhai lai po poa mi, Israel Pathien LALPA chu lungrila zawng- tuhai chun an zui a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuoma inthâwi ding chun Jerusalemah an hung hlak a."
"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.","Chuongchun, kum thum sûng chun Judai lalram chu an sukdet tiel tiel a, Solomon naupa Rehoboam chu ân sukdet hle el tah a; kum thum sûng chu David le Solomon lampui chu an hraw sih a."
"And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;","Chun, Rehoboam chun David naupa Jerimoth le Jesai naupa Eliab naunu Abihail naunu Mahalath chu nuhmeiah a nei a;"
"and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.",amanu chun naupasalhai a neipêk a; Jeus le Semaria le Zaham.
"And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.","Ama hnunga chun Absalom naunu Maaka chu a nei a; ama chun Abija, Attai, Ziza le Selomith a nei- pêk a."
"And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters).","Chun, Rehoboam chun a nu- hmeihai le a thaikêmhai po po nêkin Absalom naunu Maaka chu a hmangai lem a, (nuhmei chu sâwm- pariet a nei a, thaikêm sâwmruk leh; chun, naupasal sâwmhni pariet le naunuhmei sâwmruk a nei bawk sih a)."
"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, even the prince among his brethren; for he was minded to make him king.","Chun, Rehoboam chun Maaka naupa Abija chu lalah, a unauhai laia hotutakah a ruot a; ama chu lala siem a lungril sih a."
"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought for them many wives.","Chun, vartakin a thawh a, Juda le Benjamin ram po poa chun a nau- pasalhai chu a semdar rak a, khaw- pui kul neihai po poa chun; fâk ding khawm tam tâwk takin a pêk bawk a. An ta dingin nuhmeihai khawm tamtak a zawngpêk bawk a."
"And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.","Rehoboam ram chu sukdet a hung na, a hung hrât phing chun, LALPA dân chu a nghatsan tah a, Israelhai po po khawm chun ama an zui veh a."
"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,","Chun, Rehoboam inlal kum nganaa chun Aigupta rama lal Sisak chun Jerusalem a hung rûn a, LALPA chungah an lo bawsiet ta leiin;"
"with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.","sakawr tawlailîr sâng le za hni le sakawr chung chuong mi sîng ruk leh; Aigupta rama inthawka ama hung zuitu Lubim mihai, Sukkiim mihai, Ethiopia mihai le chu tiem sêng ruol lo an nih."
"And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.","Chun, Judai rama khawpui kul neihai chu a lâk a, chuongchun, Jerusalema chun a hung pei a."
"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.","Chun, zâwlnei Semaia chu Rehoboam le hotu, Judai ram Sisak leia Jerusalema hung khâwmhai kuoma chun a hung a, an kuoma chun, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Kei in mi nghatsan tah, kei khawma Sisak kutah ka mâksan ding cheu a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.","Chun, lal tak le Israel upahai chu an insukhnuoi a, “LALPA chu a fel a nih,” an tih a."
"And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.","LALPA chun anni chu an insuk- hnuoi ti a hmu phing chun, Semaia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung tah a, “Anni le anni chu an insukhnuoi a, anni chu sukbohmang vawng naw ning a, amiruokchu, ṭhenkhat sansuokna chu phalpêk ka ta, Sisak kuta hin, Jerusalem chunga ka lungsenna chu bunthlâk ni naw ni."
"Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.","Amiruokchu, a siehlawhai hung nîng an ta, hieng ramhaia lalram rawngbâwlna le ka rawngbâwlna chu an hriet theina dingin,” tiin."
"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.","Chuongchun, Aigupta lal Sisak chun Jerusalem chu a hung rûn a, lal in rothilhai le LALPA in rothilhai chu a lâk hmang a; chuong chu a lâk hmang vawng a, Solomonin rângka- chak phaw a siemhai khawm kha a lâk hmang vawng a."
"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king’s house.","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun chuong aia chun dârsen phâwhai a siem a, lal in kawtkhâr vêngtu, vêng- tu pâwl hotu kuoma chun ân kawl- tir a."
"And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.","LALPA ina chun lal chu a lût po leh, vêngtu chu a hung a, chuong phâwhai chu a chawi hlak a; chun, vêngtu pindana chun a sie kîr nâwk hlak a nih."
"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things found.","Chun, ama chu ân sukhnuoi tâk lei chun LALPA lunginsenna chu ama sukbohmang let dêr lo dingin lâk- kieng a lo ni tah a; chunawa khawm, Judai ram chu a la ṭha zing bawk a."
"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.","Chuongchun, lal Rehoboam chu Jerusalema chun ân sukdet a, ro a rêl tah a, ro a rêl ṭan tir chun Rehoboam chu kum sâwmli le kum khat a ni tah a, chun, Jerusalemah, Israel hnam po po laia inthawka a hming um zingna dinga LALPAIN a thlang suok khaw- puia chun kum sâwmpasari a rêl bawk a; a nu hming chu Ammon mi Naama a nih."
"And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.",LALPA chu zawng dinga a lungril a hmang naw leiin thil ṭha naw chu a thaw tah a.
"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.","Chuongchun, Rehoboam thil- thawhai, a hmasa le nuhnunghai khawm, thla thu sui dân ang peiin zâwlnei Iddo le zâwlnei Semaia chanchinbuhaia chun ziek an ni naw am a nih? Chun, Rehoboam le Jero- boam inkâra hin indonahai a um zing zing bawk a."
"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Rehoboam chu a thla- tuhai kuomah a in tah a, David khawpuia chun phûmin a um a; chun, a naupa Abija chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.,Jeroboam inlal kum sâwm- parietnaa chun Abija chun Juda rama chun ro a rêl ṭan a.
Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.,"Ama chun kum thum lai Jerusalemah ro a rêl a; a nu hming chu Mikaia, Gibea mi, Uriel naunu kha a nih. Chun, Jeroboam le Abija inkâra khawm chun indona a um a."
"And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.",Abija chun indonaa mi hrât ruol sipai pâwl thlang ṭhieu nuoi li lai chun indonaa chun a hang thaw a; Jeroboam khawm chun mi hrât khawkhêng thlang ṭhieu nuoi riet leh indonaa chun ama chu a hung ep ve bawk a.
"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:","Abija chu Ephraim tlâng rama Zemaraim tlâng chunga chun a ngîr a. “Aw Jeroboam le Israel mi po pohai, mi lo ngai ta u;"
"Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?","LALPA Israelhai Pathienin David le a thlahai kuomah Israel ram chu kumkhuoa dingin machi thuthlung hmangin a pêk a nih, ti in hriet naw am a ni?"
"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.","David naupa Solomon siehlaw, Nebat naupa Jeroboam hi thoin, a pu chungah a lo hel el hi."
"And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.","Chun, ama kuoma chun mi teplohai, mi hmangna bohai chu an inkhâwm a, Rehoboam chu a la nau- panga, lungril dâwng a ni lai khan, anni chu Solomon naupa Rehoboam kalin an insukhrât a, ama chun a lo dang zo ta naw kha a na."
"And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.","Chun, tuhin David naupasalhai kuta LALPA ram chu do thei dingin in inngaituoh a, mipui nasatak in na, in kuoma chun in pathienhai dinga Jeroboamin a siem rângkachak bâwngtehai chu an um bawk a."
"Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.","LALPA thiempuhai Aron nau- pasalhai le Levi mihai chu in hnawtsuokin, ram dang mihai dân angin thiempuhai in insiem fâwm a ni naw am a nih? chuleichun, mi tukhawm berâm pasari le bâwngchal tuoia ama inpumpêk dinga hung taphawt chu pathien ni lohai thiempuhai chu an ni thei pei a."
"But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and we have priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:","Amiruokchu, keini chu LALPA chu kan Pathien a na, ama chu kan nghatsan nawh a; LALPA ta dinga rawngbâwltu thiempu kan neihai chu Aron naupasalhai an na, Levi chihaiin an ṭhangpui a;"
"and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.","riminhnik thilinhlânhai le pum- rawhmang thilinhlânhai chu zîng tin le zân tin LALPA kuoma chun an rawh a; entirna bei khawm chu dawkân inthieng chunga chun indawt thliein an sieh a; chun, rângkachak sathâu khâwnvar siena khawm, chutaka a khâwnvarhai zân tina sit ding leh; LALPA kan Pathien thupêk ang chu kan kawl zing a; amiruokchu, nangni chun in nghatsan a ni hi."
"And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.","Chun, en ta u, Pathien chu kan hma tieng keini lai a um a; in chunga inlâuna sukri dingin suklauna taw- tawrâwthai le thiempuhai chu an um bawk a; Aw Israel thlahai, in thla- tuhai Pathien LALPA chu do naw ro khai; in hlawtling naw ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.","Nisienlakhawm, Jeroboam chun an hnung tienga hung dingin lambun pâwl a siem a; chuongchun, Juda hmaa chun an um a, lambun pâwl chu an hnunga chun an um bawk a."
"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.","Chun, Juda mihai chu an hei nghakîr chun, ngai ta, râl chu an hma le hnunga chun an um tah a; LALPA chu an ko a, thiempuhai chun taw- tawrâwthai chu an mût tah a."
"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.","Chun, Juda mihai chu an khêk a; chuonga Juda mihai an khêk chun, Pathienin Israelhai po po le Jeroboam chu Abija le Juda mihai hmaa chun a hung suktlâwm tah a."
And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.,"Chuongchun, Juda mihai hmaa inthawk chun Israel mihai chu an tlânseh a; chun, Pathienin an kuta chun anni chu a pêk tah a."
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.,"Abija le a mihai chun nasatakin anni chu an that tah a, chuongchun, thlang ṭhieu Israel mi nuoi nga chu thatin an tlu tah a."
"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chuongchun, chu huna chun Israel thlahai chu sukhnuoiin an um tah a, Juda thlahai ruok chun an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an ringsan leiin an hne tah a."
"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.","Abija chun Jeroboam chu a hnawt pei a, amaa inthawk chun khawpuihai a lâk a; Bethel le chutaka a khawperhai leh, Jesana le chutaka a khawperhai leh, Ephron le chutaka a khawperhai leh."
"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.","Abija dam sûng chun Jeroboam chu a hrât suok nâwk ta ngai nawh a; LALPA chun a hrem a, ama chu a thi tah a."
"But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.","Chun, Abija chun thil a hung thawthei deu deu a, nuhmei sâwm pali a nei a, naupasal sâwmhni pahni le naunuhmei sâwmparuk a nei a."
"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.","Abija thilthaw danghai, a thaw- dânhai le a thuhrilhai chu zâwl- nei Iddo hrilfiena bua chun ziek an nih."
"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.","Chuongchun, Abija chu a thlatuhai kuoma chun a in tah a, ama chu David khawpuia chun an phûm a, a naupa Asa chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a; ama inlal sûng chun kum sâwm sûng chu ram chu râlmuongin a um a."
And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:,"Chun, Asa chun a Pathien, LALPA mithmuah thil indik le ṭhahai chu a thawh a;"
"for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,","bâwlhmunhai le mâichâm dang- lamhai chu a lâk hmang a, lungphun- hai chu a sukthliek a, Asera chu a phûr thlûk bawk a;"
"and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.","chun, Juda mihai chu an thla- tuhai Pathien LALPA chu zawnga thupêk le dânhai chu thaw pei dingin thu a pêk bawk a."
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.,Juda ram sûng khawpui po pohaia inthawk chun bâwlhmunhai le nisa limhai chu a lâk hmang vawng a; ram chu ama hmaa chun a re ṭawk ṭawk a.
"And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.","Juda rama chun khawpui kul neihai chu a bâwl a, LALPAIN ama chu châwlna a pêk leiin, ram chu a re ṭawk ṭawk a, chuong kumahai chun indona a nei si nawh a."
"For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.","Chun, ama chun, Juda mihai kuoma chun, “Hieng khawpuihai hi bâwl ei tiu a, a banghai, a kulbîng insânghai, a dai kawtkhârhai le a kalna thîrhai siem ei tiu; ei Pathien LALPA chu ei zawng leiin ram chu ei hnuoiah a um a nih; ama chu ei zawng leiin kil tinah ama chun châwl a mi pêk a ni hi,” a ta. Chuongchun, an bâwl a, hlaw khawm an hlawtling pei tah a."
"And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.","Chun, Asa chun Juda hnama inthawkin âwmphâw le fei chawi mi sipai nuoi thum a nei a; Benjamin hnama inthawkin phaw chawia thal- ngul kuoi mi nuoi hni le sîng riet a nei bawk a: hieng mihai po po hi mi hrât khawkhêng ruok an nih."
"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.","Chun, Ethiopia mi Zera chun sipai maktaduoi khat le sakawr tawlailîr za thum leh anni chu a hung thawh a; ama chu Maresa chenin a hung a."
"Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.","Chun, Asa chu ama tuok ding chun a suok a, Maresaa Zephatha ruoma chun indo ding chun an inep tah a."
"And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.","Asa chu a Pathien LALPA kuoma chun a khêk a, “LALPA chau naw chu, hrâtna nei lo mihai ta dinga, mi thilthawtheia inthawka ṭhangpui ding mi dang tukhawm an um nawh a; Aw LALPA kan Pathien, mi ṭhang- pui la; nangmaah kan innghat sih a, hi mipui hi i hming leiin kan hung do a ni hi. Aw LALPA nang chu kan Pathien i na, nangma chu tukhawma hne naw raw se che,” tiin."
"So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Asa hmaa le Juda mihai hmaa chun Ethiopia mihai chu a hung thawh a; Ethiopia mihai chu an tlânse tah a."
"And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.","Asa le a kuoma mipui umhai chun anni chu Gerar chenin an hnawt a; Ethiopia mihai chu nasatakin an thi a, ṭhang an khaw thei ta nawh a; LALPA le a sipaihai hmaa chun sukbohmangin an um a; anni chun râllâk sum tamtak an lâk a."
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.,"Chun, Gerar vêla khuohai po po chu a thaw vawng a, LALPA ṭitna chu an chunga chun a hung tlung tâwl sih a, khawpuihai po po chu an suksiet a, chuonga hai chun râllâk thil tam- takhai chu a um sih a."
"They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.","Ran ruol bûkhai chu an rûn pei a, berâm tamtakhai le sanghâwngsei leh an lâk ṭeu a, Jerusalemah an kîr tah a."
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:,"Chun, Oded naupa Azaria chunga chun Pathien thlarau a hung a;"
"and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.","Asa chu tuok dingin a va fe suok a, a kuoma chun, “Nangni Asa le Benjamin le Juda ram po pohai, mi lo ngai ta u; a kuoma in um sûng po chun LALPA chu in kuomah a um a; chun, ama chu in zawng chun in ihmuin um a ta; amiruokchu, ama chu in nghatsan chun nghatsan vêng a ti cheu."
"Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:","Chuongchun, hun sâwttak el chu Israel ram chu Pathien indiktak bo, inchûktirtu thiempu le dân boin an lo um tah a;"
"but when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.","amiruokchu, an rimsiknaa chun Israel Pathien LALPA kuom tieng chun an kîr nâwk a, ama chu an zawng a, an hmu a ni kha."
"And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.","Chuong lai hunahai chun mi hung lût ta ding le a suok ta ding khawm chun muongna hrim hrim a um nawh a, ram po pohai hluotuhai chunga chun lunginzîngna nasatak a um lem a."
"And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.","A tum tumin an insukdar vawng a, hnam chungah hnam dang, khaw- pui chungah khawpui dang; inhmêl- mâkna tinrêngin Pathienin anni chu a suklungsen tâwl sih a."
"But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.","Amiruokchu, insukhrât unla; in- thlada naw ro, in sinthaw chu lâwmman pêk in ni ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.","Asa chun hieng thu le, zâwlnei Oded thuhrilhai chu a hriet chun, ân sukhuoi a, Juda le Benjamin ram po poa le Ephraim tlâng rama khawpui a lâkhaia inthawka tirdakumnahai po po chu a sie hmang tah a; LALPA mâichâm LALPA tuolpûk hmaa um chu a siem thar bawk a."
"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.","Juda le Benjamin rama mi po po le, Ephraim le Manasse le Simeona inthawka chutaka hung inpêm lûthai chu a ko khâwm vawng a; LALPA a Pathien chu a kuomah a um ti an hmu chun Israel rama inthawkin mi tamtak chu ama kuoma chun an lo kai ta sih a."
"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.","Chuongchun, anni chu Asa rorêl kum sâwmpanga kum thla thumnaa chun Jerusalema chun an hung inkhâwm tâwl a."
"And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.","Chu ni chun râllâk thila an hung lâk, bâwngchal za sari le berâm sâng sariin LALPA kuomah an inthâwi a."
"And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;","Chun, an lungvar po po le an lungril po po an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu zawng dingin thuthlung an siem a."
"and that whosoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.","chuongchun, mi tukhawm Israel Pathien LALPA zawng lo chu mi lien amanih, mi chîn amanih, pasal amanih nuhmei amani khawm ni sienla sukhlum ding a nih."
"And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.","Chun, rawsemhai, tawtawrâwt- hai le khêkriin, râwl inringtakin LALPA kuoma chun ṭawng an inkhâm a."
"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round about.","Juda mihai po po chu thutiem chun an hlim hle a, an lungril po poin an inkhâm a, an châkna po poa ama chu an zawng leiin, ama chu an ihmua chun a um hrim a; chuong- chun, a vêlin anni chu LALPA chun muongna a pêk tah a."
"And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.","Lal Asa chun a nu Maaka khawm chu Asera ta dingin lim tirdakum chu a siem leiin lalnu a ninaa inthawk chun a bân bawk a; chun, Asa chun a milim chu a phûr thlûk a, a suknâwi vawng a, Kidron vadungtêa chun a raw tah a."
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.,"Nisienlakhawm, Israel rama inthawk chun bâwlhmunhai chu lâk hmang a ni nawh a, amiruokchu, a dam sûng po po Asa lungril chu ngiltakin a um a."
"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.","A pain a lo inhlân tahai le amain ân hlân tahai, tangkaruo dâm, râng- kachak dâm, bûr le bêlhai leh Pathien ina chun a hung lâk a."
And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.,Asa rorêl a kum sâwmthum pangana chen chun indona hrim hrim a um ta nawh a.
"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.","Asa rorêl a kum sâwmthum paruk kum chun, Israel ram lal Baasa chun Juda ram a hang rûn a, Juda ram lal Asa kuoma mi a hung amanih, a suok amanih a phal naw- na dingin Rama khuo chu a siem tah a."
"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,","Chun, Asa chun lal in le LALPA ina ro sie khâwmna ina rângkachak le tangkaruo chu a lâk suok a; Damaskaa um, Suria lal Benhadad kuoma chun ân phur a,"
"There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.","“Kei le nanga kâra hin inthu- ruolna a um a, i pa le ka pa inkâra khawm a lo um tah ang khan; ngai ta, tangkaruo le rângkachak ka hung thawn che hi; fe la, Israel ram lal Baasa le in inkâra inthuruolna chu ṭhiek rawh, keimaa inthawka a fe hmang theina dingin,” a ta."
"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.","Chun, Benhadad chun lal Asa thu chu a pawm a; Israel ram khaw- puihai chunga chun a sipaihai chu a tir tah a; chuongchun, Ijon le Dan le Abel-maim le Naphtali rama sie- khâwmna khawpuihai po po chu an rûn a."
"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.","Chun, Baasa chun chu chu a lo hriet chun Rama khuo a siem lai chu a châwlsan a, a sin chu a suktâwp tah a."
"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.","Chun, Juda lal Asa chun Juda rama mi po po chu a ṭhuoi a; Ramaa lunghai le chutaka thinghai Baasain in bâwlna dinga a hmanghai chu an phur hmang vawng a; chu chun Geba le Mizpa khuo a siem a."
"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.","Chu hun lai chun zâwlnei Hanani chu Juda ram lal Asa kuoma chun a hung a, a kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chu ring loin Suria lal chu i ring a, chuleiin, Suria lal sipaihai chu i kuta chun an suokthleng ding a nih."
"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.","Lubim mihai le Ethiopia mihai chu sakawr tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai leh tam nasatak an ni naw am a nih? amiruokchu, LALPAA chun în nghat leiin i kut- ah anni chu a pêk suok che an ni kha."
"For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.","Ama tienga lungril ṭha famkim puttuhai chunga a hrâtzie insuklang dingin LALPA mit chun hnuoi chung po poa kil le kap a en vêl ruoi hlak. Hitaka hin nang chun invêtthlâktak el chun i lo thaw tah a, chuleiin, tuta chin chu indonahai khawm nei zing tâng i tih,” a ta."
"Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.","Chun, Asa chu zâwlnei chunga chun a lunginsen a, lung ina chun ama chu a khum tah a; hi thil lei hin ama chunga chun a lunginsen sih a. Chun, Asa chun chuong lai chun mi ṭhenkhathai chu a lo nêksawr hle bawk a."
"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Asa thilthawhai, a hmasa le a nuhnunghai khawm, en ta, Juda le Israel ram lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
"And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.","A rorêl a kum sâwmthum pakuo kuma chun Asa chu a ke a hung na tah a; a natna chu a nasa hle el a, a natnaa khawm chun LALPA chu a la zawng naw rawp a, damdawi thiem mihai a ruoi lem a."
"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.","Chuongchun, Asa chu a thlatu hai kuoma chun a in tah a, a rorêl kum sâwmli pakhat kuma chun a thi tah a."
"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.","Ama thlân in David khuoa a siem ngeia chun an phûm tah a; chun, riminhnik le chawkpawl thiem mi- haiin an buotsai riminhnik tinrênga sip khuma chun an inzâltir a; ama ta ding chun meichawk nasatak chu an siem tah a."
"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.","A naupa Jehosaphat chun ama aia chun ro a hung rêl a, Israel chunga chun do dingin ân sukdet hle tah a."
"And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.","Juda rama khawpui kul neihai taphawta chun sipaihai a sieh a, Juda rama le Ephraim rama khawpui a pa Asain a lo lâk tahaia khan sipai pâwl lienhai chu a sie bawk a."
"And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim,","Chun, LALPA chu Jehosaphat kuoma chun a um a, a thlatu David lampui hmasahai chu a hraw lei le Baal chu zawng loa,"
"but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.","a thlatuhai Pathien chu zawnga, a thupêkhai chu Israel mihai thaw ang ni loa, a zâwm leiin."
Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.,"Chuleiin, LALPA chun a kuta chun ram chu a tungding a; Juda ram po po chun Jehosaphat kuoma chun thilpêkhai an hung chawi a; chuongchun, hausaknahai le inzâkaina chu nasatakin a nei tah a."
And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.,"Chun, LALPA kawngahai chun a lungril chu a thle a; chu nawa khawm Juda rama Asera le bâwlhmunhai po po chu a lâk hmang a."
"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;","Chun, ân lal a kum thum kuma chun a hotuhai Benhail, Obadia, Zekaria, Nethanel le Mikaia chu Juda ram khawpuihaia inchûktir dingin a tir tâwl a;"
"and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.","anni lai chun Levi mi Semaia, Nethania, Zebadia, Asahel, Semira- moth, Jehonathan, Adonija, Tobija, Tob-adonija le Levi mihai chu an ṭhang a; anni laia chun thiempu Elisama le Jehoram chu an ṭhang ve bawk a."
"And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.","LALPA dân lekhabu chu chawiin, Juda rama chun an inchûktir tah a; chuongchun, Juda ram khawpuiahai po po chun an fe lâwn a, mipuihai chu an inchûktir tah a."
"And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.","Chun, Judai ram vêla ramhaia lalram po poahai chun LALPA ṭina chu a um tah a; chuongchun, Jeho- saphat chu an do ngam nawh a."
"And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.","Chun, Philistin mi ṭhenkhathai chu Jehosaphat kuoma chun thil- pêkhai le, siechawi dingin tangkaruo an hung pêk a; chun, Arabia mihai khawma ran ruol, berâmchal sâng sari le za sari le, kêlchal sâng sari le za sari an hung kei a."
And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.,"Chuongchun, Jehosaphat chu nasatakin a hung lien tah a; Juda rama chun kulhai le siekhâwmna khawpuihai a siem tah a."
"And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.","Juda rama khuohaia chun sin tamtak el a nei a, chun, Jerusalema chun indo mi, mi hrât khawkhênghai a nei bawk a."
"And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;","Chun, hi hi an pahnam ang peia intiemna chu a nih: Juda hnama chun sâng chunga hotuhai chu: hotu Adna, ama hnuoia chun mi hrât ṭhieu nuoi thum an um a;"
"and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;","ama dawta chun hotu Jeho- hanan, ama hnuoia chun nuoi hni le sîng riet an um a;"
"and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.","ama dawta chun Zikri naupa Amasia, LALPA kuoma inphaltaka inpetu chu; ama hnuoia chun mi hrât khawkhêng nuoi hni an um bawk a;"
"And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;","Benjamin hnama mi chu: mi hrât khawkhêng Eliada, ama hnuoia chun mi phâw le thalngula inthuom nuoi hni an um a;"
"and next to him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war.","chun, ama dawta chun Jeho- zabad a na, ama hnuoia chun indo dinga inpeisa mi nuoi khat le sîng riet an um bawk a."
"These were they that waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.",Juda ram po poa khawpui kul neihai lalin a siehai ti loa chun hienghai hi lal vêngtuhai chu an nih.
Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.,"Jehosaphat chun hausaknahai le inzâkaina chu nasatakin a nei a, chun, Ahab le chun inpum- khatna chu a siem tah a."
"And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.","Kum ieng zât amani hnunga chun Ahab kuomah Samaria chun a zu fe thla a.

"And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.","Israel ram lal Ahab chun Juda ram lal Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Ramoth-gileadah ei hang fe ding?” a ta. Ama chun, “Kei le nang ka mihai le i mihai pumkhat ei na; indonaa chun, nangni leh ṭhang hmunkhat kan tih,” a ta."
"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.","Jehosaphat chun Israel ram lal kuoma chun, “Vawisûn hin LALPA thu chu indawn raw khai, ka hni che hi,” a ta."
"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuongchun, Israel ram lal chun zâwlnei za li lai chu a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Ramoth-gileada chun indo dingin kan hang fe ding am, an- nawleh ka tosan el ding?” a ta.

"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?","Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun, “Hienghai naw hi ei râwn thei ding LALPA zâwlnei dang hrim an um naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.","Israel lal chun Jehosaphat kûoma chun, “Mi pakhat LALPA thu ei indawn theina ding chu a la um a, amiruokchu, ama chu ka theidaa, ka chungthua hin thu a hril ṭha ngai hrim hrim nawh a, thil ṭha naw chau naw chu; chu mi chu Imla naupa Mikaia a nih,” a ta. Jehosaphat chun, “Lal chun chuong chun ti naw phawt raw se,” a ta."
"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.","Chun, Israel lal chun hotu pakhat a ko a, “Imla naupa Mikaia chu inhmâwtakin hung ṭhuoi rawh,” a ta."
"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","Chun, Israel ram lal le Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu, an lal puona inthuomin an lal ṭhungpha ve vea chun an ṭhung a; Samaria lûtna dai kawtkhâr bula tuollaia chun an ṭhung a, chuongchun, zâwlneihai po po chun an hmaa chun thu an hril ruol duol duol a."
"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.","Chun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chun thîrin saki ân siem fâwm a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Suk- bohmang an ni vawng hmakhat chu hienghai le hin Suria mihai chu i sik ding a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuongchun, zâwlneihai po po chun, chuong ang seng chun an hril tah a, “Ramoth-gileada chun hang fe la, hang hlawtling rawh, LALPA chun lal kuta chun a pêk suok ngei ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.","Chun, thangko Mikaia ko ding- a fe khan a kuomah thu a hril a, “Ngai ta, thu bau khat angin zâwl- neihai thu chun lal ta dinga ṭha chu an hril seng a; chuleiin, ka hni che hi, nanga thu khawm chu anni hril ang bawk chu ni sienla, thu ṭha hril rawh,” tiin."
"And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.","Mikaia chun, “LALPA chu a hring zing a, ka Pathienin a hril chu, chu chu ngei chu hril ka tih,” a ta."
"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.","Chun, lal kuom a hung tlung chun lal chun a kuomah, “Mikaia, Ramoth-gileada chun indo dingin kan hang fe ding am, annawleh ka tosan el ding?” a ta. Ama chun, “Hang fe la, hang hlawtling rawh, i kutah pêk suok an ni ding a nih,” a ta."
"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?","Chun, lal chun a kuoma, “LALPA hmingin thudik chau naw chu iengkhawm ka kâwlah i hril ngai nawh ti hi vawi iengzât rau am ka sukdetpui ding che a na?” a ta."
"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.","Ama chun, “Israel mihai po po chu, berâm a vêngtu boa, an invâk hmang angin tlângahai chun indarin ka hmuh a; chun, LALPA chun, ‘Hienghai hin vêngtu an nei nawh a, mi tin chu mâni in sengah thla- muongtakin inkîrtir seng ro,’ a tih,” tiin."
"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?","Chun, Israel ram lal chun Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Keima chungthua chun a se tieng chau naw chu a ṭha tieng chun thu hril naw ni ti ka hril hrim che a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And Micaiah said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.","Chun, Mikaia chun a hril a, “Chuleichun, LALPA thu chu ngai rawh. LALPA chu a lalṭhungphaa chun ṭhung a, vân sipaihai po po chu a changtieng le a vawitienga ngîr ka hmu a nih."
"And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.","Chun, LALPA chun, ‘Israel ram lal Ahab chu Ramoth-gileada chun a hang fe a, chutaka chun a hang thi theina dingin tuin am thlêm a ta?’ a ta. Chun, mi pakhat chun chuong ang chun a hril a, mi dang khawmin chuong ang bawk chun an hung hril pei a."
"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?","Chun, thlarau pakhat chu a hung suok a, LALPA hmaa chun a ngîr a, ‘Keiin hang thlêm ka tih,’ a ta. Chun, LALPA chun, ‘Iengtinam ie?’ a ta."
"And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.","Ama chun, ‘Hang fêng ka ta, a zâwlnei po pohai baua chun thlarau inkhêl hang nîng ka tih,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun, ‘Ama chu thlêm ngei i ta, hlaw khawm hang hlawtling ngei i tih; fe suok la, chuong ang tak chun hang thaw rawh,’ a ta."
"Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.","Chuleiin, tuhin ngai ta, hieng i zâwlneihai baua hin khêl hrilna thla- rau a sie tah a; chuleichun, LALPA chun i chungthua chun thil ṭha naw chu a hril tah a nih,” tiin."
"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?","Chun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chu a hung hnai a, “Keimaa inthawk- in i kuoma thu hril dingin LALPA thlarau chu khaw tieng am a fe leh?” tiin, Mikaia chu a bienga chun a ben tah a."
"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Ngai ta, pindan sûngrila inbihmang dinga i fe pha, chu ni ngei chun la hrieng i tih,” a ta."
"And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;","Chun, Israel lal chun, “Mikaia hi man unla, khawpui enkawltu Amon kuoma chun ṭhuoi nâwk ro; lal naupa Joas kuoma le chun;"
"and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.","chun, ‘Hi mipa hi lunginah sie unla, thlamuongtaka ka hung nâwk hmakhat chun rimsikna tui le rim- sikna beiin ama hi châwm ro,’ lalin a tih, ti ro,” a ta."
"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Thla- muongtaka i hung nâwk hrim hrim chun, LALPAIN kei mi hmangin thu a hril naw nîng a tih,” a ta. Chun, “Mipuihai, nangni po poin lo hre ta u,” a ta."
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.,"Chuongchun, Israel ram lal le Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu Ramoth- gileada chun an hang fe tah a."
"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.","Chun, Israel lal chun Jehosa- phat kuoma chun, “Insukdanglam ka ta, indonaah hang fêng ka tih; amiruokchu, nang chu i lal puon sil zing la,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israel lal chu ân sukdanglam a, indonaa chun an hang fe tah a."
"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.","Chun, Suria lal chun sakawr tawlailîrhai hotuhai kuoma chun, “Israel lal ngat naw chu mi lien amanih, mi chîn amani khawm chu va do naw ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.","Chun, sakawr tawlailîr hotuhai chun Jehosaphat chu an hmu chun, “Israel lal a nih a,” an ta. Chuleiin, ama chu do dingin an inhuol tah a; amiruokchu, Jehosaphat chu a khêk a, LALPA chun ama chu a ṭhangpui tah a; chuongchun, amaa inthawka inkieng dingin Pathien chun a hung thaw tah a."
"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.","Chun, sakawr tawlailîr hotuhai chun Israel lal a ni nawh ti an hmu chun, ama an hnawt lai chu an kîrsan tah a."
"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.","Chun, mi tuin amanih tum bîk nei loin a thalngul chu a kuoi a, Israel lal chu a râlthuom inzawmna kâr taka chun a kâp tah a; chuleichun, a tawlailîr khaltu kuoma chun, “Kei her la, sipaihai laia inthawk hi mi fe suokpui raw khai, ka hliem nasa êm el,” a ta."
And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.,"Chu ni chun indona chu a zuol pei a, ngai ta, Israel lal chu Suriahai chu doin a tawlailîra chun zântieng chenin a ṭhang zing a; chun, ama chu nisa tlâk hun lai taka hin a thi tah a."
And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.,Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu thlamuongtakin Jerusalema a ina chun a kîr tah a.
"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.","Chun, Hanani naupa zâwlnei Jehu chu ama tuok dingin a lo va fe suok a, lal Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Mi rilo chu ṭhangpuiin, LALPA theidatu chu i hmangai ding a ni maw?

"Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God.","Amiruokchu, nangmaa hin thil ṭha hmusuok a ni ve bawk a, hi rama inthawka Asera chu sie hmang a, Pathien chu zawng dinga i lungril chu i siem ta leiin,” a ta."
"And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chun, Jerusalema chun Jehosa- phat chu a um a; Beer-sebaa inthawk- a Ephraim tlâng ram chenin mi- puihai laia chun a fe suok a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuom tienga chun anni chu a hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk tâwl a."
"And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,","Chun, Juda khawpui kul neihai po poa khaw tinah, ram sûnga chun rorêltuhai a sie tâwl a,"
"and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and he is with you in the judgment.","rorêltuhai kuoma chun, “In thaw chu ngaituo hlak unla, mihriem ta dinga ro rêl in ni nawh a, LALPA ta ding lem a nih; chun, ama chu in rorêlnaah in kuomah a um a nih."
"Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.","Chuleiin, tuhin, LALPA ṭina chu in chungah um sienla, chu chu pawisa hle unla, thaw khawm thaw bawk ro; ei Pathien LALPAA chun khawhlona hrim a um nawh a; mi inza bîkna khawm a um nawh a, thamna lâkna khawm a um bawk nawh,” a ta."
"Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.","Chunawa khawm chun Jehosa- phat chun Jerusalema chun Levi mihai le thiempuhai le, Israel pa- hnam ṭhuoituhai chu thubuoiahai le LALPA ta dinga rorêl dingin a sie bawk a.

"And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.","Chun, anni ân fui a, “LALPA ṭi pumin, ringumtakin, lungril ṭha fam- kimin in thaw ding a nih."
"And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be guilty.","Chun, in unau an khawpuihaia chênghaia inthawka thisen le thisen inkâra manih, dân le thupêkhai in- kâra manih, thuruot le rorêlhai inkâra maniha thubuoihaiin in kuomah an hung inkhing chun, LALPA chungah an suksuol a, nangni le in unauhai chunga lunginsenna chu a hung tlung nawna dingin anni chu in kâwk ding a nih: hi hi thaw hlak unla, suksuol naw ti niu."
"And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good.","Chun, ngai ta u, thiempu lal tak Amaria chu LALPA thu chungchâng po poa chun nangni hotu a na; Juda sûngkaw chunga rorêltu Ismael naupa Zebadia chu lal thu chung- chânga po po chun a ni bawk a; Levi mihai khawm chu in hmaa chun hotuhai ni bawk an tih.

"Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA hmingin in le, ama lalram ta dingin in bâwl a lo tum tah a."
"And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun phurrik phur mi sîng sari le thing sak mi sîng riet le, anni chu enkawltu dingin mi sâng thum le za ruk chu a ruot tah a."
"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.","Chun, Solomon chun Tura lal Huram kuoma chun mi a tir a, “Ka pa David kha i lo ngaisak a, a umna dinga in bâwlna dingin sidar thinghai i lo thawn ang bawk khan, kei khawm mi hung thawn ve rawh."
"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.","Ngai ta, LALPA ka Pathien hmingin ama kuoma inhlân ding le, riminhnikhai a hmaa râwna ding le, entirna bei sie zingna ding le, zîng le zâna le, châwlnia le, thla tharhaia le, LALPA kan Pathien ruoiṭhe hun- bihaia pumrawhmang thilinhlânna dingin in ka bâwl a.

And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.,"Chu in ka bâwl chu a ropui hle a, kan Pathien chu pathien danghai po po nêkin a ropui lem hrim a."
"But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?","Amiruokchu, vân le vânhai vân khawm chun ama chu a dâwl nawh ti hmuin tuin am ama ta ding chun in bâwl thei a ta?

"Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave all manner of gravings, to be with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.","Chuleiin, tuhin rângkachak sina themthiem mi, tangkaruo le, dârsen le thîra thiem, a senêm le a senduk le, a dumpâwla thiem, ker dân kawng chi tinrênga thiem, ka pa Davidin a lo ruoi tah, Jerusalem le Juda rama mi thiemhai le thaw ding hin mi them- thiem mi hungtir pêk rawh."
"Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,","Sidar thinghai, fâr thinghai, al- gum thinghai Lebanona inthawk khan mi hung inphur bawk la; i mihai chu Lebanona thingphûr an thiem ti ka hriet si a; chun, ngai ta, i sie- hlawhai chu ka siehlawhai leh um an ta;"
even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.,"thing tamtak el mi buotsaipêk dingin, hi in ka bâwl ding hi nasataka ropui a ni ding a ni sih a."
"And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.","Chun, i mi thing âttuhai kuoma chun bupui tekhâwng sîng hni le, buṭei tekhâwng sîng hni le, hriek bath sîng hni le uoin bath sîng hni pêng ka tih,” tiin."
"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.","Tura lal Huram chun ziekin a dawn a, chu chu Solomon kuomah a thawn a, “LALPA chun a mihai a lunginsiet leiin an chunga lalah a siem che a nih,” tiin."
"Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.","Huram bawk chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien, hnuoi le vân siem- tu lal David kuoma naupasal vartak hrietthiemna le thlierthiemna nei mi, LALPA ta ding le a lal ram ta dinga in bâwltu ding petu chu inpâkin um raw se."
"And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,","Chun, tuhin hi mi themthiem, hrietthiemna nei mi, a hming Huramabi ka hung tir,"
"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.","ama chu Dan naunuhmeihai thlaa mi a na, ama pa chu Tura mi hrim, rângkachak sina le tangkaruoa le, dârsena le thîra le lunga le, thinga le, a senêma le, a dumpâwla le, puon zai inhmia le a senduka thiem a na, ker dân chi tinrênga ker ding le, thaw dân kawng ruot ang thaw ding mi thiem a na; i themthiemhai le ka pu David i pa, mi thiemhai leh ama chun sin thâwng a ta."
"Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:","Tuhin bupui le buṭei le hriek le, uoin ka puin a hril ta kha, a siehlawhai kuoma hin hung thawn sienla,"
"and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.","pawimaw ding ang zât zât chu Lebanona inthawkin thing chu hung sât kan ta, tuipuiah Joppa chen hung tawl kan ta, chutaka inthawk chun Jerusalemah nangin lâng i ta,” tiin."
"And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.","Chun, Solomon chun Israel rama mikhuol um po pohai chu a tiem a, a pa Davidin a tiem hnunghai kha, chuongchun, nuoi khat sîng nga sâng thum le za ruk an tling a."
"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.","Chun, anni laia sîng sari chu thil phur mi dingin a ruot a; chun, sîng riet chu tlânga thing sak mi dingin; chun, sâng thum le za ruk chu mipuihai sin inthawtirtu dingin."
"And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.","Hi hnunga Moab thlahai le Ammon thlahai chu, Meunim mi ṭhenkhathai le chun Jehosaphat chu do dingin an hung thaw tah a."
"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).","Chun, mi tuhai amanih an hung a, Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Suria rama tuipui râla inthawkin mipui nasatak nangma rûn ding chein an hung a, ngai ta, Hazazon-tamarah an um,” tiin an hril a, (chu chu Engedi leh angkhat a nih)."
"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.","Chuongchun, Jehosaphat chu a ṭi tah a; LALPA chu a zawng a, Juda ram po poa bunghei a rawt tah a."
"And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.","Chun, Juda mihai chu LALPA ṭhangpuina zawng dingin an in- khâwm a; Juda ram khawpui po poa inthawkin LALPA chu zawng dingin an hung tâwl a."
"And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;","Jehosaphat chu LALPA inah, tuollai thar hmaa Juda le Jerusalem mipui pungkhâwmhai laia chun a ngîr a;"
"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.","A hril a, “Aw LALPA, kan thlatu- hai Pathien, nang chu vân Pathien i ni naw am a nih?

"Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?","Aw kan Pathien, i mi Israelhai hmaah hi ram hluotuhai hi i hnawt suokin, i ruolpa Abraham thlahai kuomah kumkhuoa dingin i pêk a ni naw am a nih?"
"And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,","Chuongchun, chutaka chun an um a, i ta dingin i hmingin hmun inthieng chutaka chun an bâwlpêk che a,"
"If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee (for thy name is in this house), and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.","‘Thil ṭha naw dâm, kâwlhnâm dâm, rorêlna dâm, hri amanih, ṭâm amanih kan chungah a hung tlung chun nangma hmaa le hi in hmaa hin ngîr kan ta, (i hming chu hi ina hin a um sih a,) kan rimsiknaa chun nang hung ko kan ti cheh a, nang chun mi lo sandam i tih,’ tiin."
"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;","Tuhin, ngai ta, Ammon le Moab thlahai le Seir tlâng Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia nangin Israel mihai inrûntir lo le, insuk- siettir lo a i în umtirhai khan,"

"And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.","Chuongchun, Juda mihai po po chu LALPA hmaa chun an nauhai leh an nuhmeihai le an nautêhai rawi le chun an ngîr a."
"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly;","Chun, Asaph naupasalhai Levi mi, Mattania naupa, Jeiel naupa, Benaia naupa, Zekaria naupa, Jaha- ziel chunga chun mipui inkhâwmhai laia chun LALPA thlarau a hung tlung a;"
"and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.","ama chun a hril a, “Nangni Juda mi po pohai, Jerusalem hluotu po pohai le nang lal Jehosaphat, lo ngai ta u, LALPA chun hieng ang hin in kuomah a ti a nih, ‘Hi mipui tamtak lei hin beidawng naw unla, ṭit khawm ṭi bawk naw ro; indona chu in ta a ni nawh a, Pathien ta a ni lem sih a."
"To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.","Zînga hin anni chu zuk thaw unla, ngai ta u, Ziz lam tunga khan an hung a nih; Jeruel thlalêr tlung hmaa phairuom tâwpa khan anni chu hmûng in tih."
"Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: to-morrow go out against them; for Jehovah is with you.","Hi indonaa hin in do ngai kher naw nih, intlar phawt unla, ngîr ṭawk ṭawk ro; LALPA sandamna chu en zing el ro; aw Juda mihai le Jerusalem mihai, ṭi naw unla, beidawng bawk naw ro; zingah anni chu hang thaw unla, LALPA chu in kuomah a um sih a,’” tiin."
"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.","Chun, Jehosaphat chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a lu a kûn a, chun, Juda mi po po le Jerusalema chêngtuhai chu LALPA hmaa chun an bawkkhup a, LALPA chibai an bûk a."
"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.","Chun, Kohath thlahai le Kora thla Levi mihai chu râwl nasataka inringa Israel Pathien LALPA chu inpâk dingin an ngir tah a."
"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.","Chun, zîngkâr inhmatakin an tho a, Tekoa thlalêra chun an hang feh a, chun, chuonga an fe suok lai chun Jehosaphat chu a ngîr a, “Aw Juda le Jerusalema chêngtuhai, mi lo ngai ta u; LALPA in Pathien chu ring unla, chuongchun, sukdetin um in tih; a zâwlneihai chu ring unla, chuongchun, hlawtling in tih,” a ta."
"And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân fui zo hnung chun, sipaihai hmaa an fe suok phaa inthieng mawina chu inpâka LALPA kuoma hla sak dingin mi a ruot a: “LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ro, a zângaina chu kumkhuoin a um zing sih a, ti ro” a ta."
"And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.","Chun, an inpâk a, hla an hang sak ṭan phing chun Juda ram hung rûntuhai Seir tlâng le, Moab le Ammon thlahai chunga chun inchân rutuhai LALPA chun ân chân tir tah a; chuongchun, hnein an um tah a."
"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.","Moab le Ammon thlahai chu Seir tlâng khuo deltuhai chu that vawng a, anni sukbohmang dingin an hung tho tah a; chun, Seir tlâng hluotuhai an hung sukrêm hnunga khawm chun, mi tin chu mi dang dang insukbohmangtuo an tum seng tah a."
"And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.","Chun, Juda mihai chu thlalêra vêngna in insânga an hang tlung chun; mipuihai chu an hei en a; chun, ngai ta, mithi ruong hnuoia tluhai chu an hmu a; tukhawm a damsuok hrim an um dêr nawh a."
"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.","Chun, Jehosaphat le a mihai chu an thuom hlîppêk dinga an hung chun lunghluhai, silfênhai, hausakna nasatak elhai chu anni lai chun an hmusuok a, chuonghai chu an phur sêng lo rauin an lâk a; chuong ang lâwm chun a tam a, ni thum sûng zet chu râllâk thilhai chu an lâk a."
And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto this day.,"Chun, a ni li ni chun anni chu Beraka ruoma chun an inkhâwm a, chutaka chun LALPA chu an chawi- mawi a, chuleiin, a hmun hming chu tu chen hin “Malsâwmna ruom” ti a ni tah a."
"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.","Chun, Juda rama mi po po le Jerusalema mihai chu an kîr nâwk tah a; Jehosaphat chu anni rawi hmaa chun hlimtakin Jerusalema fe ding chun a kîr tah a; LALPA chun an hmêlmahai chunga hlim dingin anni chu a lo siem ta sih a."
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah.,"Chun, Jerusalema chun LALPA inah perkhuonghai, ṭingṭanghai, taw- tawrâwthai leh an hung lût a."
"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.","Chun, Israelhai hmêlmahai chu LALPA chun a dopui ti an hriet chun chuong ramhaia lalramhai po po chunga chun LALPA ṭina chu a um a."
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.,"Chuongchun, Jehosaphat ram huop sûng chu a re ṭawk ṭawk a; a Pathien chun a vêl po poa chun râl- muongna a pêk sih a."
And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.,"Jehosaphat chun Juda ram chunga chun ro a rêl a, a rorêl ṭan chun kum sâwmthum panga a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmhni panga a rêl a; a nu hming chu Azuba, Silhi naunu kha a nih."
"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.","A pa Asa lampui kha a hraw a, LALPA mithmua ân dik chu thawin a pêtsan ngai nawh a."
Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers.,"Amiruokchu, bâwlhmunhai chu lâk hmang a ni nawh a; mihai khawm chun an thlatuhai Pathien tienga chun an lungrilhai an lân nghat chie nawh a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.","Jehosaphat thilthaw, a hmasa le a nuhnunghai chu, ngai ta, Hanani naupa Jehu chanchin bu, Israel lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a nih."
And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:,"Chun, hi hnunga hin Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu Israel ram lal Ahazia le chun an inzawm a; ama chun khawhlotakin a thawh a;"
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.,"lawnghai siema, Tarsisa fe dingin ama chu ân zawmpui a; chuong chun, Ezion-gebera chun lawnghai chu an siem tah a."
"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.","Chun, Maresaa Dodavahu naupa Eliezer chun Jehosaphat chunga chun a hrillâwk a, “Ahazia chu în zawmpui leiin, LALPA chun i sinthawhai chu a suksiet tah,” a ta. Chuongchun, lawnghai chu an kawiseh a, Tarsisa chun an fe thei ta nawh a."
"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.",Jehosaphat chu a thlatuhai kuoma chun a in tah a; David khawpuiah a thlatuhai kuoma chun phûmin a um tah a; a naupa Jehoram chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a;
"And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.","chun, unauhai, Jehosaphat nau- pasalhai a nei a: Azaria, Jehiel, Zekaria, Azaria, Mikael, Sephatia; hienghai po po hi Israel ram lal Jehosaphat naupasalhai an nih."
"And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.","Chun, an pa chun an kuoma chun thilpêk nasatak elhai, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, thil hlutakhai dâm le Juda rama khawpui kul nei- hai leh a pêk a; amiruokchu, Jehoram chu nau lutîr a ni leiin lalram chu a pêk a."
"Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.","Chuonga Jehoram chu a pa ram chunga chun a hung inlal a, a hung insukhrât phing chun a unauhai po po le Israel rama lal tamtak chu kâwlhnâmin a that tâwl tah a."
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.,Rorêl a ṭan chun Jehoram chu kum sâwmthum pahni a na; Jerusa- lema chun kum riet sûng ro a rêl a.
"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.","Ama chun Ahab sûngkuoin an thaw ang khan, Israel ram lalhai lampuia bawk khan a feh a; Ahab naunu nuhmeiah a nei a; LALPA mithmua thil ṭha lo chu a thawh a."
"Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun David sûngkuo chu a sukbohmang nawh a, David kuoma thuthlung a lo siem ta lei le, ama le a thlahai kuoma khâwnvar pêk zing zing dinga a lo tiem ta leiin."
"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.","Ama hun laia chun Edom ram chu Judahai chunga chun an hel a, anni chunga chun lal an siem tah a."
"Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.","Chun, Jehoram chu ama le a sakawr tawlailîr po pohai le a hotuhai le chun ân thawk a, zân lai a hang ṭhâwng a, sakawr tawlailîr hotuhai le ama inhuoltu Edom mihai chu a thaw tah a."
"So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.","Chuongchun, vawisûn ni chen hin Edom mihai chu Judahai chunga chun an hel ta zing a; chu huna bawk chun Libna khuo khawm chu an lo hel veh a; a thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu a lo nghatsan tâk leiin."
"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.","Chunawa khawm chun Juda ram tlângahai chun bâwlhmunhai a siem a, Jerusalema umhai chu ân uirettir a, chuongchun, Juda ram chu an lo ṭhuoi hmang tah a."
"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,","Chun, a kuoma chun zâwlnei Elija kuoma inthawkin lekha ziek a hung a, “I pu David Pathien LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘I pa Jehosaphat lampuihai chu i hraw nawh a, Juda ram lal Asa lampuihai khawm chu i hraw bawk nawh a;"
"but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, who were better than thyself:","Israel lalhai lampuihai chu i hraw lem a. Ahab sûngkuoin an lo thaw ta angin, Jerusalema umhai le Juda rama mihai chu i lo inuirettir tah a; chun, i pahnama mi i unauhai nanga nêka ṭha lemhai chu i that bawk a,"
"behold, Jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance;","ngai ta, LALPA chun i mihai, i nauhai, i nuhmeihai le i thilnei po pohai chu hripuiin nasatakin a hrem ding a nih;"
"and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.","i phîng natna leiin nang khawma natna nasatak nei i ta; ni tin tinin, chu natna leia i rîlhai a suok zo vawng hmakhat chun nei i tih,’” tiin."
"And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians:","Chun, Ethiopia mihai kâwla um Arabia le Philistin mihai lungril chu Jehoram chunga chun LALPAIN a chawktho a;"
"and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.","Juda ram chu an hung rûn a, an hung lût a; lal ina thil hmua umhai po po an lâk vawng a; a naupasalhai le naunuhmeihai leh, chuongchun, a naupasalhai laia a naupang tak Jehoahaz ti chau naw chu a naupa- sal hrim hrim mâksanpêk a ni nawh a."
And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.,"chun, hieng thilhai po po hnunga hin LALPA chun a phîngah natna dam thei loin a hrem a."
"And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.","Chuong anga kum hni ân vawi hnung chun, a natna lei chun a rîl chu a suok a, natna natakin a thi tah a. Chun, a mihai chun a thlatuhai chawimawinaa meipui an sêm ang khan, ama ta dingin meichawk an siempêk nawh a."
"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.","Rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwm- thum pahni mi a na, Jerusalema chun kum riet ro a rêl a; ama chu ngainatna um loin a thi tah a; David khawpuia chun an phûm a, lalhai thlân ina khan ni loin."
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.,"Jerusalema chênghai chun a naupa naupang tak Ahazia chu ama aia chun lalin an siem a; Arabia mihai le pâwl ruol bûka hunghai khan a upahai po chu an that vawng ta sih a. Chuongchun, Judai ram lal Jehoram naupa Ahazia chun ro a rêl tah a."
Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.,"Ro a rêl ṭan chun Ahazia chu kum sâwmli pahni mi a na, Jerusalema chun kum khat sûng ro a rêl a, a nu hming chu Athalia, Omri naunu a nih."
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.,Ama khawma Ahab sûngkaw lampuihai kha a hraw ve a; a nu chu khawhlotaka khawsa dinga a thu rawtpuitu a ni sih a.
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.",Ahab sûngkuoin an thaw ang khan LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thaw a; a pa a thi hnung chun anni chu a sietna ding chena a thu rawtpuituhai an ni sih a.
"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.","An thu rawt ang pei chun a fe a, Suria ram lal Hazael chu do dingin Ramoth-gileada chun Israel ram lal Ahab naupa Jehoram le chun a hang fe veh a; Suria mihai chun Joram chu an lo inhliem a."
"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.","Chun, Suria ram lal Hazael a donaa Ramaa ama an inhliemnahai chu insukdam dingin Jezreela chun a kîr tah a. Chun, Judai ram lal Jeho- ram naupa Azaria chu, Ahab naupa Jehoram chu a damnaw leia Jezreela en dingin a zu feh a."
"Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.","Chuongchun, Ahazia bohmangna chu Pathiena inthawk a na, Joram kuoma a hang fe lei tak chu a nih; chuonga a hung lai chun, Ahab sûng- kuo chu sât thlatu dinga LALPAIN hriek a lo nâl tah Nimsi naupa Jehu chu do dingin Joram le khan a hang fe ve sih a."
"And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.","Chun, Jehu chun thupêk Ahab sûngkaw ta dinga a pêk suok lai chun Juda ram lalhai le Ahazia unauhai naupasalhai chu Ahazia rawngbâwl- in a hmuh a, anni chu a that tâwl tah a."
"And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.","Chun, Ahazia chu a zawng a, an man a, (Samariaa chun a lo in bihmang a na) Jehu kuoma chun an hung ṭhuoi a, an that tah a; chun, an phûm a, “A lungril po poa LALPA zawngtu Jehosaphat naupa chu a ni ngei,” an tih a. Chuongchun, Ahazia sûngkuoa chun lalram chunga rorêl thei ding mi pakhat khawm an um ta nawh a."
"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.","Chun, Ahazia nu Athalia chun a naupa chu a thi tah ti a hriet chun, a tho a, Juda sûngkuo lal chi po chu a rawt ta vawng a."
"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.","Amiruokchu, lal naunu Jehosa- beath chun Ahazia naupa Joas chu a lâk a, lal nauhai thata umhai laia inthawk chun ân rûkhmang a, khum pindanah ama dawntu le chun a sie tah a. Chuongchun, lal Jehoram nau- nu Jehosabeath, thiempu Jehoiada nuhmei chun (ama chu Ahazia farnu a ni sih a,) Athaliaa inthawk chun a thuphmang a, chuongchun, a suk- hlum ve nawh a."
And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.,"Pathien ina chun anni leh kum ruk sûng thupin a um a, chun, Athalia chun ram chunga chun ro a rêl a."
"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.","Chun, a kum sari kum chun Jehoiada chu ân sukhrât a, sipai za pâwl chunga hotuhai, Jeho- ram naupa Azaria hai, Jehohanan naupa Ismael hai, Obed naupa Azaria hai, Adaia naupa Maaseia hai, Zikri naupa Elisaphat hai le chun thu a thlung a."
"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.","Chun, Juda ram sûnga chun a fe vêl a, Juda khawpui po poa inthawk chu Levi mihai le, Israel pahnam ṭhuoituhai le chun a lâk khâwm a, Jerusalema chun an fe tah a."
"And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David.","Chun, mipui inkhâwmhai po po chun Pathien ina chun lal le thutiem an siem tah a. Chun, an kuomah a hril a, “David naupasalhai chungthu LALPAIN a hril ta angin, en ta u lal naupa hin ro a rêl ding a na."
"This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;","Hi hi thil in thaw ding chu hung nîng a tih: Châwlnia hung hlak, thiempuhai le Levi mihai hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu kawtkhâr vêngtuhai nîng in ta;"
and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.,"a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu lal inah um an ta, a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu lungphûmna dai kawtkhâr bulah um an ta; chun, mipui po po chu LALPA in inhuonna tuol sûnglaia chun um an tih."
"But let none come into the house of Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, thiempuhai ti chau naw chu mi tukhawm LALPA ina chun fe naw raw hai se; Levi mi rawngbâwltuhai le chau chun anni chu hung lût an tih, an inthieng sih a; amiruokchu, mipuihai po po chun LALPA chu an nghâk seng ding a nih."
"And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.","Levi mihai chun, mi tin an râlthuomhai chawi sengin lal chu ngîr huol an ta; amiruokchu, mi tukhawm LALPA ina hung lût chu that ni raw se; nangni chu lal a hung lût le a fe suok huna chun a kâwla chun um zing in tih,” tiin."
"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai le Juda mihai po po chun thiempu Jehoiadain thu a pêk ang tak chun an thaw tah a; mi tin chun anni mihai châwlnia fe suok dinghai le hung lût dinghai chu an ṭhuoi vêl a; thiempu Jehoiada chun a ṭîn ding pâwlhai chu ân thlengtir si nawh a."
"And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in the house of God.","Thiempu Jehoiada chun Pathien ina um, lal David ta phawthai dâm, feihai dâm, âwmphâwhai dâm chu sipai za pâwl hotuhai kuoma chun a pêk suok tâwl a."
"And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.","Mipuihai po po, mi tin el chu a râlthuom a kutah chawiin, lal sîrvêla le, in mâichâm sirvêl po poa chun, in sîr changtieng panga inthawka in sîr vawitieng panga chen chun ân umtir a."
"Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, Long live the king.","Chun, lal naupa chu an hung ṭhuoi suok a, lallukhum an inkhumtir a, thuinhriettir chu an pêk a; chuong- chun, lalah an siem tah a; chun, Jehoiada le a naupasalhai chun ama chu hriek an nâl a, “Lal hi Pathienin sandam raw se,” an tih a."
"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:","Chun, Athalia chun mipui tlân vêl ri le lal an chawimawi ri chu a hrietin, LALPA ina chun mipuihai kuoma chun a va feh tah a;"
"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!","chun, a hei en a, lûtna bula chun lal chu a sûtpui kâwla chun a ngîr a, sipai hotuhai le tawtawrâwt puhai khawm chu lal kâwla chun an um a.

Chun, Athalia chun a puonhai chu a keithlêr a, “Phierrûkna, phierrûkna,” tiin a khêk a."
"And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu Jehoiada chun sipai pâwl chunga siea um, za pâwl hotuhai chu a hung ṭhuoi suok a, an kuomah, “Sipai tlarhai kâra khan insuoktir ro; tukhawm ama zui taphawt chu kâwlhnâma that nîng an tih, thiempu chun, ‘LALPA ina chun ama chu that naw ro,’ a ti sih a,” a ta."
So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house: and they slew her there.,"Chuongchun, ama ta ding chun lampui chu an inken a, lal ina sakawr kawtkhâr lûtna tieng chun a feh a; chutaka chun an that tah a."
"And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah’s people.","Chun, Jehoiada chun ama le mipuihai po po le, lal inkâra chun LALPA mihai chu an ni ding a nih, tiin thuthlung a siem tah a."
"And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.","Chun, mipui po po chu Baal ina chun an va feh a, an suksiet a, a mâichâmhai le a limhai chu an suk- nâwi vawng a; Baal thiempu Mattan chu mâichâm hmaa chun an that tah a."
"And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.","Chun, Jehoiada chun LALPA ina sinthawnahai chu thiempu Levi mihai kuta chun a ruot tah a; chuonghai chu Mosie dâna ziek anga LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai, David thu lo pêk ta anga hlimtak le hla sak puma inhlân dinga LALPA ina Davidin a lo semdar tahai chu an nih."
"And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in.","Chun, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâra chun kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu a sieh a, mi tukhawm, ieng thila khawm inthieng nawna nei chu an lût nawna dingin."
"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.","Chun, za pâwl hotuhai, mi ṭhahai, mipui rorêltuhai le chu rama mi po pohai chu a ṭhuoi a, LALPA ina inthawk chun lal chu a hung ṭhuoi thlâk tah a; chun, dâi kawtkhâr sakhnungah hungin lal ina chun an hung a, lal chu lalram lalṭhungphaa chun an inṭhungtir tah a."
"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword.","Chuongchun, chu rama mipui- hai po po chu an hlim êm êm a, khaw- pui chu râlmuongin a um a, Athalia chu kâwlhnâmin an that tah a."
"Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.","Joas chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sari mi chau a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmli sûng ro a rêl a; a nu chu Beer-sebaa mi, a hming Zibia a nih."
And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.,Thiempu Jehoiada dam sûng po poa chun Joas chun Pathien mit- hmuah thil indikhai chu a thaw a.
And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.,Jehoiada chun nuhmei pahni ân neitir a; naupasalhai le naunu- hmeihai a nei a.
"And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.",Joas chun LALPA in chu siem ṭhat a lungril tah a.
"And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.","Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Juda ram khawpuiahai chun fe suok unla, kum tinin in Pathien in siem ṭhatna dingin Israel mihai po poa inthawk chun tangka dâwl unla; hi thil hi hung inhmaw hle dingin ngaituo ro,” a ta. Amiruokchu, Levi mihai chu an inhmaw naw hle el a."
"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?","Chun, lal chun thiempu laltak Jehoiada chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Thuthlungna puon ina dingin, Israel mipuihai le LALPA siehlaw Mosie ruot leiman chu Jerusalem le Juda rama inthawka hung la dingin ieng dinga Levi mihai hi i tir naw am a na?"
"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.","Kha nuhmei rilo Athalia naupa- salhai khan Pathien in chu an lo suksiet a; LALPA in ta dinga thilin- hlânhai po po kha Baal kuomah an lo pêk vawng ta sih a,” a ta."
"So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, lal chun thu a pêk a, thingrem an siem a, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr puoa chun an in- ṭhut a."
"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.","Chun, Jerusalema le Juda ram po poa chun, thlalêra Pathien siehlaw Mosien Israel mihai po po chunga thawbi a lo siem ta chu LALPA ta dinga hung chawi dingin thuphuong- na an siem tah a."
"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.","Chuongchun, lalhai po po le mipuihai po po chu an hlim hle a, an tangkahai an hung chawi a, thing- rema chun an dâwl zo hmakhat chun an thlâk ta zing hlak a."
"And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.","Chun, thingrem chu lal hotuhai hmaa Levi mihai chun an hung lâk po leh, tangka tamtak a um ti an hmu chun lal lekhaziektu le thiempu laltak hotu chu an hung a, thingrem chu an sukruok a, an lâk a, a hmuna bawk chun an va sie nâwk hlak a, chuong ang chun ni tin an thaw a, tangka tamtak an inkhâwl a."
"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.","Chun, chu chu LALPA in rawng- bâwlna sin thaw ang pei chun Jehoiada le lal chun an pêk suok tah a; in bâwlthiemhai le, thing sak- thiemhai LALPA in siem ṭha ding chun an ruoi a, LALPA in bâwl ṭha dinga dârsen le thîra sinthawtuhai khawm chu."
"So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.","Chuongchun, sinthawtuhai chun sin an thawh a; sin chu anni thaw zo famkim a ni tah a, Pathien in chu a ngai ang bawk chun an bâwl ṭhah a, an sukdet tah a."
"And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.","Chun, an zo pha chun, tangka danghai chu lal le Jehoiada kuoma chun an hung chawi a; chuonghai chun LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai, rawng- bâwlna le inhlânna bûr le bêlhai, haihawhai, rângkachak le tangkaraw bûr le bêlhai chu siem a na. Chun, Jehoiada dam sûng po po chun ni tin hin LALPA ina chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an inhlân zing zing hlak a."
"But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.","Nisienlakhawm, Jehoiada chu a hung upa a, a hung tar tah a, a thi tah a; a thi chun kum za le sâwmthum mi a nih."
"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.","Ama chu David khawpuiah lalhai laia chun an phûm a, Pathien le a in chunga le, Israel ram sûnga chun thil ṭha a thaw hlak leiin."
"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.","Jehoiada a thi hnung chun Juda ram lalhai chu an hung a, lal kuoma chun devânkaina an hung siem a. Chun, lal khawm chun an thu chu a lo ngai a."
"And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.","An thlatuhai Pathien LALPA in chu an nghatsan a; milimhai le Asera rawng chu an bâwl tah a; chuong- chun, hi an rîtlona lei hin Jerusalem le Juda ram chunga chun lungsenna a hung tlung tah a."
"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.","LALPA kuoma hung ṭhuoi nâwk dingin an kuoma chun zâwlneihai a tir a; anni chu an lo ngâwk a, na an lo daw nuom nawh a."
"And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you.","Chun, thiempu Jehoiada naupa Zekaria kuoma chun Pathien thlarau a hung tlung a, mipuihai chunga chun a ngîr a, an kuomah, “Pathien chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Hlawtling thei nâwna pha el dinga iengdinga LALPA thupêkhai chu in bawsiet am a na? LALPA chu in nghatsan leiin ama khawma a nghatsan cheu a ni hi,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, ama chu an phierrûk tah a, LALPA in inhuon tuolsûnga chun lal thupêkin an dêng hlum tah a."
"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.","Chuongchun, lal Joas chun ama chunga a pa Jehoiada ngilneizie kha a hriet zing ta nawh a, a naupa chu a that tah a. Chun, a thi chun, “LALPAIN hung en sienla, phuba la raw se,” a ta."
"And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.","Chun, kum tâwpa chun Suria sipaihai chun ama chu an hung rûn tah a; chuongchun, Juda ram le Jeru- salema khawm chun an hung lût a; an mi lienhai po po chu an sukbohmang vawng a, annia râllâk sum po po chu Damaska lal kuomah an inphur vawng a."
"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.","Suria sipai pâwlhai chu mi tlâwmte chau hi an hung a, ami- ruokchu, LALPA chun sipai pâwl lientak chu an kutah a pêk sih a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an nghatsan leiin. Chuongchun, Joas chunga chun hremna chu an in- tlungtir tah a."
"And when they were departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.","Chun, ama chu an mâksan chun (na inrimtakin ama chu an mâksan sih a), thiempu Jehoiada naupasalhai thisen lei khan ama siehlaw ngeiin ama chu a phierrûk tah a; a khum chunga ngei chun a that a, a thi tah a; David khawpuia chun an phûm a, nisienlakhawm, lalhai thlân ina khan chu an phûm nawh."
"And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.","Hienghai hi ama phierrutuhai chu an nih: Ammon nu Simeath naupa Zabad hai, Moab nu Simrith naupa Jehozabad hai hi."
"Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, a naupasalhai chungthu le, ama chunga phurrik nasatak innghat le, Pathien in bâwl thu chu, ngai ta, lalhai chanchin ziekna bua chun an ziek a. Chun, a naupa Amazia chun ama aiin ro a rêl tah a."
"Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.","Amazia chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmhni pakuo ro a rêl a, a nu hming chu Jehoaddan, Jerusalem mi a nih."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.","LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a; amiruokchu, lungril ṭha famkim leh ni loin."
"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.","Lalram chu ama ta dinga sukdet a ni phing chun, a pa lal thattu a siehlawhai kha a that tâwl a."
"But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.","Nisienlakhawm, an nauhai chu a that nawh a, LALPA thupêk ang a, Mosie lekhabua dâna ziek angin a thaw lem tah a; “Nauhai ta dingin pahai chu thi naw ni hai a, nauhai chu pahai ta dingin thi bawk naw ni hai; amiruokchu, mi tin mâni suolna senga ding chun thi lem an tih,” tiin."
"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.","Chunawa khawm Amazia chun Juda mihai chu a ko khâwm a, Juda le Benjamin chia mi po pohai chu za pâwl hotu hnuoia dâm, sâng pâwl hotu hnuoia dâm an pahnam ang peiin an inumtir a; kum sâwmhni le a chungtienga mi po chu a tiem a, phâw le fei hmang thei, indo dinga fe suok thei ṭhieu le thlangsuok ṭhieu mi nuoi thum an um a."
He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.,"Chun, tangka talent za khatin Israel rama inthawkin mi huoisen nuoi khat a ruoi bawk a."
"But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi a kuomah a hung a, “Aw lalpa, Israel sipaihai hi nanga ruolin fe ve naw raw hai se, Israelhai kuoma chun LALPA chu a um si nawh a; anih, Ephraim thlahai po po huomin."
"But if thou wilt go, do valiantly, be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.","Nisienlakhawm, in fe suok a ni hrim hrim chun, huoitakin thaw la, indonaa chun va hrât rawh, hmêl- mahai hmaa chun Pathien chun suktlâwm a ti che; Pathien chun ṭhangpui ding le pei thla dingin thilthawtheina a nei sih a,” a ta."
"And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.","Amazia chun Pathien mi kuoma chun, “Anleh, Israel sipaihai kuoma tangka talent za ka lo pêk ta chu ieng tin am thâwng ei ti leh?” a ta. Pathien mi chun, “Hi nêka tam khawm hi pe ding chein LALPA chu a thei a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
"Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.","Amazia chun, Ephraima in- thawka a kuoma sipai hunghai kha an in tienga fe nâwk el dingin a ṭhe thlâk tah a; chuongchun, Judahai chunga chun an lungsen chu nasa- takin a chawk tah a, lunginsen ṭium- tak chun in an inlawi nâwk tah a."
"And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.","Chun, Amazia chu ân sukhuoi a, a mihai chu a ṭhuoi suok a, Chi Ruoma chun a fe tah a; Seir thlahai sîng khat rau chu a hang hne tah a."
"And other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they were all broken in pieces.","Chun, mi dang sîng khat bawk chu Juda thlahai chun a hringin an ṭhuoi a, lungpui sîpa chun an hung ṭhuoi a, chuongchun, lungpui sîpa inthawk chun an pei thlâk a, an rêng chun an inphit vawng tâwl tah a."
"But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.","Chun, sipai pâwla mihai chu, indo dinga ama le fe lo dinga Amazia chun a tirkirhai khan Samaria inthawk Beth-horon chenin Juda ram khawpuihai chu an hang rûn a, mi sâng thum an that a, râllâk sum tamtak an lâk bawk a."
"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.","Chun, Amazia chu Edom mihai that a hung kîr hnung chun, Seir thlahai pathien chu a hung lâk a, a pathienhai ni dingin a sieh a, an hmaa chun a kûn a, an kuoma chun riminhnikhai a raw tah a."
"Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?","Chuleichun, LALPA lunginsen chu Amazia chunga chun a hung ṭal tah a, a kuoma chun zâwlnei a tir a, a kuomah, “I kuta inthawka an mihai ngei khawm sanhim thei si lo, mipuihai pathienhai chu iengdinga i zawng am a na?” a tih a."
"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Have we made thee of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.","Chun, ama le an inbiek zing lai chun lal chun a kuomah, “Lal thurawnpuituah kan siem che am a nih? Fîmkhur rawh; iengdingin am thatin um i ta?” a ta. Chuongchun, zâwlnei chun, “Ka thurâwn chu i pawisa nawh a, hi thil hi i thaw leiin, Pathien chun suksiet a tum che a nih ti ka hriet a nih,” a ta, a to tah a."
"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.","Chun, Juda ram lal Amazia chun thurawn a lâk a, Israel lal Jehu naupa Jehoahaz naupa Joas kuomah mi a tir a, “Hung ta, hmai le hmaisan ngeiah hang inen ei tih,” tiin."
"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.","Chun, Israel ram lal Joas chun Juda ram lal Amazia kuoma chun mi a tir a, “Lebanona hlingbukin Leba- nona Sidar thing kâwlah mi tirin, ‘I naunu kha ka naupa nuhmei dingin pe rawh,’ tiin; chun, Lebanona ram- sahai chu an hung a, hlingbuk chu an chîl thlûk tah a."
"Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?","A ni luo, ‘Edom chu ka hang hneh a’ i ta, i lungrilin uong dingin a dawm sâng che a ni hi; i inah um ṭawk ṭawk el rawh, i sietna ding chu chawksuok ṭâl dîm nîng a ti; nang tlûng i ta, nang ngei chu, chun nang le chun Juda ram chu tlu bawk a tih,” a ta."
"But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.","Amiruokchu, Amazia chun a ngai chuong nawh a, an hmêlmahai kuta a pêk theina dinga Pathien ithaw a nih, Edom pathienhai an lo zawng ta lei khan."
"So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.","Chuongchun, Israel ram lal Joas chu a hang feh a; Juda rama Beth-semesa chun ama le Juda ram lal Amazia chu hmaisan ngeia chun an inen tah a."
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.,Israel hmaa chun Juda chan chu a se nâwkzuol tah a; mi tin chu mâni puon ina seng an tlânse tah a.
"And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.","Chun, Israel ram lal Joas chun Jehoahaz naupa Joas naupa Juda ram lal Amazia chu Beth-semesa chun a man a, Jerusalema chun a hung ṭhuoi a, Ephraim tienga dâi kawtkhâra inthawka a kia dâi kawtkhâr chen, tawng za li zet Jerusalem kul chu a vuok chim a."
"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.","Chun, Obed-edom le Pathien ina rângkachak le tangkaruo le bûr le bêlhai po po, lal ina ro thilhluhai le, hrên ding salhai le chun a lâk a, Samaria chun a kîr tah a."
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.,"Chun, Israel lal Jehoahaz nau- pa Joas thi hnung chun Juda lal Joas naupa Amazia chu kum sâwmpanga a la dam a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?","Chun, Amazia thilthaw dang- hai, a hmasa le nuhnunghai khawm chu, ngai ta, Israel le Juda lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
"Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.","Chun, Amazia chu LALPA zuinaa inthawka ân herhmang china khan chu Jerusalema chun ama chunga phierrûkna an siem a, Lakis tieng chen a tlânseh a, amiruokchu, Lakis tieng chun mi an tir pei a, chutaka chun an that tah a."
"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.","Chun, a ruong chu sakawr chungah an hung lâk a, a thlatuhai laiah David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a."
"And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.","Chun, Juda mihai po po chun Uzzia chu an ṭhuoi a, ama chu kum sâwm paruka upa a na, a pa Amazia hmuna chun lalah an siem tah a."
"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.","Eloth chu a bâwl a, Juda rama chun a pêk nâwk a; chu hnunga chun lal chu a thlatuhai lai chun a in ve tah a."
"Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.","Uzzia chun ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmparuka upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmnga pahni sûng ro a rêl a, a nu hming khawm Jerusalema mi Jekolia a nih."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.",Ama khawm chun a pa Amazia lo thaw ta ang tak khan LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a.
"And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.","Pathiena thil hmulâwk hriet- thiemna nei Zekaria dam sûng po chun Pathien chu zawng dingin ân siem a; LALPA chu a zawng sûng po chu, Pathien chun ân hlawtlingtir bawk a."
"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.","Chun, a fe suok a, Philistin mihai ân dopui a; Gath kul le, Jabne kul le Asdod kul chu a suk- siet a; chun, Philistin mihai laia le Asdod biela chun khuohai a siem bawk a."
"And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.","Chun, Philistin mihai le Arabia mihai Gur-baal le Meunima umhai laia chun Pathien chun a ṭhangpui a."
And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong.,"Chuongchun, Ammon mihai chun Uzzia kuomah sie an hung chawi a, a hming chu Aigupta ram lûtna chen rauin a hung inthang tah a; a hung hrât êm êm el ta sih a."
"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.","Chunawa khawm, Uzzia chun a Kil dâi Kawtkhâr bula dâm, Ruom dâi Kawtkhâra dâm, chun, kul hung kâwina hmuna dâm khan vêngna in insânghai a bâwl a, sipaihai a sie sip a."
"And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: and he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.","Thlalêra dâm khawm vêngna in insânghai a bâwl a, tuisunsuohai tamtak a cho bawk a, ran ruol tamtak a nei sih a, tlângṭhuta le phaizâwla dâm khawm chun; lo hmun ṭhahai le tlâng rama dâm chun huon puhai le grêp hrui enkawltuhai a nei a, huon siem vêl hi a châk zâwngtak a ni sih a."
"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.","Chunawa khawm Uzzia chun indo mi, sipai pâwl, Hanania kut hnuoi, hotu Maaseia le lekhaziektu Jeielin anni tiema an nizât ang peia, a pâwl peia indoa fe suok hlakhai chu a nei bawk a."
"The whole number of the heads of fathers’ houses, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.","Pahnamhai laia ṭhuoituhai, mi hrât khawkhênghai an rênga an nizât chu sâng hni le za ruk an nih."
"And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.","Anni kut hnuoi a chun sipai inchûkthiem sa, hmêlma chunga lal chu ṭhangpui dinga, thilthawtheina nasatak le va do thei mihai chu nuoi thum, sâng sari le za nga an nih."
"And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.","Chun, Uzzia chun an ta dingin, sipai po pohai ta ding chun, phâwhai, feihai, thîr lukhumhai, indona zakuo- hai, thalngulhai, dêngvira dinga lunghai leh a siemrêl vawng a."
"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.","Jerusalema chun mi them- thiemhai hmusuokin, khâwl lihai, vêngna in insânghaia um ding le, a kia vêngna in insânga ding chun, lunghai le thalhai chu kâp thei dingin, a siem bawk a. Chuongchun, a hming chu nasatakin ân dar a, a suksuol hma po khan chu maktaka ṭhangpuiin a um sih a."
"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.","Nisienlakhawm, a hung hrât chun, a lungril a hung uong a, khawhlotakin a thaw tah a, a Pathien LALPA chunga chun a bawsiet tah a; riminhnik rawna mâichâm chunga riminhnik raw dingin LALPA biek ina chun a fe ve ta a."
"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:","Ama hnunga chun thiempu Azaria chu, LALPA thiempu sâwm- riet, mi thil thawtheitak takhai le chun a va lût veh a;"
"and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.","lal Uzzia chu an sawisêl a, a kuoma chun, “Uzzia, LALPA kuoma riminhnik raw hi nanga chan a ni nawh a, Aron naupasalhai thiem- puhai, riminhnik raw dinga suk- thienga umhai chan a ni lem; hmun inthienga inthawk hin fe suok rawh; i bawsiet a ni ta sih a; LALPA Pathiena inthawka inza i kaina khawm ni chuong bawk naw nih,” an ta."
"Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.","Uzzia chu a lunginsen a; rimin- hnik chu raw dingin riminhnik râwna mei lâkna chu a kuta chun a um zing a; chun, thiempuhai chunga a lungin- sen lai chun, riminhnik râwna mâichâm sîra, LALPA ina thiempu- hai hmaa chun a bâwka hin inphârna hri a hung suok tah a."
"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.","Chun, thiempu laltak Azaria le thiempu danghai po po chun ama chu an en zing a, chun, ngai ta, a bâwka chun a hung inphâr tah a, chutaka inthawk chun inrangtakin an hnawt- suok tah a; anih, LALPA chun ama chu a hrem tâk lei chun ama ngei khawm chun fe suok chu ân hmaw tah a."
"And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.","Chuongchun, lal Uzzia chu a thi ni chen chun inphâr a ni tah a; in hranah a um a, inphâr a na; LALPA ina inthawk chun sât thlâk a ni ta sih a; a naupa Jotham chu lal in enkawl- tu, ram sûnga mipuihai rorêltu a hung ni tah a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.","Chun, Uzzia thilthaw, a hmasa le a nuhnunghai khawm Amoz naupa Zâwlnei Isai chun a ziek a."
"So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Uzzia chu a thla- tuhai laia chun a in tah a; inphûmna thlân muol lalhai taa chun a thla- tuhai lai chun an phûm tah a, “Inphâr a ni annâwm,” an ti sih a; chun, a naupa Jotham chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.,"Jotham chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpa- ruk sûng ro a rêl a, a nu hming chu Jerusa, Zadok naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did yet corruptly.","A pa Uzziain a lo thaw ta po po ang tak khan, LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a; amiruokchu, LALPA biekina chun a lût ve nawh a. Mipuihai chun khawhlotakin thil an thawh a."
"He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.","LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr sak- hnung lem kha a siem a, Ophel kula chun in tamtak a siem bawk a."
"Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.",Chunawa khawm Juda tlâng rama chun khawpuihai a bâwl a; ramhnuoiahai khawm chun kul- bînghai le vêngna inhai dâm a bâwl bawk a.
"He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third.","Ammon thlahai chu ân dopui a, anni a hne tah a.

"So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.","Chuongchun, Jotham chu thil a hung thaw thei êm êm a, a lampuihai a Pathien LALPA chu ân kawltir hlak leiin."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.","Chuongchun, Jotham thil thaw danghai, ân donahai po po, a lam- puihai po po, ngai ta, Juda le Israel lalhai lekhabua chun ziek an nih."
"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.",Rorêl a ṭan chun ama chu kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a na; kum sâwmparuk Jerusalemah ro a rêl a.
"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Jotham chu a thlatuhai lai chun a in tah a; ama chu David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; a naupa Ahaz chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;",Ahaz chun ro a rêl ṭanin kum sâwmhnia upa a na; Jerusa- lema chun kum sâwmparuk sûng ro a rêl a; a thlatu David ang khan LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thaw ve nawh a;
"but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.","amiruokchu, Israel lalhai lampui chu a hrawh a, Baal ta ding chun milim a sunga sunghai chu a siem bawk a."
"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.",Chunawa khawm chun Hinnom naupa ruoma chun riminhnik a rawh a; Israel thlahai hmaa LALPAIN a hnawtsuok khawhri be mihai tirdak- umna ang tak chun a nauhai chu meiah ân lûttir bawk a.
"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.","Thing hring tin hnuoia le muol haia le, bâwlhmunhaia chun rimin- hnik a rawh a, ân thâwi bawk a."
"Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.","Chuleichun, LALPA a Pathien chun Suria lal kuta chun ama chu a pêk tah a, ama chu an hung thawh a, a mi tamtakhai chu salah an ṭhuoi a, Damaskaa chun an hung ṭhuoi tâwl tah a.

"For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Remalia naupa Peka chun Judai ramah, mi hrât khawkhêng ṭhieu nuoi khat le sîng hni ni khat sûngin a that a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an nghatsan leiin."
"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.","Chun, Ephraima mi thil thaw- theitak Zikri chun lal naupa Maaseia le insûng rorêltu Azrikam le lal dawttu Elkana chu a that bawk a."
"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.","Chun, Israel thlahai chun an unauhai chu sal nuoi hni, nuhmei le naunuhmeihai le naupasalhai leh an ṭhuoi hmang a; chun, râllâk sum tamtak an lâk bawk a; chu râllâk sum chu Samariaa chun an hung lâk a."
"But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up unto heaven.","Amiruokchu, LALPA zâwlnei chutaka chun a lo um a, a hming chu Oded a nih; ama chu sipai ruol Samariaa hung lût dinghai chu tuok dingin a feh a, an kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu Juda ram chunga chun a lunginsen leiin anni chu an kutah a pêk tah a, chun, anni chu lunginsenin in that a, chu chu vânah a hang tlung tah a nih."
And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?,"Tuhin Juda thlahai le Jerusa- lema mihai chu suoknuhai, suokpa- haia siem in lungril a na; amiruokchu, in Pathien LALPA chunga nangni ngei bawsietna chu nangnia ngei khawm hin a um ve a ni naw am a nih?"
"Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.","Chuleiin, tuhin mi lo ngai unla, in unauhai ngei sala in hung ṭhuoi- hai, salhai chu tirkîr nâwk vawng ro, LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumtak chu in chungah a um sih a,” a ta."
"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,","Chun, Ephraim thlahai laia ṭhuoitu ṭhenkhathai, Johanan naupa Azaria hai, Mesillemoth naupa Berekia hai, Sallum naupa Jehizkia hai, Hadlai naupa Amasa hai chun indonaa inthawka hunghai chu an lo dang a,"
"and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.","an kuoma chun, “Hitaka hin salhai chu in hung ṭhuoi ding a ni nawh: ei bawsietna le ei suolnahai belsa dingin, LALPA chungah baw- sietna mîn tluntir in tum a ni hi; ei bawsietnahai chu a nasa êm êm a, Israel chunga hin lunginsenna ṭium- tak chu a um a nih,” an lo tih a."
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.,"Chuongchun, inrâlthuomhai chun salhai le râllâk sumhai chu hotuhai hmaa le mipui inkhâwmhai hmaa chun an mâksan tah a."
"And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.","Chun, khieng an hming hrila umhai khi an tho a, salhai chu an ṭhuoi a, râllâk thilhai chu anni laia saruoka umhai chu an insiltir a, anni chu an inthuom a, kekawk an inbun- tir a, fâk ding le dâwn ding an pêk a, hriek an nâl a, anni laia hrât nawhai po po chu sabengtung chungah an inchuongtir a, an unauhai kuomah, intûm khawpui Jerikoa chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a; chun, chutaka inthawk chun Samariaa chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.,Chuong hun laia chun lal Ahaz chun Assuria lal chu ama ṭhangpui dinga fiel dingin mi a tir a.
"For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.","Edom mihai chu an hung nâwk a, Juda ram chu an hung rûn a, salah an ṭhuoi tâwl sih a."
"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there.","Philistin mihai khawma Juda ram Simtienga phaia khawpuihai chu an hung rûn a, Beth-semes hai, Aijalon hai, Gederoth hai, Soko hai an khawperhai leh, Timna le a khaw- perhai leh, Gimzo le a khawperhai leh an lâk a, chuongahai chun an um a."
"For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.","Israel lal Ahaz leiin, LALPAIN Judahai chu a hung suktlâwm a; ama chu Judahai chunga nuomtâwka a khawsak lei le LALPA chunga a bawsiet nasa êm leiin."
"And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.","Assuria lal Tiglath-pileser chu a kuomah a hung a, ama chu sukdet nêkin a sukrimsi hle a."
"For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.","Ahaz chun LALPA ina chanvo le, lal nauhai in le lal ina mi chu a lâk suok a, Assuria lal chu a lo pêk a; nisienlakhawm, a ṭhangkaipui chuong nawh a."
"And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.","Chuongchun, hi lal Ahaz hi, a lunginzîng hun laia khawm chun LALPA chungah a bawsiet zuol det pei a."
"For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.","Damaska mihai, ama hung rûntuhai pathienhai chu a biek a, ama chun, “Suria lalhai pathien- haiin anni a ṭhangpui leiin, kei khawm an mi ṭhangpui theina dingin an kuomah inthâwi ka tih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama sietna le Israel ram sûng po po sietna a ni lem tah a."
"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.","Chun, Ahaz chun Pathien ina bûr le bêlhai chu a lâk khâwm a, Pathien ina bûr le bêlhai chu a vuok- nawi vawng a; LALPA in kawtkhâr- hai chu a khâr vawng tah a; chun, Jerusalem kil tina chun ama ta dingin mâichâm a siem a."
"And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.","Chun, Juda khawpui hmun tam- taka chun Pathien danghai kuoma riminhnik rawna dingin bâwlhmun- hai a siem a, a thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu a chawk lungsen ta deu deu a."
"Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","A thilthaw danghai chu, a nung- chang tinrênghai leh, a hmasa le nuhnung khawm chu, ngai ta, Juda le Israel lalhai lekhabua chun ziek an nih."
"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Ahaz chu a thlatuhai laia chun a in tah a, khawpuiah, Jerusa- lema chun an phûm tah a; Israel lalhai thlân ina chun an sie nawh a; chun, a naupa Hezekia chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
"Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.","Hezekia chu kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a niin ro a rêl ṭan a; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmhni pakuo sûng ro a rêl a; a nu hming chu Abija, Zekaria naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.","A thlatu Davidin a thaw ta ang po po khan, ama khawmin LALPA mit- hmua thil indik chu a thawh a."
"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.","A rorêl a kum khatna, a thla khatnaa chun LALPA in chu kawt- khârhai a hawng a, a siem ṭha tah a."
"And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,","Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu a hung lâklût a, saktieng panga hmun âwla chun anni chu a ko khâwm a,"
"and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.","an kuomah a hril a, “Mi lo ngai ta u, nangni Levi mihai; tuhin nangni le nangni insukthieng unla, in thlatu- hai Pathien LALPA in chu sukthieng unla, hmun inthienga inthawka tirdakumna chu la suok ro."
"For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.","Ei thlatuhai khan an lo bawsiet a, LALPA ei Pathien mithmuah thil suol chu an lo thaw ta sih a; an ngha hmang a; LALPA umna hmuna in- thawk chun an ngha hmang a, an hnung an innghat tah a."
"Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.","Chun, tuolpûk kawtkhârhai chu an khâr a, khâwnvarhai chu an her- hlum tah a, riminhnik khawm an raw ta nawh a, Israel Pathien kuoma chun hmun inthiengah pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhai khawm chu an inhlân ta bawk nawh a."
"Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.","Chuleiin, LALPA lunginsenna chu Jerusalem le Judahai chunga chun a um a, in mita in hmu ang hin, inhîpna ding le, makti ding le, inzak dingin a siem tah a."
"For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.","Ngai ta u, ei thlatuhai chu kâwl- hnâma suktlâwm an ni tah a, ei naupasalhai, ei naunuhmeihai le ei nuhmeihai chu hi lei hin salah an um tah a."
"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.","Tuhin, einia inthawka a lungin- senna ṭiumtak chu lâk hmang a ni theina dingin Israel Pathien LALPA le chun thuthlung siem ka lungril a nih."
"My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.","Ka naupasalhai, tuhin ngaitha naw ro; riminhnikhai rawh a, a rawngbâwltuhai nia, ama rawngbâwl ding le, a hmaa ngîr dingin LALPA chun a thlang ta si cheu a,” tiin."
"Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;","Chun, Levi mihai chu an tho tah a; Kohath naupasalhai chu: Amasai naupa Mahath le Azaria naupa Joel; Merari naupasalhai chu: Abdi naupa Kis le Jehalelel naupa Azaria; Gerson mi chu: Zimma naupa Joa le Joa naupa Eden;"

"And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.","Chun, an unauhai chu an ko khâwm a, anni chu an insukthieng a, LALPA in chu sukfai dingin LALPA thuin lal thupêk ang tak chun an lût tah a."
"And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.","Chun, thiempuhai chu LALPA in sûngril lema chun sukfai ding chun an va lût a, LALPA biek in sûnga thil inthiengnaw an hmu po pohai chu LALPA in inhuonna tuol laia chun an hung lâk suok vawng a.

"Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.","Chuong chun, thla khatna ni khatnaa chun inhlân thieng chu an ṭan a, chu thla ni riet ni chun LALPA tuolpûka chun an hung tlung a; chuongchun, LALPA in po po chu ni riet sûng chun an inhlân thieng a; thla hmasatak ni sâwmparuk ni chun an zo tah a."
"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.","Chun, lal inah lal Hezekia kuoma chun an hung a, “LALPA in po po, pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm le chutaka a bûr le bêlhai po po leh, entirna bei siena dawkân le chutaka a bûr le bêlhai po po leh, kan sukthieng vawng tah a."
"Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.","Chunawa chun, bûr le bêl po po, Ahaz rorêl laia a bawsiet laia a dêhâwn po pohai kha kan buotsai a, kan inhlân thieng ta bawk a; ngai ta, tuhin LALPA mâichâm hmaa chun an um a nih,” an ta."
"Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal Hezekia chu in- hmatakin a tho vak a, khuoa hotuhai chu a ko khâwm a; LALPA ina chun a hang fe tah a."
"And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.","Chun, bâwngchal pasari, be- râmchal pasari, berâmte pasari le, kêlchal pasari Juda mihai le hmun inthieng le ram ta dinga suol thilin- hlân dingin an hung lâk a.

"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.","Chuongchun, bâwngchalhai chu an hang that a, thiempuhai chun a thisen chu an indawh a; mâichâm chunga chun an theh a; berâmchal khawm chu an that a, a thisen chu mâichâm chunga chun an theh a; berâmtehai khawm chu an that a, a thisen chu mâichâm chunga chun an theh a."
And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:,"Chun, lal le mipuihai hmaa chun suol thilinhlâna dingin kêlchal- hai chu an hung lâk hnai a; an kuthai chu an chunga chun an in nghat a;"
"and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.","thiempuhai chun an that a, an thisen chun mâichâm chunga chun suol thilinhlân chu an inhlân tah a, Israel mi po po ta dinga intlanna siempêk dingin pumrawhmang thil- inhlân le suol thilinhlân chu Israel mi po po ta dinga thaw ding a nih tiin lal chun thu a lo pêk ta sih a."
"And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.","Chun, zâwlnei Nathan hai, lal zâwlnei Gad hai le David thupêk ang tak khan Levi mihai chu LALPA ina chun dârbenthekhai leh, perkhuong- hai leh, ṭingṭanghai leh ân umtir a; thupêkhai chu a zâwlneihai hmanga LALPA pêk a ni sih a."
"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.","Chun, Levi mihai chu David thil rimawi siemhai le chun an ngîr a, thiempuhai chu tawtawrâwthai leh."
"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.","Chun, Hezekia chun pumraw- hmang thilinhlân chu mâichâm chunga chun inhlân dingin thu a pêk a. Chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu ṭan a ni ruol chun, LALPA hlahai, tawtawrâwthai, Israel lal David thil rimawi siemhai le chun ṭan an ni ve vawng tah a."
"And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished.","Chun, mipui po po chun Pathien chibai an bûk a, hlasaktuhaiin an sak a, tawtawrâwt puhai chun an mût a; chuong po po chu pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu zo a ni hmakhat chu thaw zing a na."
"And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.","Thilinhlân chu an suktâwp chun lal le a kâwla mihai po po chu an kûn a, chibai an bûk a."
"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.","Chu nawa khawm lal Hezekia le hotuhai chun Levi mihai chu Zâwlnei Asaph le David hla phuok chun LALPA inpâkna chu sak dingin thu an pêk bawk a. Chun, lâwmtakin inpâkna hla chu an sak a, an luhai an kûn a, chibai an bûk a."
"Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt-offerings.","Chun, Hezekia chun a dawn a, “Tuhin chu LALPA kuoma chun in inpêk tah a, hung hnai unla, lâwmna thilinhlânhai le inthâwinahai chu LALPA ina chun hung inhlân ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, mipuihai le inthâwi- nahai chu an hung inhlân a; chun, mi a nuom zât zât chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân khawm chu an hung lâk bawk a."
"And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.","Mipuiin pumrawhmang thilin- hlân an hung lâk zât chu bâwngchal sâwmsari, berâmchal za khat, berâmte za hni an na; hienghai po po hi LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilinhlân dinga pêk an nih."
And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.,"Chun, thil a pêka pumpêk chu bâwngchal za ruk le berâm sâng thum an nih."
"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.","Nisienlakhawm, thiempuhai chu an tlâwm leiin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai po po chu an inhlip hman nawh a, chuleiin, an unau Levi mihai chun sin chu zo fel a ni vawng chenin, anni thiempuhai an inthien chen chu an ṭhangpui tâwl a. (Levi mihai chu thiempuhai nêk chun inthien dingin lungrila chun an khermei lem sih a.)"
"And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.","Pumrawhmang thilinhlân tam tâwktak bâka chun inremna thilin- hlân thâuhai le pumrawhmang thilinhlân poa dâwnmi thilinhlânhai an um bawk a. Chuongchun, LALPA ina rawngbâwlna chu ân dawt peia siem fel chu a ni tah a."
"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.","Chun, chuong mipuihai ta dinga Pathienin thil a buotsai ta leiin Hezekia le mipuihai khawm chu an hlim tah a; chuong thil chu inhmaw thuta thaw a ni sih a."
"Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where Jehovah appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Chun, Solomon chun Moria tlânga a pa David kuoma LALPA chu ân lâr a, Davidin a lo buotsaina hmun, Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla a lo thlangna hmun Jerusalema chun LALPA in bâwl chu a ṭan tah a."
"And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.","A rorêl a kum lina, a thla hnina, a ni hninaa chun a bâwl ṭan a."
"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.","Pathien in bâwlna dinga Solo- monin a lungphûm a phûmhai chu hienghai hi an nih: a dungtieng chu tawnga inkhiin inkhina hmasa dâna chun tawng sâwmruk a na, a khang- tieng chu tawng sâwmhni a nih."
"And the porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.","Chun, a tuolpûk inpui hmaa mi chu, a dung chu a in khangtieng chen chie, tawng sâwmhni a na, ân sâng- tieng chu tawng za le sâwmhni a na, a sûng chu rângkachak inthiengin ân luon khum a."
"And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.","A in lien lem chu fâr thingin ân khum a, rângkachak inthiengin ân luon khum a, a chunga chun intûm thinghai le khaidiet limhai a siem a."
And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.,"Mawina dingin in chu lunghlu- haiin a cheimawi a, a rângkachakhai khawm chu Parvaim rângkachak an nih."
"He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.","Chutaka a kawtkhârhai, chutaka banghai le kalhai le ṭuong le chu in chu rângkachakin ân luon khum bawk a; bangahai chun cherub limhai a ker bawk a."
"And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.","Chun, hmun inthieng tak chu a siem bawk a; chu a dungtieng chu a inpui khangtieng ang chiein, tawng sâwmhni a na; a khang khawm chu tawng sâwmhni bawk a nih; chun, rângkachak inthieng talent za ruk laiin ân luon khum bawk a."
And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.,"Chun, a kilna rikzie chu râng- kachak shekel sâwmnga tluk a nih. A pindan chunghnunghai chu rângka- chakin ân luon khum a."
And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.,In inthiengtaka chun cherub pa- hni a lima cherin a siem a; chuonghai chu rângkachakin ân luon khum a.
"And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.","Cherubhai thla chu tawng sâwmhnia sei a na; cherub pakhat thla chu, a in bang va sukin tawng nga a na, a thla khing tieng chu tawng nga bawk a na; cherub dang thla kha a va suk a."
"And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.","Chun, cherub pakhat dang thla khawm chu bang va tâwkin tawng nga a na, a thla dang pakhat chun cherub thla dang kha va zawmin tawng nga a ni ve bawk a."
"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.","Chuongchun, hieng cherub thlahai hin tawng sâwmhni chu an zârhlie a; an kehaiin an ngîr a; an hmaihai chu insûng tieng chu an nghah a."
"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.","Chun, puonzâr dumpâwl le a senêm le, a senduk le puon zai inhmi a siem a, a chunga chun cherubhai ân chuon bawk a."
"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.","Chun, in hmatienga chun sût- pui pahni tawng sâwmthum pangaa insâng ve ve a siem a, chuong a lêr- tâwpa a hmawrbâwkhai chu tawng nga ve ve an ni bawk a."
"And he made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.","Chun, hmun inthienga chun khaidiethai a siem a, chuong sût- puihai lêra chun a thlung a; chun, theibufai za khat a siem bawk a, chuong chu khaidieta chun a khai tâwl a."
"And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.","Biekin tuola chun chuong sût- puihai chu a phun a, pakhat chu changtieng, a dang chu vawitieng; chun, chu changtienga mi chu a hmingah Jakin ân bûk a, vawitienga mi chu a hmingah Boaz ân bûk bawk a."
"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Hezekia chun Israel Pathien LALPA fekân ruoiṭhe chu hmang dingin Jerusalema LALPA ina chun in hung ding a nih tiin Israel le Juda mihai po po kuomah mi a tir a, chun, Manasse le Ephraim mihai kuoma khawm lekha a ziek bawk a."
"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.","Chun, thla hninaa fekân ruoiṭhe chu nei dingin Lal le a miṭhahai le Jerusalema mipui inkhâwmhai po po le chun an rawt a."
"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.","A hun pângngaia chun nei khawm an nei thei naw hrim a, thiempuhai chu a tam huntâwkin an inthien thei nawh; mipuihai chu Jerusalema chun an hung khâwm bawk naw leiin."
And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.,"Chun, chu thil chu lal le mipuihai ngaia chun ân dik a."
"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.","Chuongchun, Israel Pathien LALPA fekân ruoiṭhe chu hmang dingin Jerusalemah an hung ding a nih tiin, Israel ram po po Beer-sebaa inthawka Dan chenin thupuong siem dingin thupêk ân suoh a; ziek a ni angin, chuong anga tam chun an la hmang ngai si nawh a."
"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.","Chuongchun, dâkpuhai chu lal thupêk ang takin lal le a hotuhaia inthawk chun lekhahai chawiin Juda le Israel ram sûng po poa chun an fe tah a; “Nangni Israel thlahai, nangni Assuria lalhai kuta inthawk a suokdawkhai a la um sun- hai tieng hi a hung ngha kîr theina dingin, Israel le, Isaak le Abraham Pathien, LALPA tieng chu hung ngha nâwk ro."
"And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.","Nangni chu in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chunga bawsetu inthlatuhai le in unauhai ang kha chu ni naw unla, chuong lei chun sietnaah anni chu a pêk suok tah a ni kha in hmuh a."
"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.","In thlatuhai an ni angin mi kâwmâwhai ni naw unla; nangni chu LALPA kuomah inpe lem ro; kum- khuoa dinga sukthieng tah, a hmun inthienga chun lût unla, nangnia inthawka a lungsenna ṭiumtak chu ân kieng theina dingin LALPA in Pathien rawng chu bâwl ro."
"For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.","LALPA kuom tieng in nghakîr nâwk chun, in unauhai le in thlahaiin sala ṭhuoituhai hmaa chun lungin- sietna dawng an ta, hi rama hin hung nâwk an tih, ama kuomah in kîr phawt chun LALPA in Pathien ngilneitak le zângai theitak a na, nghatsan naw ni cheu,” tiin."
"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.","Chun, dâkpuhai chu khaw tina Ephraim le Manasse ram sûng po po Zebulun chenin an fe pei a; amiruok- chu, hmusitin an lo nuisan a, an lo nuiêu a."
"Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.","Nisienlakhawm, Aser le Manas- se le Zebulun hnama mi ṭhenkhat chu an insukhnuoi a, Jerusalema chun an hung a."
"Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah.","Chun, Juda rama khawm chun LALPA thua hotuhai le lal thupêk ang chu thaw dingin inthuruolna Pathienin a pêk a."
"And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.","Chun, a thla hninaa chun, mi- pui nasatak el chu, chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu hmang dingin Jerusalema chun an inkhâwm tah a."
"And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.","Chun, an tho a, Jerusalema mâichâm umhai le, riminhnik râwna mâichâmhai po po chu an lâk a, Kidron vadungtêa chun an pei tah a."
"Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.","Chun, a thla hnina ni sâwm- palinaa chun fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu an that a; thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu an inzak a, anni chu an inhlân thieng a. LALPA ina chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu an hung lâk lût tah a."
"And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.",Pathien mi Mosie dân ang peiin an indawtzie ang peiin an hmuna chun an ngîr a; thiempuhai chun thisen Levi mihai kuta inthawka an hmuhai chu an theh a.
"For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.","Mipui inkhâwmna laia chun mâni insukthieng lo mi tamtak chu an um sih a; chuleiin, Levi mihai chun, LALPA kuoma anni chu in- hlânthieng dingin ân thieng nawhai taphawt fekân ruoiṭhena ding an thatpêk a."
"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one","Mipui tamtak elhai, Ephraim le Manasse le Issakar le Zebulun mi tamtak elhai chu insukthieng lo an na, ziek a ni ang tho khan fekân ruoiṭhe chu an fâk a. Hezekia chun a lo ṭawngṭai pêk tah a, “LALPA ṭha chun ngaidam raw se, tukhawm"
"that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.","hmun inthieng inthien dân anga, thieng lo khawm ni sienla, Pathien, a thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu zawng dinga a lungril a lo innghat ta phawt chu,” tiin."
"And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Hezekia ṭawngṭaina chu a lo ngai a, mipuihai khawm chu a lo sukdam tah a."
"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, singing with loud instruments unto Jehovah.","Chun, Israel thlahai Jerusalem- a umhai chun chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu ni sari sûng lâwmtakin an hmang tah a, chun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu ni tin tinin LALPA kuoma thil sutrîktheihaia hlasakin LALPA chu an inpâk a."
"And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding in the service of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","LALPA rawngbâwlna sina thiemtaka thaw Levi mihai kuoma chun Hezekia chun thlamuonna thu a hril a. Chuongchun, ni sari sûng chu inremna thilinhlânhai chu inhlânin le, LALPA an thlatuhai Pathien kuoma chun thupha chawina siemin, ruoiṭhe sûng po po chun an fâk a."
And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.,"Chun, mipui inkhâwmhai po po chun ni dang la hmang nâwk dingin an remti a, ni sari dang chu lâwm- takin an la hmang nâwk a."
For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.,"Juda ram lal Hezekia chun mipui inkhâwmhai chu inhlân dingin bâwngchal sâng khat le, berâm sâng sari a pêk a; chun, hotuhai chun mipuihai chu bâwngchal sâng khat le berâm sîng khat an pêk bawk a, thiempu tam tawk tak el chu an insukthieng bawk a."
"And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.","Chun, Juda mipuihai po po, thiempuhai leh, Levi mihai leh, Israel rama inthawka mipui hunghai po po leh, Israel rama inthawka mikhuol hunghai po po leh, Juda rama umhai le chun an hlim hle tâwl a."
So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.,"Chuongchun, Jerusalema chun nasataka hlimna a um a, Israel lal David naupa Solomon hun china khan chu chuong ang chu Jerusalem- ah a um ngai nawh a."
"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.","Chun, thiempuhai, Levi mihai chu an tho a, mipuihai chu mal an sâwmpêk a; an râwlhai chu hrietin a um a, an ṭawngṭainahai chu a umna inthieng vâna chun a hang tlung a."
"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.","Chun, hieng thil po po hi zo a ni hnung chun, Israel chutaka umhai po po chu Juda khawpuiahai chun an feh a, lungphunhai chu an suknâwi a, Asera chu an phûrthlûk a; Benjamin le Juda ram po poa bâwl- hmunhai le mâichâmhai chu an vuok chim vawng a; Ephraim le Manasse rama khawm, a rênga an suksiet vawng hmakhat chun an thaw pei a. Chu, Israel thlahai chu, mi tin mâni hmun nei sengah, mâni khawpui sengah an kîr tah a."
"And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.","Hezekia chun an pâwlhai ang peiin thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu an pâwl a ruotpêk a; mi tin an sin- thaw ang peiin, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu LALPA bûk dai kawtkhâr- haia inpâk a, lâwmthu hril a, rawngbâwl a, inremna thilinhlânhai le pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu thaw dingin."
"He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlâna lal chan ding khawm ran a ruot a, anih, LALPA dâna ziek anga zîng- tieng le zântienga pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le, châwlnia pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhaia le, thla tharhaia le, ruoiṭhe hunbi neihaia ding chun."
"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.","Chunawa khawm, LALPA dâna an hrât theina dingin Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu an chan chu pe ve dingin Jerusalema umhai chu thu a pêk bawk a."
"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.","Thupêk chu phuongdar a ni phing le chun Israel thlahai chun bu dâm, uoin dâm, khuoizu dâm le lo hmasuok po poa ra hmasatakhai chu tamtak el an hungpêk tâwl a; thil po poa sâwma pakhat khawm tamtak el an hung pêk tâwl a."
"And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.","Juda ram khawpuihaia um Juda le Israel thlahai chun bâwng le berâmhaia sâwma pakhat dâm, an Pathien LALPA kuoma thilinhlân sukthieng tahai dâm chu an hung chawi a, a bûm bûmin an hung sieh a."
"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.","Thla thumnaa chun thil sie- khâwm chu an ṭan a, thla sarinaa chun an zo tah a."
"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.","Chun, Hezekia le hotuhai chu an hung a, thil siekhâwmhai chu an hmu chun LALPA le a mi Israelhai chu an inpâk a."
Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.,Hezekia chun Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu thil siekhâwm chungthu chu ân dawn a.
"And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.","Zadok sûngkuoa mi, thiempu laltak Azaria chun a dawn a, “Mipui haiin LALPA ina an thilpêkhai an hung chawi china chun kan fâkin a huntâwk kan nei tah a; a chuong tamtak hman kan nei rau a; LALPA chun a mihai chu mal a sâwm sih a, hi siekhâwm nasatak hi kan fâk mahla chu a ni hi,” an ta."
Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them;,"Chun, Hezekia chun LALPA ina chun, pindanhai buotsai dingin thu a pêk tah a; chun, an buotsai tah a."
"and they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully. And over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second;","Chun, thilpêkhai, sâwma pa- khat pêkhai, thilinhlânhai chu ringumtakin an hung lâk a; chu chunga chun Levi mi Konania chu a rorêltu a nih; a unaupa Simei chu a dawttu a na."
"and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.","Chun, Jehiel, Azazia, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakia, Mahath le Benaia chu, Pathien in rorêltu Azaria le lal Hezekia ruotin, Konania le a unaupa Simei hnuoia enkawltuhai an nih."
"And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.","Chun, saktieng dâi kawtkhâr vêngtu Levi mi Imna naupa Kore chu thil inthiengtakhai le, LALPA kuoma thilpêkhai chu sem dinga, Pathien kuoma mâni nuomthua thilinhlânhai chunga hotu a nih."
"And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:","Ama hnuoia chun Eden, Miniamin, Jesua, Semaia, Amaria le Sekania hai, thiempuhai khawpui- haia an sin ruotahai chun, an unau- hai chu, a chîn le lien kuoma an chan chit chu sem dingin an um bawk a;"

"Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.","thiempu Aron naupasalhai an khawpuihai khaw hmawr phûla umhai khawm chun, khawpui tamtak elahai chun, Levi mihai laia inthla dâna tiem sa po pohai le thiempuhai laia pasal po pohai kuoma an chanhai sempêk dingin, an hming suota ruot an um bawk a."
And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.,"Chuong ang tak chun lal Hezekia chun Juda ram sûng po poa chun a thaw suok vawng a; a Pathien LALPA hmaa ringumna le, thil indik le thil ṭha chu a thaw tah a."
"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.","Chun, LALPA ina rawngbâwlna sin a thaw tinrênga le, dâna le, thu- pêkahai chun, a Pathien chu zawng dingin lungril po poin a thaw hlak a; a hlawtling ngei a."
"After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.","Hi ringumna le hieng thilhai thaw a ni hnunga hin Assuria lal Sennakerib chu a hung a; Juda ram a hung lût a, khawpui kulneihai chu ân huol a, ama ta dinga hne el dingin a ngaituoh a."
"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,","Chun, Hezekia chun Sennakerib chu a hung a, Jerusalem hung do a tum a nih ti a hriet chun,"
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him.,"khawpui puotienga tuikhur tui- hai chu hrukping dingin a mi thilthawtheihai le a upahai chu a rawn tah a; chun, ama chu an ṭhangpui tah a."
"So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?","Chuongchun, mipui nasatak el chu an pung tah a; tuikhur po po le, ram laia tui luong vadungtêhai po po chu an hrukping ta vawng a, “Ieng- dingin am Assuria lal chu hungin, tui tamtak hung nei el a ta?” an tih a."
"And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.","Chun, ân sukhuoi a, kul se tahai po po chu a siem ṭha a; chutaka chun kuldâi danghai le râl vêngbûkhai chu a bâwl bawk a; chun, David khawpuia Millo chu a sukdet a, hriemhai le phawhai chu tamtakin a siem a."
"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,","Chun, mipuihai chunga chun indona hotuhai chu a ruot a, khawpui dâi kawtkhâr bula hmun âwl liena chun ama kuomah a ko khâwm tâwl a; an kuoma chun thlamuongumtakin thu a hril a,"
"Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:","“Hrât unla, insukhuoi ro, Assuria lal lei chun ṭi naw unla, beidawng bawk naw ro; ama kuoma um mipui nasatakhai lei khawm chun, ama kuoma um nêk chun eini kuoma um chu a hrât lem sih a;"
"with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.","ama kuoma chun tisaa sipai pâwl an na, amiruokchu, eini kuoma chu LALPA ei Pathien chu mi ṭhangpui ding le ei indona chu do dingin a um a nih,” tiin. Chun, mipui chu Juda lal Hezekia thuhrila chun an sâwldam hle a."
"After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,","Hi hnunga hin Assuria lal Sen- nakerib chun Jerusalemah a siehlaw a hung tir a (ama chu Lakis tlung hma el khan a um a, a sipaihai po po khawm ama kuoma chun an um a) Juda lal Hezekia le Jerusalema Juda umhai po po kuoma chun a hung tir a."
"Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?","“Assuria lal Sennakerib chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Jerusalem lâk chu ieng am a na in ring nawna?"
"Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?","Hezekia hin, Assuria lal kuta inthawk chun LALPA ei Pathien chun mi sansuok a tih, tiin dangchâr le ṭâma inthitir el ding cheuin a thlêm- thlûk cheu a ni naw am a nih?"
"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?","Hi Hezekia bawk hin bâwl- hmunhai le mâichâmhai chu a lâk- hmangin, Juda ram le Jerusalema mihai chu, Mâichâm pakhat hmaa chun Pathien chibai bûk in ta, a chunga chun riminhnik khawm in raw ding a nih, tia thu pe kha?"
Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?,"Kei le ka thlatuhai chun ram tin, hnam tin chunga chun ieng angin am kan thaw hlaka ti in hriet naw am a nih? Hieng ramhaia hnamhai pathienhai hin ka kuta inthawkin an ram ieng kawng khawmin an sanhim thei hlak am a nih?"
"Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?","Ka puhaiin an lo sukbohmang letdêr ta hnamhai pathien po po lai chun tu am ka kuta inthawka a mi- hai sansuok thei ding a um a, in Pathien khawm chun ka kuta in- thawkin a sansuok theina bîk ding cheu chu?"
"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?","Chuleiin, tuhin Hezekia hin hlêm naw raw se cheu, hieng ang kawng hin thlêmthlu bawk naw raw se cheu, nangni khawma ring hrim hrim naw ro; ka thlatuhai le keima kuta inthawk hin, tu ram amanih, tu hnam amani pathien chun a mihai chu a sansuok thei hrim hrim ngai si nawh a; ka kuta inthawk hin in Pathien chun a va sansuok thei âwm naw cheu deh aw!’” tiin."
"And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.","Chun, a siehlawhai chun LAL- PA Pathien chunga le a siehlaw Hezekia chunga chun hi nêk hman hin an la hril siet nasa det lem a."
"He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.","Israel Pathien LALPA chu hrilse dingin lekha a ziek a, ama kal zâwnga thu hril dingin, “Ram tina hnam tin pathienhai chun ka kuta inthawk hin an mihai an sansuok ngai naw angin, Hezekia Pathien khawm hin ka kuta inthawkin a mihai chu sansuok bîk naw nih,” tiin."
"And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.","Chun, khawpui chu an lâk el theina dingin Jerusalema mi umhai, kula umhai chu suklâu ding le, sukbuoi dingin Juda ṭawngin râwl inringtakin an khêk khum a."
"And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien chu hnuoia hnamhai pathienhai, mi- hriem kutsuokhai anga chun an hril a."
"And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.","Chun, lal Hezekia le Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai chu hi thu lei hin an ṭawngṭai a, vân tieng nghain an khêk a."
"And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.","Chun, LALPA chun vântirko a hung tir a, ama chun Assuria lal riebûka mi hrât khawkhênghai po po le ṭhuoituhai le hotuhai po po chu a sukhlum a. Chuongchun, hmai thûm- takin a ramah a kîr nâwk tah a. Chun, ama chu a pathien ina a hung lût laiin ama rîla rasuokhai ngei chun chutaka chun kâwlhnâmin an that tah a."
"Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Hezekia le Jerusalema umhai chu Assuria lal Sennakerib le mi danghai kuta inthawk chun a sanhim tah a, an vêla mihaia inthawk chun a vêng a."
"And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.","Chun, mi tamtak chun Jerusa- lemah LALPA kuomah thilpêkhai le, Juda lal Hezekia kuomah thil hluhai an hung chawi a; chuongchun, chutaka inthawk chun hnam po pohai mithmua chun chawimawiin a um tah a."
"In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign.","Chuong lai chun Hezekia chu thi ngamin a na tah a, chun LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a; chun, ama kuoma chun thu a hung hril a, in- chikna a hung pêk a."
"But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chunga ditsakna thaw ang huin Hezekia chun a ngaisak nâwk ta nawh a; a lungril chu ân ngaisâng sih a; chulei- chun, ama chunga chun lunginsenna chu a um a, Jerusalem le Juda ram chunga khawm chun."
"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.","Amiruokchu, Hezekia chun a lungril chapona chu ân sîr nâwk a, ân sukhnuoi a; ama le Jerusalema um- hai le chun; chuongchun, Hezekia dam sûng khan chu LALPA lungin- senna an chungah a hung tlung ta nawh a."
"And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;","Hezekia chun ropuina le hausakna nasatak el chu a nei a; tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, lung mantam dâm, riminhnik dâm, phaw- hai dâm, bûr le bêl ṭha tinrênghai ta dingin siekhâwmna inhai ama ta dingin a siem a;"
"store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.","hriek le uoin le bu hung punghai dinga siekhâwmna inhai dâm, ran ruolhai ta dinga inhai le, sa chi tinrêng po po ta dinga inhai a siem bawk a."
"Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.","Chunawa khawm chun bâwng ruol dâm, berâm ruol dâm, khaw- puihai dâm tamtak el a nei bawk a, Pathien chun thil tamtak el ama chu a pêk sih a."
"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.","Hi Hezekia bawk hin Gihon tuikhur hnâr sakhnung lem kha a hrukping a, David khawpui thlang- tieng panga khan a lâk thlâk a. Hezekia chu a sinthaw po poa chun a hlawtling pei a."
"Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.","Nisienlakhawm, Babulon lal- hai, chu rama thilmakhai chu indawn suok dinga a kuoma mi hungtirhai chungthua chun, a lungrila umhai po po chu a hriet theina dingin, fie dingin Pathien chun ama chu a thlathlam a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Hezekia thilthaw danghai le, a thilthaw ṭhathai chu, ngai ta, Israel le Juda lalhai lekhabua chun, Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai thil hmulâwkhaia chun ziek a nih."
"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Hezekia chu a thlatuhai lai a in tah a; David naupasalhai thlân in hang kainaa khan an phûm a; Juda mi po po le Jerusalema um po po chun a thi ni chun ropuitakin an râl a. Chun, a naupa Manasse chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.,"Manasse chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmpahnia upa a na, Jerusalema chun kum sâwmnga panga sûng ro a rêl a."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.","Ama chun LALPAIN Israel mi- hai hmaa a hnawt suokhai, khawhri be mihai tirdakumna ang chun LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a."
"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.","A pa Hezekiain a lo suksiet ta hnung bâwlhmunhai kha a siem ṭha nâwk a; Baal ta dingin mâichâmhai a dâw thar nâwk bawk a; Asera a siem a, vâna thil umhai po po chu chibai a bûk a, an rawng a bâwl bawk a."
"And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.","Chun, LALPA ina chun mâi- châmhai a siem a, LALPA chun a kuoma, “Jerusalema hin ka hming chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih,” a tinaa chun."
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.,LALPA in tuolpûk pahnia chun vâna thil umhai po po ta ding chun mâichâmhai a siem a.
"He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.","Hinnom naupa ruoma chun a nauhai chu mei ân fêthlengtir bawk a; aisân a hmang a, zâwldiaihai a hmang a, dâwi a hmang bawk a, thlarau zâwlhai a sawr bawk a, thiemrauhai leh; LALPA mithmua chun thil suol nasatak el ama chu suklungsen dingin a thaw tah a."
"And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:","Chun, milim kerṭielhai, ama siem chu LALPA ina chun a sie a; chu chungthua chun Pathien chun David le a naupa Solomon kuoma chun, “Hi ina le Jerusalema khawm, Israel hnam po po laia inthawka ka thlang suoka hin, kumkhuoa dingin ka hming chu sieng ka ta,"
"neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.","in thlatuhai ta dinga ram ka iruot taha inthawk chun Israel kepha chu sawn ta bawk naw ning a; Mosie hmanga thupêkhai, thuruothai, dân- hai po po, anni thu ka pêkhai po po chu an thaw phawt chun,” a lo tina LALPA ina chun a sie a nih."
"And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.","Manasse chun Juda le Jerusa- lema umhai chu ân suksuoltir a; chuongchun, Israelhai hmaa LALPA- IN a sukbohmang hnamhai nêk hman khan thil suol an thaw nasa lem a."
"And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.","Chuongchun, Manasse le a mi- hai kuoma chun LALPA chun thu a hril a, nisienlakhawm, an pawisa nawh a."
"Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.","Chuleiin, LALPAIN Assuria lal sipai hotuhai chu a hung ṭhuoi a, Manasse chu khaidietin an khit a, thîr kawl an inbuntir a, Babulonah an fepui tah a."
"And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.","Chuongchun, rimsitaka a hung um huna chun LALPA a Pathien chu a zawng a, a thlatuhai Pathien hmaa chun ama le ama chu nasatakin ân sukhnuoi tah a."
"And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.","Chun, ama kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai a, ama chu dawnsakin a um a, a hnina chu ngaiin a um a, ama ramah, Jerusalema chun hung ṭhuoi nâwkin a um tah a. Chun, Manasse chun LALPA chu Pathien a nih ti a hriet tah a."
"Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.","Chun, hi hnunga hin Nga dai Kawtkhâr lûtna, phairuom a, Gihon sîr thlang a, David khawpui dang a puo lema chun kul a bâwl a; Ophel tieng a sukkuol a, insângtakin a suk- sâng a; chun, Juda rama khawpui kul neiahai chun hotu thilthawthei- takhai a sie tâwl a."
"And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.","Chun, Pathien danglamhai le, milimhai chu LALPA ina inthawk chun a lâk suok a, LALPA in tlânga mâichâm a lo siem tahai po po le, Jerusalema mihai le khan a lâk hmang vawng a; khawpui puoa chun a peihâwn tah a."
"And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.","LALPA mâichâm chu a buotsai a, chutaka chun inremna thilinhlân- hai, lâwmthu hrilna inthâwinahai ân hlân a, Israel Pathien LALPA rawng chu bâwl dingin Juda mihai chu thu a pêk tah a."
"Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chu bâwlhmunhaiah an lân thâwi ta rawp a chu, LALPA an Pathien kuoma chun a nih an inthâwi."
"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.","Manasse thilthaw danghai le a Pathien kuoma a ṭawngṭaina dâm le Israel Pathien, LALPA hminga a kuoma zâwlneiin a hril thuhai dâm chu ngai ta, Israel lalhai thilthawhai lai chun ziek a nih."
"His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.","A ṭawngṭaina dâm, ama Pathienin a lo ngaisak dânhai dâm, a suolna po po le a bawsietna po po le, bâwlhmun a siemna hmunhai le, ama le ama ân sukhnuoi hmaa Asera a siem dâm le, milim ker a siemhai thu chu, ngai ta, Hozai chanchinbua chun ziek an nih."
"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Manasse chu a thlatuhai lai a in tah a, ama ina ngei chun an phûm tah a, a naupa Amon chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.,Amon chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pahnia upa a na; Jerusa- lema chun kum hni sûng ro a rêl a.
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.","A pa Manasse ang bawk khan, LALPA mithmuah thil suol chu a thawh a; Amon chu a pa Manassein milim ker a lo siem tahai po po kuoma khan ân thawi a, an rawng a bâwl a."
"And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.","A pa Manasse ân sukhnuoi ta ang khan ama hi chu LALPA hmaa chun ân sukhnuoi ve nawh a; chuong- chun, hi Amon hi chu a suol nasa deu deu tah a."
"And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.","Chun, a siehlawhai chun ama chu an phierrûk a, ama in sûnga ngei chun an that tah a."
But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.,"Amiruokchu, chu rama mihai chun lal Amon phierrutuhai po po an that a; chun, chu rama mipuihai chun a naupa Josia chu ama aia chun lalah an siem tah a."
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.,"Rorêl a ṭan chun Josia chu kum rieta upa a na, Jerusa- lema chun kum sâwmthum pakhat sûng ro a rêl a."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.","LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a, a thlatu David lampuihai chu a hrawh a, changtienga manih, vawitienga manih khawm a pêthmang nawh a."
"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.","Naupang a la ni laiin, a rorêl a kum rietnaa inthawk chun a thlatu David Pathien chu a zawng ṭan a; chun, kum sâwmpahninaa chun Juda ram le Jerusalem chu Asera dâm, milim a kera kerhai dâm, milim a sunga sunghai dâm le bâwlhmun po poa inthawk chun a sukthieng ṭan tah a."
"And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.","Ama hmaihmaa ngei chun Baal mâichâmhai chu a sukchim a; nisa milimhai, chuonghai chung daia um- hai chu a phûr thlûk a; Asera le milim a kera kerhai le a sunga sunghai chu a vuok nâwi vawng a, pilvutin a siem a, an kuoma lo inthâwi hlaktuhai thlân chungahai chun a phul a."
"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.","Chun, thiempuhai ruhai chu an mâichâmhai chunga chun a rawh a, Juda ram le Jerusalem chu a suk- thieng a."
"And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.","Chun, Manasse le Ephraim le Simeon khawpuihaia, Naphtali chen- in, an sietna hmun vêlahai chun chuong ang chun a thaw bawk a."
"And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.","Chun, mâichâmhai chu a suk- chim a, Asera chu, milim a kera kerhai le chun a vuok nâwi vawng a, Israel ram po poa inthawk chun nisa milimhai po po chu a phûr thlûk vawng a, Jerusalema chun a kîr nâwk tah a."
"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.","Chun, chuonga ram le in chu a sukthieng laia a rorêlna a kum sâwm pariet kum chun, Azalia naupa Saphan hai, khawpui sûng rorêltu Maaseia hai, Joahaz naupa Joa, thil inchiktuhai chu a Pathien LALPA in chu siem ṭha dingin a tir tah a."
"And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Thiempu laltak Hilkia kuoma chun an hung a, Levi mi kawtkhâr vêngtuhaiin Manasse le Ephraim mihai kuta inthawk le, Israel mi a la um sun po poa inthawk dâm, Juda le Benjamin mi po poa inthawk dâm, Jerusalema chêngtuhaia inthawka an lâk khâwmhai, Pathien ina sum hung lâka umhai kha, an hung pêk a."
And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house:,"Chun, chu chu LALPA in en- kawlna sin thawtuhai kuta chun an pêk a; chun, LALPA ina sinthawtuhai chu in siem ṭhatna ding le bâwl ṭhatna ding chun an pêk a,"
"even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.","in bâwltuhai le thingrem siem- tuhai kuoma lung saksahai, thing a zawmna dinghai inchâwkna ding le, Juda lalin a lo suksiet tah in bâwlna dinga thingtumhai siemna dingin."
"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music.","Mihai chun sin chu ringumtak- in an thawh a; annihai enkawltuhai chu Merari naupasalhai, Levi mi Jahath le Obadia hai; Kohath mi naupasalhai Zekaria le Mesullam hai chu an nih; Levi mihai, thil ri sutna thilhaia themthiem taphawthai chu."
"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.","Chun, phurrik phurtuhai en- kawltuhai khawm an ni bawk a, rawngbâwlna sin chu kawng ieng anga khawm an enkawl pei a; chun, Levi mihai chu ziektuhai, hotuhai le kawtkhâr vêngtuahai an um a."
"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah given by Moses.","Chun, LALPA ina tangka lâk lûta um chu an hung lâk suok chun, Hilkia chun Mosien a pêk, LALPA dân lekhabu chu a hmusuok a."
"And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.","Chun, Hilkia chun a dawn a, lekhaziektu Saphan kuoma chun, “LALPA ina chun dân lekhabu chu kan hmusuok tah,” a ta. Chuongchun, Hilkia chun lekhabu chu Saphan kuoma chun a pêk tah a."
"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.","Saphan chun lekha chu lal kuoma chun a chawi a; Saphan chun lal kuoma chun thu a hung intlun nâwk a, “I siehlaw hai kuoma thaw dinga pêk ang khan an thaw a;"
"And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.","LALPA ina tangka hmua um kha an bun suok a, sinthawtuhai kuta le a enkawltuhai kuta chun an pêk suok tah a,” tiin."
"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.","Chun, ziektu Saphan chun lal kuoma chun, “Thiempu Hilkia chun lekhabu a mi lo pêk a,” a ta. Chun, chutaka chun Saphan chun lal hmaa chun a tiem tah a."
"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.","Chun, lal chun dân thuhai chu a hriet chun a puonhai a keithlêr a."
"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,","Chun, lal chun Hilkia hai, Saphan naupa Ahikam hai, Mika naupa Abdon hai le lekhaziektu Saphan le lal siehlaw Asaia chu thu a pêk a,"
"Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book.","“Fe unla, kei le, Juda le Israel rama mâksana la umhai ta ding hin lekhabu hmu suoka um thu ang khan LALPA mi hung râwnpêk ta u; lekha- bua ziek po po, ang taka thaw dinga, ei thlatuhai chun LALPA thu chu an lo pawm ta naw lei khan, LALPA lunginsenna ei chunga bunthlâka um hi a nasa a nih,” tiin."
"So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they spake to her to that effect.","Chuongchun, Hilkia le lalin a tirhai po po chu, silfên vêngtu Hasra naupa Tokath naupa Sallum nuhmei, zâwlneinu Hulda kuoma chun an fe tah a, (chuong lai chun Jerusalema vêng pahninaa chun a um a nih), a kuoma chun chuong thua chun thu an hril tah a."
"And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,","Ama chun an kuomah, “Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Ka kuoma nangni hung tirtu cheu kuoma chun hieng hin hril ro,"
"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, Ngai ta u, hi hmuna le hi hmun hluotuhai chunga chun thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; Juda ram lal hmaa an tiem tah lekhabua khâng ṭawngsiehai po po kha,"
"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.","kei an mi lo nghatsan tah a; an kut sinthawhaia lunginsen dinga an mi chawktho theina dingin pathien danghai kuoma chun riminhnikhai an rawh a; chuleiin, ka lunginsenna chu hi hmun chunga hin bunthlâk a ni tah a, sukre el ni ta naw nih,’ tiin."
"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,","Amiruokchu, Juda lal, LALPA chu thu indawn dinga tirtu cheu kuoma chun hieng hin hril in ta, Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Thu i lo hriet ta chungthua chun,"
"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.","hi hmun le a sûnga chênghai chungthua, thuhai chu i hriet phinga i lungril ân nêm a, nangma le nangma chu Pathien hmaa chun în sukhnuoi leiin le, i puonhai i keithlêr a, ka hmaa chun i ṭap leiin kei khawma ka hung hriet ve che a nih."
"Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.","Ngai ta, i thlatuhai kuomah infetir ka ti cheh a, i thlâna chun thlamuongtakin fêng i ta, hi hmun le a sûnga umhai chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtir dinghai po po chu i mithaiin hmu naw nih a tih,’ ti ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, lal chu, thu chu an hung intlun nâwk a."
Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.,"Chun, lal chun mi a tir a, Jerusalem le Juda rama upahai po po chu a ko khâwm tah a."
"And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal chu LALPA ina chun a hang feh a; Juda rama mi po pohai le Jerusalema chêngtuhai le, thiem- puhai le Levi mihai le, mi po po a chîn a lienin an hang fe veh a; LALPA ina thuthlungna lekhabu hmua um sûnga thuhai po po an na hrieta chun a tiem tah a."
"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.","Chun, lal chu a hmuna chun a ngîr a, LALPA chu zui a, a thupêkhai, a thuinhriettirhai, a thuruothai chu a lungril po po le a lungvar po poa zâwm a, lekhabua thuthlung thu zieka umhai po po chu thaw dingin LALPA hmaa chun thuthlung a siem tah a."
"And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.","Chun, Benjamin le Jerusalema umhai po po chu chuong anga um dingin a tih a. Jerusalema chênghai chun an thlatu Pathien, Pathien thuthlung ang chun an thawh a."
"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chun, Josia chun Israel thlahai ihluo ram po poa inthawk chun tirdakumna po po chu a lâk hmang a, Israel rama umhai po po LALPA an Pathien rawng chu ân bâwltir a. A dam sûng po po chun an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA zuinaa inthawk chun an pêthmang nawh a."
And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.,Josia chun LALPA kuoma fekân ruoiṭhe chu Jerusalema chun a hmang a; thla hmasa tak ni sâwmpali ni chun fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu an that a.
"And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.","Thiempuhai chu an sinthawahai chun a ruot a, LALPA in rawngbâwl- naa ding chun ân fui tâwl a."
"And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel;","LALPA ta dinga inthieng Israel po po inchûktir hlak Levi mihai kuom a chun, “Israel lal David naupa Solomonin in a bâwla khan Thu- thlungna bâwm inthieng chu sie ro; in liengkoahai zâwn ngâi ta naw nih a; tuhin in Pathien LALPA le a mi Israelhai rawng chu bâwl ro."
"and prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.","Nangni khawm Israel lal David ziek ang le, a naupa Solomon ziek ang tak khan an pahnam ang peiin in pâwl bi chu insiem unla."
"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a father’s house of the Levites.","Chun, Levi hnam inṭhe dân ang pei le, in unau mipuihai pahnam in- ṭhe dân ang pei chun hmun inthienga chun ngîr unla."
"And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.","Chun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu that unla, nangni le nangni chu in- hlân thieng ro; Mosie hmanga LALPA thu ang tak kha thaw dingin in unauhai ta ding khawm chun buotsai bawk unla,” a ta."
"And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s substance.","Chun, Josia chun chu hnam thlahai, a umhai po kuoma chun ran ruol laia mi berâmte dâm, kêlte dâm sîng thum le bâwngchal sâng thum fekân ruoiṭhenaa inhlân dingin a pêk a; hi hi lal suma mi a nih."
"And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.","Chun, a hotuhai chun Levi mihai le thiempuhai le mipui kuoma chun nuom thua thilinhlân dinghai chu an pêk bawk a. Hilkia le Zekaria le Jehiel, Pathien in rorêltuhai chun thiempuhai kuoma chun fekân ruoi- ṭhena dingin ran chîn sâng hni le za ruk le, bâwngchal za thum an pêk a."
"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.","Konania le a unauhai Semaia le Nethanel le, Levi mihai hotuhai Hasabia le, Jeiel le, Jozabad chun Levi mihai kuomah fekân ruoiṭhenaa thilinhlân dingin ran ruol chîn sâng nga le bâwngchal za nga an pêk bawk a."
"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king’s commandment.","Chuongchun, rawngbâwlna chu buotsai a ni tah a, lal thupêk ang tak chun thiempuhai chu an hmuna chun an ngîr a, Levi mihai chu an pâwl dân ang peiin an thaw tah a."
"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.","Chun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu an that a, thiempuhai chun an kutin thisen chu an theh a, Levi mihai chun an inhlip a."
"And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai chu an sie hmang a, Mosie lekhabua ziek anga LALPA kuoma inhlân dinga, chu hnam thlahai pahnam inṭhe dân ang peia an pêk suok theina dingin. Chuongchun, bâwngchalhai khawm chu chuong ang bawk chun an thawh a."
"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.","Chun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu dân ang peiin meiah an em hmin a, chun, thilinhlân inthienghai sa kha chu bêlhai le, bêl bau ûmhai le, bêl indarhaiin an suong a, mi po pohai kuoma chun inhmâwtakin an fepui tah a."
"And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.","Chun, chu hnunga chun anni ta ding le thiempuhai ta ding chun an buotsai tah a; Aron naupasalhai thiempuhai chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le a thâuhai chu zân chen- in an buoipui tah a; chuleiin, Levi mihai chun anni le Aron naupasal thiempuhai ta ding chun an buotsai el a nih."
"And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.","Chun, David le Asaph le Heman le lal zâwlnei Jeduthun thupêk angin hlasaktuhai, Asaph naupasalhai chu an hmuna chun an um a; chun, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu dâi kawt- khâr tina chun an um bawk a; an sinthawhai chu an mâksan a ṭûl nawh a, an unau Levi mihai chun an ta dingin an buotsaipêk leiin."
"So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.","Chuongchun, lal Josia thupêk angin, LALPA rawngbâwlna po po chu ni khat sûngin, fekân ruoiṭhe hmang ding le LALPA mâichâm chunga pumrawhmang thilinhlân inhlân ding chu, buotsai vawng a ni tah a."
"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.","Chun, Israel thlahai chutaka umhai chun chu nia chun fekân ruoi- ṭhe chu an hmang a, chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu ni sari an hmang bawk a."
"And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Zâwlnei Samuel hun laia inthawk ta khan chuonga fekân ruoi- ṭhe chu Israel rama lal tu khawma Josiain a hmang ang hin an hmang ngai nawh a, thiempuhai le Levi mihai le, Israel le Juda chutaka umhai po po le, Jerusalema chênghai khawma an hmang ngai nawh a."
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.,Josia rorêl a kum sâwmpariet- naa chun a nih a hi fekân ruoiṭhe hi hmanga a um chu.
"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.","Hieng po po hnunga hin, Josia chun biekin chu a siem ṭha zo chun Aigupta lal Neko chu Euphrates vadung panga Karkemis chu rûn dingin a hang feh a; Josia chu ama tuok ding chun a fe suok tah a."
"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun aiâwtuhai a hung tir a, a kuomah, “Nang Juda lal, nang hi iengtin am ka thaw ding che a na?

"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.","Nisienlakhawm, Josia chun ama chu a kîrsan chuong nawh a, ama chu a do ngei theina dingin, ân sukdanglam a; Pathien baua in- thawka Neko thu chu a ngaisak nawh a, ama chu Megiddo ruoma do ding chun a suok tah a."
"And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.","Chun, thal kâp mihai chun Josia chu an kâp a, chun, lal chun a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Ka hliem nasa hle el sih a, mi sie hmang ro khai,” a ta."
"So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.","Chuongchun, a siehlawhai chun sakawr tawlailîra inthawk chun an lâk suok a, a sakawr tawlailîr danga chun an sieh a, Jerusalemah an hung ṭhuoi tah a; a thih a, a thlatuhai thlân ina chun phûmin a um tah a, Juda le Jerusalem po poin Josia chu an sûn a."
"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.","Chun, Jeremia khawm chun Josia chu a sûn a; vawisûn ni chen hin, hlasaktu pasal le hlasaktu nuhmeihai khawm chun Josia an sûnna hla chu an lân sam a; Israel rama chun thupêkhaiah an siem a, chuong chu, ngai ta, sûnnaa chun ziek an nih."
"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,","Josia thilthaw danghai le, a thilthaw ṭhathai chu, LALPA dâna ziek ang tak chun,"
"and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.","a thilthawhai a hmasatak le a nuhnungtak chu, ngai ta, Juda le Israel ram lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a nih."
"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.","Chun, chu ram mipuihai chun Josia naupa Jehoahaz chu an ṭhuoi a, a pa aia chun Jerusalema lalah an siem tah a."
Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.,Jehoahaz chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pathuma upa a na; Jerusalema chun thla thum sûng ro a rêl a.
"And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.","Aigupta lal chun ama chu Jeru- salema chun ân lalna a suktlâwm a, an ram chu rângkachak talent khat le tangkaruo talent za khat ân chawi- tir a."
"And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.","Chun, Aigupta lal chun a unaupa Eliakim chu Jerusalem le Juda ram chunga chun lalah a siem a; a hming chu Jehoiakim in a thleng tah a. Chun, Neko chun a unaupa Jehoahaz chu a ṭhuoi a, Aigupta ramah a fepui tah a."
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.,"Jehoiakim chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpakhat sûng ro a rel a; a Pathien LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a,"
"Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.","ama chu doin, Babulon lal Nebu- kadnezzar chu a hung a, thîrkawlhai- in a khuop a, Babulona ṭhuoi dingin."
"Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.","Nebukadnezzar chun LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai khawm chu Babulon tieng a phur hmang a, Babulona biekina chun a sie tâwl a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.","Jehoiakim thil thaw danghai le, thil tirdakum a thawhai le, amaa hmua umhai chu, ngai ta, Juda le Israel ram lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a nih; chun, Jehoiakin, a naupa chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.,"Jehoiakin chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum rieta upa a na, thla thum le ni sâwm sûng Jerusalema chun ro a rêl a. LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawhai chu a thawh a."
"And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.","Chun, kum hung inlet nâwka chun Nebukadnezzar chun mi a tir a, ama chu Babulonah, LALPA ina bûr le bêl ṭhahai le chun an hung ṭhuoi a, a unaupa Zedekia chu Juda le Jerusalem chunga chun lalah a siem tah a."
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:,Zedekia chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pakhata upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpakhat sûng ro a rêl a;
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Jehovah.,a Pathien LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a; LALPA baua inthawka thuhriltu Jeremia hmaa khawm chun ama le ama chu ân sukhnuoi nawh a.
"And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Pathiena ṭawng inkhâmtirtu Nebukadnezzar chunga khawm chun a hel bawk a; Israel Pathien LALPA kuoma kîr dingin, a lungril a sukngar a, ân sukkâwmâw bawk a."
"Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.","Chu nawa khawm chun, khaw- hri be mihai tirdakumna po po angin mipuihai le thiempu lalhai khawm chun nasatakin an bawsiet a; Jerusalema LALPA in a sukthieng ta chu an sukpawrche tah a."
"And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:","A umna hmun le a mihai chu a lunginsiet leiin, an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chun an kuoma chun a tirkohai chu a tir a,"
"but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.","nisienlakhawm, Pathien tirko- hai chu an nuisan a, a thu chu an hmusit a, a zâwlneihai chu an nuiêu a, sukṭhat nâwk theina um ta lo hiel khawpa, mipuihai chunga LALPA lungsenna chu chawkthoa a um hiel chen chun."
"Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.","Chuleichun, an chunga chun Kaldai lal a hung tir a, anni chun hmun inthienghaia chun an tlang- vâlhai dâm kâwlhnâmin an that a, tlangvâl amanih, nunghâkhai ama- nih, upa amanih, tar amani chunga khawm lunginsietna an nei nawh a, chuongchun, an rêng chun a kutah a pêk a."
"And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.","Pathien ina bûr le bêlhai, a lien le chînhai khawm, LALPA ina ro siekhâwlhai, lal ina ro siekhâwlhai le, a hotuhai tahai chen khawm chun Babulon tieng a lâk vawng a."
"And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.","Chun, Pathien in chu an rawh a, Jerusalem kul chu an vuokchim a, chutaka a lal inhai po po chu meiin an rawh a, chutaka bûr le bêl ṭhahai po po chu an suksiet bawk a."
And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:,Kâwlhnâma inthawka lo suok tahai chu Babulon tieng a ṭhuoi a; Persia ram rorêl a ni chen khan anni chu a nauhai le ama siehlawhai an na;
"to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: for as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.","chu ram chun a châwlni a hmang hmakhat chu Jeremia baua LALPA thu kha sukfamkim a ni theina dingin; râusana a um sûng po chu châwlni chu a hmang a na, kum sâwmsari suktling dingin."
"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,","Persia lal Kura inlal kum khat- naa chun, Jeremia baua LALPA thu sukfamkim a ni theina dingin, Persia lal Kura lungril chu LALPA chun a chawktho a, thuphuong a ram sûng po poa chun a siem a, zieka ziek khawmin a sie bawk a,"
"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.","“Persia lal Kura chun hieng ang hin a tih, Vâna Pathien LALPA chun hnuoi chunga ram po po chu a mi pêk a; Juda rama Jerusalema chun in bâwlpêk dingin a mi ruot tah a.

"Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.","Chunawa khawm dârsen mâi- châm a siem bawk a, a dungtieng tawng sâwmhni, a khangtieng tawng sâwmhni; ân sângtieng chu tawng sâwm."
"Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.","Chun, dâr tuizêng inbiel a sunga sungin, a reia inthawka rei khing- tieng tawng sâwm, intie vêl vawng, ân sângtieng tawng nga chu a siem bawk a; a rei a vêlin tawng sâwm- thum vêltuok a nih."
"And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.","Chun, a rei hnuoia chun kumûm ang a vêla vêlsuok, tawng khat pei sâwm seng, tuizêng vêla chun a siem a.

"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.","Bâwngchal lim sâwmpahni chunga inṭhut a na, pathum chun hmârtieng an nghah a, pathumin simtieng, pathumin thlangtieng, pa- thum bawkin saktieng an nghah a; chu dâr tuizêng chu an chunga chun inṭhut a nih; an hnungtieng chun sûngtieng a ngha seng a."
"And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.","Chun, kutpha bawka sa a na; a rei chu no rei anga siem a na, lili pâr angin, bath sâng thum dawng a nih."
"He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.","Insâwpna dingin châwtawl sâwm a siem a, panga chu changtieng pang- ah a sieh a, panga dang chu vawi- tiengah; chuong thilhai chu pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhai kha sâwpnaah an hmang hlak a, tuizêng ruok chu thiempuhai ta dinga insâwpna a nih."
"And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.","Chun, anni chungthua thupek angin rângkachak sathâu khâwnvar siena sâwm a siem a, chuonghai chu biek ina chun a sieh a, panga chu changtieng pangah, panga dang chu vawitiengah."

"And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.","Chun, maihûn chu a in pangah simsaktieng chun ân ṭhut a."
"And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:","Chun, Huram chun bêlhai, thlêngkûmhai le suodûrhai chu a siem a.

"The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon, for the house of Jehovah, of bright brass.","Bêlhai, suodûrhai, sakuoikim- hai le chutaka bûr le bêlhai po po chu Huram chun LALPA ina ding chun dârsen tle miin lal Solomon ta ding chun a lo siem vawng a."
"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.",Zereda le Sukkoth inkâra tlak- pil hmuna khan Jordan Phairuomah lal chun a lo sung a na.
Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.,"Chuongchun, Solomon chun hieng bûr le bêlhai po po hi tam tâwk takin a siem a, dârsen lem chu a bûk zât khawm hriet suok ruol a ni nawh a."

"and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold. And as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, were of gold.","khâwnvar vâm chepnahai, châwtawlhai, haihâwhai, meilâkna- hai chu rângkachak inthieng bawkin; chun, in lûtna chu, hmun inthieng- taka kawtkhâr sûngril lem le, in kawtkhârhai chu rângkachak an nih."
"Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.","Chuongchun, LALPA in dinga Solomonin sin a thaw po po chu zo a ni tah a.

"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.","Chun, Solomon chun David khawpui Ziona LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu hung la dingin, Israel thlahai pahnamhai laia ṭhuoituhai, hnam tin laia luhai le, Israel upahai chu Jerusalema chun a ko khâwm tâwl tah a."
"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.",Israel mihai po po chu thla sarinaa ruoiṭhenaa chun lal kuoma chun an hung khâwm vawng a.
And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;,"Israel upahai po po chu an hung a, Levi mihai chun bâwm chu an zâwn tah a."
"and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.","Chun, bâwm le, intuokna puon in le puon ina bûr le bêl inthienghai po po le chun an zu lâk tah a; hieng thilhai hi thiempu Levi mihai chun an zu lâk a nih."
"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.","Lal Solomon le Israel mipui ama hmaa hung inkhâwmhai po po chun berâm le bâwngchal a tam tienga tiem sênglo le hril thei lo chun inthâwiin, bâwm hmaa chun an um a."
"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.","Chun, thiempuhai chun LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu, chu in hmun inthieng, hmun inthiengtaka cherub- hai thla zar hnuoia a hmun dinga chun an hung lâklût tah a."
"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.","Cherubhai chun an thlahai chun bâwm umna hmun chu an zârkhum a, cherubhai chun bâwm le chutaka a zâwnfunghai chu an inkhum sa sih a."
And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.,"Chun, a zâwnfunghai chu an sei êm a, zâwnfung hmawrhai chu hmun inthieng hmaa inthawkin ân hmu thei a; amiruokchu, puotienga in- thawk chun ân hmu thei nawh a; chutaka chun tu chen hin a um tah a."
"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.","Chu bâwm sûnga chun, Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia Israel thlahai kuoma LALPAIN thu- thlung a siem laia Mosien Horeba lungphêk pahni a sie lût chau naw kha chu ieng dang khawm a um nawh a."
"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;","Chun, thiempuhai chu hmun inthienga inthawka an hung suok chun, (thiempu chutaka um po pohai chu an pâwl hunbi nghâk kher loin sukthieng an ni hlak sih a;"
"also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets);","Levi mi chutaka hla saktuhai khawm chu an rêngin, Asaph hai, Heman hai, Jeduthun hai, an naupasalhai le an unauhai leh puon zai inhmi puona inthuomin, per- khuong leh, ṭingṭang leh dârben- thekhai leh mâichâm tâwp saktieng panga chun an ngîr a; anni lai chun thiempu za le sâwmhni tawtawrâwt mûttuhai an um bawk a):"
"it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,","LALPA inpâka, lâwmthu hrila, hla saktuhai le tawtawrâwt puhai chu pakhat ang el a, ri inremtaka hriet a ni hlak a; tawtawrâwthai le, dârbenthekhai le, rimawi thawna thuomhnawhai leh an râwlhai an insuo a, LALPA chu inpâka, “Ama chu a ṭha sih a; a zângaina chu kum- khuoin um zing a tih,” an ti pha chun, LALPA in chu sûmin a hung sip hlak a,"

"And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.","Chun, lal chu a ngha kîr a, Israel inkhâwmhai po po chu mal a sâwm a; Israel mipuihai po po chu an ngîr ṭhup a."
"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,","Chun, ama chun a hril a, “Israel- hai Pathien LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se, ka pa David kuoma a baua thu lo hril a, a bânhaia lo sukpui- tlingtu chu:"
"Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:","ama chun, ‘Aigupta rama in- thawka ka mihai ka ṭhuoi suok nia inthawk tah, Israel hnam po po laia inthawkin, ka hming um zingna dinga in bâwlna dingin khawpui ka ruot nawh a; ka mi Israelhai chunga lala um dingin tukhawm ka thlang bawk nawh;"

"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, ka pa David lung- rila chun Israelhai Pathien LALPA hminga in bâwl nuomna a um a."
"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:","Amiruokchu, LALPA chun ka pa David kuoma chun, ‘Ka hming dingin, in bâwl dingin lungril i nei a ni âwm a; hieng i lungrila um hi i thaw ṭha ngawt el;"

"And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun thu a hril ta chu a hung puitling pei a; ka pa David hmuna chun ka hung ngîr tah a, LALPAIN a lo tiem ta angin Israel ram lal ṭhungphaa chun ka ṭhung tah a, Israelhai Pathien LALPA hming ding chun in chu ka bâwl ta a nih."

"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.","Chuleiin, tuhin aw LALPA, Israelhai Pathien, ‘Ka hmaa i khaw- sak anga, ka dân hraw dinga i thlahaiin an pawi sa chun; ka mit- hmuah Israel lal ṭhungphaa ṭhung ding mi intlâksamtir naw ning che,’ tiha ka pa David i siehlaw kuoma i lo tiem ta kha hung hre zing rawh."

"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.","Solomonin ṭawngṭaina chu a suktâwp chun, vâna inthawkin mei a hung tlah a, inthâwinahai le pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu a kâng hmang a; LALPA ropuina chun in chu a suksip tah a."
"And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah’s house.",LALPA in chu LALPA ropuinaa suksipa a um leiin thiempuhai chu LALPA ina chun an lût thei nawh a.
"And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","Mei a hung tla a, in chunga chun LALPA ropuina a um zing lai chu Israel thlahai chun an en zing a; tuolzâwla chun an hmaihaia hnuoi sikin an kûn a, chibai an bûk a; “Ama chu a ṭha sih a, a zângaina chu kum- khawtluonga um zing ding a nih,” tiin, LALPA chu lâwmthu an hril a."
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.,"Chun, lal le mipuihai po po chun LALPA hmaa chun inthâwina an inhlân a."
"And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.","Chun, lal Solomon chun bâwng- chal sîng hni le sâng hni le, berâm nuoi khat le sîng hniin inthâwina ân hlân a. Chuongchun, lal le mipuihai po po chun Pathien in chu an inhlân tah a."
"And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah (for his lovingkindness endureth for ever), when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.","Thiempuhai chu an sinthaw ang pei chun an ngîr a; an rawngbâwlnaa Davidin ân pâk laia, “A zângaina chu kumkhawtluongin a um zing sih a,” tia, LALPA inpâkna dinga lal Davidin LALPA thil rimawi thuomhnawhai a siemhai le chun Levi mihai chu an ngîr ve a; chun, thiempuhai chun an hmaa chun tawtawrâwt an hang mût a, Israel mihai po po chu an ngîr ta ṭhuop a."
"Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.","Chunawa khawm, Solomon chun LALPA in tuolsûng hmun lailung chu a sukthieng bawk a; Solomonin dârsen mâichâm a ilo siem ta chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le, bu thil- inhlân le, a thâuhai chu a keng naw leiin, chutaka chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thilinhlân thâuhai chu ân hlân sih a."
"So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Israel mihai po po, mipui pung- khâwm nasatakhai, Aigupta vadung- têa inthawka Hamath lûtna chena mihai le chun ni sari sûng chu ruoi an ṭheh a."
"And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.","Chun, a ni riet ni chun in- khâwmna huntâwp chu an nei a; mâichâm inhlânna chu ni sari sûng khan an nei a, ni sari sûng ma chun ruoiṭhena an nei bawk a."
"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.","Chuongchun, thla sarinaa ni sâwmhni pathum ni chun mipuihai chu an puon in tienghai chun, a mi Israelhai chunga le Solomon chunga le David chunga LALPAIN ṭhatna a lo inentirna lei chun lungrila lâwmtak le thafântak chun a tir kîr tah a."
"Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun lal in le LALPA in chu a zo tah a; LALPA in le ama ina thaw dinga Solomon lungrila um po pohai chu puitling takin a zo tah a."
"And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.","Chun, zâna chun LALPA chu Solomon kuomah a hung inlâr a, a kuomah, “I ṭawngṭaina ka lo hriet a, ka kuoma inthâwina in dingin hi hmun hi ka thlang tah a nih."
"If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;","Vân chu ka sukping a, ruo a sûr naw chun amanih, khâuhai chu ram chu fa zo dinga thu ka pêkin amanih, ka mihai laia hin hripui ka hung tîrin amanih;"
"if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.","ka mihai, ka hming chawia kohai chu an insukhnuoi a, an ṭawngṭai a, an lampui rilohai chu nghatsan a ka hmêl an hung zawng chun, vâna inthawk chun lo hrieng ka ta, an suol chu ngaidam ka ta, an ram khawm chu sukhrisêl bawk ka tih."
"Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.","Chuongchun, hi hmuna ṭawng- ṭaina inhlâna umhai chu, ka mithai chu meng ka ta, ka nahai chun ngai a tih."
"For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.","Kumkhawtluonga ka hming a um zing theina dingin hi in hi ka thlangin ka lo sukthieng ta sih a; chuongchun, ka mithai le ka lungril khawm chu chutaka chun um châm- chîng a tih."
"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;","Chun, nanga chungthua chu thu ka pêk po pohai che ang peia i thaw a, i pa David khawsak anga ka hmaah i khawsa a, ka thuruothai le ka rorêlhai chu i zâwm chun;"
"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.","‘Israel rama rorêltu ding intlâk- samtir naw ning che,’ tia i pa David kuoma thu ka lo thlung ta ang khan i lalram lalṭhungpha chu sukdet ka tih."
"But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;","Amiruokchu, i pêt hmang a, i hmaa thupêkhai le thuruothai ka siehai chu i nghatsan a, i fe a, pathien danghai rawng i bâwl a, anni chu chibai i bûk chun;"
"then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.","ram ka ipêk, ka rama inthawkin a zung pumin anni chu phawidawk ka ta, chun, hi in ka hminga ka lo sukthieng ta khawm hi ka hmu phâk nawah sawn hmang ka ta, hnam tin laia chun ti-elna le ṭawngnaa hmang dingin siem ka tih."
"And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?","Chun, hi in hieng ang lâwma insâng hi, a fekhêltuhai taphawt chun mak la tîng an ta, ‘Hi in le hi ram hi LALPA chun ieng am a law a ni ta le?’ tiin."
"And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.","Chun, anni ma chun, ‘Aigupta rama inthawka anni ṭhuoi suoktu an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an nghatsan a, pathien danghai an chel a, chibai an bûk vêl a, an rawng an bâwl a, chuleiin, hieng thil ṭha naw po po hi an chungah a hung intlungtir a nih hi,’ la tîng an tih” a ta."
"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,","Chun, kum sâwmhni sûng, Solomonin ama in le LALPA in a bâwl sûng chun,"
"that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.","Huramin Solomon kuoma khaw- pui a pêkhai chu, Solomon chun a siem ṭhah a, chuonga chun Israel thlahai chu ân umtir a."
"And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.","Chun, Solomon chu Hamath- zobaa chun a va feh a, a va hne tah a."
"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.","Thlalêr hmuna chun Tadmor khuo chu a siem a, sie khâwmna khawpuihai po po chu Hamatha chun a bâwl a."
"Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;","Beth-horon chunghnung le, Beth-horon thlanghnung lem chu a bâwl bawk a, chuong chu khawpui kul nei, bang neia dai kawtkhâr le kalna thîrhai nei an nih;"
"and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.","chun, Baalath le siekhâwmna khawpui Solomonin a neihai po po le, sakawr tawlailîrhai ta dinga khaw- puihai po po le, sakawr chung chuong mihai ta dinga khawpuihai le, Lebanon le Jerusalem le, a rorêlna ram sûng po poah Solomonin a nuom- sip tâwlna dinga bâwl a nuomhai po po chu a nih."
"As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;","Chun, hnam po pohai, Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai, Jebus mihai a la umhai Israel mi ni lohaia le,"
"of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.",an thlahai chu rama an mâksana Israelhaiin an lo sukbohmang naw- hai chunga chun vawisûn ni chen hin Solomon chun suok nina sie chu ân chawitir a.
"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.","Amiruokchu, Israel thlahai chu Solomon chun a sinthawnaa chun sie- hlawah a siem nawh a; indo mi le, a hotutakhai le, a sakawr chung chuong mihai le a sakawr tawlailîr- hai chunga rorêltuhai an ni lem a."
"And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.","Chun, hienghai hi Solomon hotutakhai, za hni le sâwmnga, mi- puihai chunga ro phurtuhai chu an nih."
"And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath come.","Solomon chun Pharao naunu chu David khawpuia inthawkin a in dinga bâwla chun a zu ṭhuoi a; “Israelhai lal David ina chun ka nuhmei chu a um ding a ni nawh, a hmunhai chu LALPA bâwm hungna a nih a, ân thieng leiin,” a ti sih a."
"Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,","Chun, tuolpûk hmaa LALPA mâichâm a siema chun Solomon chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu ân hlân a,"
"even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.","ni tinin vawi ieng zât pei amanih, châwlniahai, thla tharahai, ruoiṭhe hunahai Mosie thupêk ang peia inhlânin; kum khat sûngah vawi thum, chawl ṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhea le, hapta kâr ruoiṭhehaia le, bâwkte ruoiṭhehaia le chun."
"And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.","Chun, a pa Davidin a lo sukdet ta angin, an rawngbâwlna dingin thiempuhai pâwl hun chu a ruotpêk a; chun, Levi mihai khawm chu sin tuk an nina, inpâk ding le thiempu- hai hmaa rawngbâwl dingin, ni tina a ṭûl ang peia an bituk angin a ruot bawk a; dai kawtkhâr tinahai chun kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu an pâwl hun ang peiin, chuong ang chun Pathien mi David chun thu a lo pêk ta sih a."
"And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.","Chun, ro siekhâwmna in chung- thu le, thu ieng kima hrim hrim Levi mihai le thiempuhai kuoma lal thupêkhai chu an ngaitha ngai dêr nawh a."
"Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.","Chuongchun, LALPA in chu a lungphûm phûm nia inthawka zo a ni chenin Solomon sinhai po po chu thaw zing a na. Chuongchun, LALPA in chu a puitlin a nih."
"Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the sea-shore in the land of Edom.","Chun, Solomon chu Edom rama tuipui kama Eloth le Ezion-gebera chun a fe tah a."
"And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.","Chun, Huram chun a sie- hlawhai kutin lawnghai le siehlawhai tuisuoriet chanchin hre mihai chu ama kuoma chun a thawn a; chuong- chun, anni chu Solomon siehlawhai le chun Ophira chun an feh a, chutaka inthawk chun rângkachak talent za li le sâwmnga an hung phur a, lal Solomon kuoma chun an hung lâk a."
"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.","Seba lalnu chun Solomon chan- chin chu a lo hrietin, indawnna intak takhai le Solomon chu fie dingin rawi nasatak leh; sanghâwng- sei, riminhnik le rângkachak tamtak le lunghluhai phurtuhai le chun Jerusalema chun a hung a; chun, Solomon kuom a hung tlung chun, a lungrila umhai po po thua chun ama chu ân biekpui tah a."
And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.,"Chun, Solomon chun ân dawn- nahai po po chu a dawn a, Solomon ihriet naw thil, a dawn thei naw iengkhawm a um nawh a."
"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,","Chun, Seba lalnu chun Solomon varzie le, in a ibâwl ta le,"
"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.","dawkâna a bu dâm, a siehlaw inṭhunghai le a rawngbâwltuhai ngîrzie dâm le, an incheinahai le, a no chawituhai le an incheinahai le, a kailâwn LALPA in a hang fena chu a hmu chun, amaa chun lungril dang hrim a um ta nawh a."
"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “I varzie le i thilthawhai keia rama ka lo hriet thuthanghai hi ân dik ngei a ni hi."
"Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.","Kei ngei ka hung a, ka mit ngeia ka hung hmu hma khan chu an thuhai ka lo ring nawh a; ngai ta, i varna nasatzie chenve khawm hi hril ka lo ni naw hi tie; i hminginthangna ka lo hriet hi i khûm dai a nih."
"Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.","I mihai chu an vângnei a nih, i siehlaw i hmaa ngîr zing zinga, i varna thu ngai hlakhai chu an va vângnei de!"
"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.","LALPA i Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se; ama chun LALPA i Pathien ta dinga lal ni dinga lalṭhungphaa inṭhungtir che chu a lâwm zâwng tak a na; i Pathien chun Israelhai chu kumkhuoa tungding zing chu a nuom zâwng a ni leiin, indiktaka rorêlna chu nei dingin an chunga lalah a siem che a ni hi,” a ta."
"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.","Ama chun lal chu rângkachak talent za le sâwmhni le, riminhnik tamtak le, lunghluhai a pêk a; Seba lalnuin Solomon kuoma a pêk ang hrim hrim riminhnik a la um ngai nawh."
"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.","Chun, Huram siehlawhai le Solomon siehlawhai Ophira in- thawka rângkachak hung phurtuhai khan algum thing le lunghlu an hung phur a."
"And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.","Chun, lal chun algum thing chu LALPA in ta ding le lal ina inhuonna ding le, hla saktuhai ta dinga per- khuong le ṭingṭanghai dingin a siem a; chuong ang hrim hrim chu Judai rama chun a hmain hmu a ni ngai nawh a."
"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.","Chun, lal Solomon chun Seba lalnu kuoma chun a dit taphawt, a hni phawt chu amain a hung chawi ang ni lo phawt kha chu a pêk veh a. Chun, a kîr a, ama ram ngeia chun ama le a siehlawhai chu an fe tah a."
"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,","Kum khat sûnga Solomon kuoma rângkachak hung lût bûk zât chu, rângkachak talent za ruk sâwmruk paruk a nih:"
besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.,"chu chu dâwrkaihai le sum dâwnghaiin an hung lâk lût tiemsa loin a nih; chun, Arabia rama lalhai po po le ram sûnga rorêltuhai po po chun Solomon kuomah rângkachak le tangka an hung lâk lût a."
And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.,"Chun, Solomon chun rângka- chak âwmphaw a suta sutin za hni a siem a, âwmphaw pakhata chun rângkachak sutphêk shekel za ruk a lût a."
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.,"Chun, rângkachak a suta sutin phâw za thum a siem a, phaw pa- khata chun rângkachak sutphêk shekel za thum a lût a; chun, lal chun chuonghai chu Lebanon ramhnuoi inah a sieh a."
"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.","Chunawa khawm, lal chun sai- ha lalṭhungpha a siem a, rângkachak inthiengin ân luon khum a."
"And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.","Chun, lalṭhungpha hang kaina chu kailâwn paruk sirpha rângka- chak seng lalṭhungphaa zawmnghet a na; chun, ṭhungna hmun sir khing ve vea chun sakeibaknei lim pahni an ngîr bawk a."
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.,"Chun, kailâwn paruka chun sîr khatah sakeibaknei sâwm le pahni an ngîr a, a sîr khingtienga khawm chun; khâwlai rama khawm hieng anga siem hi a la um ngai nawh."
"And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.","Chun, lal Solomon dâwnna nohai po po chu rângkachak an na, Lebanon ramhnuoi ina bûr le bêlhai po po khawm chu rângkachak inthieng an nih, Solomon hun lai hin tangkaruo hin hlutna a nei rak nawh."
"For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.","Huram siehlawhai le Tarsisa fe hlak lal chun lawnghai inkawppui a nei sih a, kum thum dan peiah Tarsis lawnghai chu hungin rângkachak dâm, tangkaruo dâm, saiha dâm, zâwng dâm, ârawn dâm a hung phur hlak a."
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.,"Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun hnuoia lalhai po po chu varna le hausaknaa chun a khûm a nih."
"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.","Chun, hnuoia lalhai po po chun Pathienin a lungrila varna a sie chu ngai dingin Solomon chu an hung pan huoi huoi hlak a."
"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.","Chun, mi tin chun a thilpêk, rângkachak bûr le bêlhai, tangkaraw bûr le bêlhai,silfên dâm, râlthuom dâm, riminhnik dâm, sakawr dâm, sabengtung lien chi dâm, kum tina bituk angin an hung pêk seng hlak a."
"And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.","Chun, Solomon chun sakawrhai le sakawr tawlailîrhai ta dingin in sâng li le, sakawr chung chuong mi sîng khat le sâng hni a nei a; sakawr tawlailîr khawpuihaia le lal kuoma Jerusalema a siehai chu a nih a."
"And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.","Chun, lal po po vadungpuia inthawka Philistin mihai ram chenin, Aigupta ramri chena umhai chunga chun ro a rêl a."
"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.","Chun, lal chun a tam êm lei chun Jerusalema chun tangkaruo chu lung ang el le, Sidar thing chu phai- ruoma theichang thinghai ang elin a siem a."
"And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.","Chun, Aiguptaa inthawk le ram tina inthawkin Solomon ta dingin sakawrhai chu an hung lâk a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?","Solomon thilthaw danghai, a hmasa le tâwpna chenin zâwlnei Nathan ziek chanchin bua le, Silon mi Ahija hrillâwknaa le, Nebat naupa Jeroboam chungthua zâwlnei Iddo thil hmulâwkahai chun ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.,Solomon chun Israel po po chunga chun kum sâwmli Jerusalem- ah ro a rêl a.
"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Solomon chu a thlatuhai kuomah a in a, a pa David khuoa chun phûm a ni tah a; a naupa Rehoboam chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
