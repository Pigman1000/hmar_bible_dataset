In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.,A tîrin Pathienin hnuoi le vân a siem a.
And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.,"Chun, hnuoi hi a sie le a ruok ngawt a na, tui inthûktak chung chu ân thim mup a. Pathien Thlarau chun tui chunghai chu a awp zing a."
"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.","Chun, Pathienin, “Var hung um raw se,” a ta; chuongchun, var a hung um tah a."
"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.","Chun, Pathienin var chu a en a, ṭha a ti hleh a: chuongchun, Pathien chun var le inthim chu a ṭhe tah a."
"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.","Pathienin var chu “Sûn” ân bûk a, inthim chu “Zân” ân bûk a. Chuongchun, zântieng a um a, zîngtieng a um bawk a; chu chu ni khatna."
"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.","Chun, Pathienin, “Tui le tui kâra chun boruok lientak um sienla, chu chun tui le tuihai chu ṭhe raw se,” a ta."
"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.","Chuongchun, Pathienin boruok lientak chu a siem a, boruok lientak hnuoia tui umhai le boruok lientak chunga tui umhai chu a ṭhe tah a: chuong angtak chu a lo ni tah a."
"And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.","Chun, Pathienin boruok lientak chu “Vân” ân bûk a. Chuongchun, zântieng a um a, zîngtieng a um bawk a; chu chu ni hnina."
"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.","Chun, Pathienin, “Vân hnuoia tui umhai chu hmun khatah luong khâwm sienla, khawmuol chu inlang raw se,” a ta: chuongchun, chuong angtak chun a hung ni tah a."
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.,"Pathienin khawmuol chu “Hnuoi” ân bûk a, tui um khâwmhai chu “Tuisuoriethai” ân bûk a: Pathienin chu chu a en a, ṭha a ti hleh a."
"And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.","Chun, Pathienin, “Hnuoi hin hlo dâm, thlai chi nei dâm, thei kûng hnuoi chunga mâni chi um dân ding anga ra, a ra sûnga a chi um dâm chu hung insuo raw se,” a ta: chuong angtak chun a hung um tah a."
"And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.","Hnuoi chun hlo dâm, thlai mâni um dân ding anga chi nei dâm, thing mâni chi um dân ding anga ra, a ra sûnga a chi um dâm chu ân suo tah a: Pathienin a en a, ṭha a ti hleh a."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.","Chuongchun, zântieng a um a, zîngtieng a um bawk a, chu chu ni thumna."
"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:","Chun, Pathienin, “Sûn le zân ṭhêna dingin vân boruok lientaka chun varhai um sienla, chuonghai chu inchikna dâm, hunbi dâm, ni dâm, kum dâm hrietna ding ni raw se;"
and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.,"hnuoi chung elvar dingin vân boruok lientaka chun varhai ni bawk raw hai se,” a ta: chuong angtak chun a hung ni tah a."
"And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.","Chuongchun, Pathienin var ropuitak pahni khi a siem tah a; var ropui lem chu sûn rorêltu dingin, var ropui naw lem chu zân rorêltu dingin: arasihai khawm a siem bawk a."
"And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,","Pathienin chuonghai chu vân boruok lientaka khin a sie tah a: hnuoi chung sukvar ding le,"
"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.","sûn le zân chunga rorêl ding le var le inthim chu ṭhe dingin. Pathien- in chu chu a en a, ṭha a ti hleh a."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.","Chuongchun, zântieng a um a, zîngtieng a um bawk a, chu chu ni lina."
"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.","Chun, Pathienin, “Tuihai chun thilsiem chângthei hringna neihai tamtak insuo ṭeu hai sienla, vatehai khawm chu hnuoi chunga vân boruok lientaka hin vuong raw hai se,” a ta."
"And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.","Chuongchun, Pathienin tuisuo- rieta thilhring lientak takhai chu a siem a, thilsiem hringna nei le chângthei tinrêng tuiin a insuo ṭeuhai chu anni chi um dân ding ang sengin a siem bawk a, vate thla nei tinrêng khawm anni chi um dân ding ang sengin a siem a: Pathienin chu chu a en a, ṭha a ti hleh a."
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.","Chun, Pathienin, “Chi tamtak inthlain hung pung unla, tuisuoriet tuihai suksip ro, vatehai khawm hnuoiah pung raw hai se,” tiin mal a sâwm a."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.","Chuongchun, zântieng a um a, zîngtieng a um bawk a; chu chu ni ngana."
"And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.","Chun, Pathienin, “Hnuoi chun thilsiem hringna neihai, anni chi um dân ding ang sengin: ran, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwnhai le ramsahai, anni chi um dân ding ang sengin insuo raw se,” a ta: chuong angtak chu a hung ni tah a."
"And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.","Chuongchun, Pathienin, ram sa anni chi um dân ding ang sengin, ran dâm anni chi um dân ding ang sengin, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwnhai po po, anni chi um dân ding ang sengin a siem a: Pathienin chu chu a en a, ṭha a ti hleh a."
"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.","Chun, Pathienin, “Ei angpuiin, eini angtakin, mihriem siem inla, anni chu tuisuorieta nga chunga dâm, chunglêng vate chunga dâm, ran chunga dâm, hnuoi chung po poa le thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn po po chunga dâm, thu inneitir ei tiu,” a ta."
"And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.","Chuongchun, Pathienin ama angpuiin mihriem a siem a, Pathien angpui ngeiin a nih a siem chu, pasal le nuhmeiah a siem a nih."
"And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.","Chun, Pathienin anni chu mal a sâwm a, Pathien ma chun an kuomah, “Chi tamtak thlain hung pung unla, hnuoi hi hluo sip unla, in thu thuin inumtir ro; tuisuorieta nga chunga dâm, chunglêng vate chunga dâm, thilhring hnuoi chunga bawkinvâka lâwn po po chunga dâm thu nei bawk ro,” a ta."
"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:","Chun, Pathien bawkin, “Ngai ta u, hnuoi chung po poa um thlai chi nei tinrêng le thing tinrêng chi nei ra um hai chu ka pêk cheu a nih: in bu ding nîng an tih."
"and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.","Chun, hnuoia sa tinrêng kuoma dâm, chunglêng vate tinrêng kuoma dâm, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn tinrêng kuoma dâm, hringna nei taphawt kuoma chun, an bu ding- in hlohna tinrêng ka pêk a nih,” a ta: Chuong angtak chu a hung ni tah a."
"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.","Chun, Pathienin a thilsiem tinrêng chu a en a, ngai ta, ṭha a ti êm êm a. Chuongchun, zântieng a um a, zîngtieng a um bawk a, chu chu ni rukna."
"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, namely, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.","Hieng hi Noa naupasal, Sem, Ham, le Japheth thlahai chu an nih; tuilêt hnunga naupasal an ineihai chu."
"The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.","Japheth naupasalhai chu: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Mesek le Tiras an nih."
"And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.","Gomer naupasalhai chu: Askenaz, Riphath le Togarma an nih."
"And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.","Javan naupasalhai chu: Elisa, Tarsis, Kittim le Dodanim an nih."
"Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.","Chuonghaia inthawk chun a nih tuipui kama hnamhai chu anni ram ramah an indar ta chu: anni ṭawng ang pei le, anni hnam ang peiin, anni chihai laia seng chun."
"And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.","Ham naupasalhai chu: Kush, Mizraim, Put le Kanaan an nih."
"And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.","Kush naupasalhai chu Seba, Havila, Sabta, Raama le Sabteka hai an nih. Raama naupasalhai chu Sheba le Dedan an nih."
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.,Kush chun naupasal Nimrod a nei a: ama chu hnuoia mi hrât hmasatak a nih.
"He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.","LALPA hmaha ramsuok mi hrâttak a nih; chulei chun a nih, “LALPA hmaha ramsuok mi hrâttak Nimrod ang a nih,” an ti hlak chu."
"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.","Ân lal phutna chu Sinar rama Babel, Erek, Akkad le Kalne khuo a nih."
"Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,","Chu rama inthawk chun a suok a, Assuriaah a lût a, Ninevi, Rehoboth-Ir, Kala le,"
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).,Ninevi le Kala inkâra Resen khuohai a siem a (chu Resen chu khaw ropuitak a nih).
"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,","Chun, Mizraim chun Lud, Anam, Lahab, Naphtu,"
"and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.","Pathrus, Kaslu (Philistinhai suokna) le Kaphtor mihai a thlah a."
"And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,","Kanaan chun a nau lutîrah Zidon a nei a, Heth khawm a nei bawk a;"
"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,","Jebus-hai, Amor-hai, Girgas- hai,"
"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,","Hiv-hai, Arko-hai, Sin-hai,"
"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.","Arvad-hai, Zemar-hai, Hamat- hai, a thlah a; chu hnunga chun Kanaan hnamhai chu an hung indar lien pei tah a."
"And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.","Chun, Kanaan hnamhai ramri chu Zidona inthawkin Gerar pan zâwngin Gaza chenin; Sodom, Gomorra, Adma le Zeboiim pan zâwngin, Lasa chenin a nih."
"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.","Chuonghai chu Ham thlahai chu an nih, anni hnamhai ang pei le anni ṭawng ang peiin, anni ram rama le anni chi lai chun."
"And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.","Sem, Eber nau po pohai thlatu, Japheth u khawm chun nauhai a nei veh a."
"The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.","Sem naupasalhai chu: Elam, Assur, Arpaksad, Lud le Aram an nih."
"And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.","Aram nauhai chu: Uz, Hul, Gether le Mash an nih."
And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.,Arpaksad chun naupasal Sela a nei a; Sela chun naupasal Eber a nei a.
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.,"Eber chun naupasal pahni a nei a: pakhat hming chu Peleg a na, a dam lai chun hnuoi hi ṭhein a um ta sih a, a sang hming chu Joktan a nih."
"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,","Joktan chun naupasal Almodad, Seleph, Hazarmaveth, Jera,"
"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,","Hadoram, Uzal, Dikla,"
"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,","Obal, Abimael, Seba,"
"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.","Ophir, Havila le Jobab a nei a: chuong po po chu Joktan naupasalhai an nih."
"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.","Chun, an umna chu Mesaa inthawkin khawsak tlâng Sephar pan zâwngin a nih."
"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.","Chuonghai chu Sem thlahai chu an nih a, anni hnamhai ang pei le anni ṭawnghai ang peiin, anni ram ramhaiah, anni chihai ang pei chun."
"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.","Chuonghai chu Noa thlahai hnamhai an nih a, an thlahai ang peiin, an chihai lai chun: tui lêt hnungin chuonghaia inthawk chun a nih, hnuoia hin chi tin an indar ta chu."
And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.,"Chun, hnuoia mi po po chu ṭawng hmunkhat le thu hril dân hmunkhat an ni vawng a."
"And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.","Chun, hieng hi a na, khawsak tienga an insawn pei lai chun Sinar ramah phaizâwl an hmuh a; chutaka chun umhmun an khuor tah a."
"And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.","“Thaw ro, ṭêklei siem ei tiu, ṭhatakin rawng ei tiu,” an inti tâwl a. Chuongchun, lung aiah ṭêklei chu an siem a, lungchârna aiah lawnghnai an nei bawk a."
"And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.","Chun, “Thaw ro, khawpui siem ei ta, in insâng a sîpin vân tawng dingin bâwl bawk ei tiu a, ei hming sukthang ei tiu; chuong naw chun hnuoi chung po poa hin sukdarin um rawi ei tih,” an in tih a."
"And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.","Chun, LALPA chu mihriem nauhaiin khawpui le in insâng an siem vêl chu en dingin a zu ṭum a."
"And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.","Chun, LALPA chun, “Ngai ta u, mihai hi pumkhat an nih a, an rêngin ṭawng hmunkhat an nei bawk sih a; hi thil an thaw phut a ni hi; tuhin chu an thilthaw tum hrim hrim hi khappêk ruol ni ta naw ni hai."
"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.","Thaw ro, zu fêng ei tiu a, ṭawng an inhriettuo thei nawna dingin khutaka khun an ṭawng zu suk- tumpêk ei tiu,” a ta."
So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN anni chu chutaka inthawk chun hnuoi chung po poa chun a sukdar tah a; chuongchun, an khaw siem khawm chu an tâwpsan tah a."
Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.,"Chuleichun, a hming chu Babel an tih a; LALPAIN chutaka chun hnuoia mi po po ṭawng chu a suktumpêk ta leiin: chutaka inthawk chun LALPAIN anni chu hnuoi chung po poa chun a sukdar ta bawk a."
"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood:",Hienghai hi Sem thlahai chu an nih: Sem chu kum za mi a niin tui lêt hnung kum hni hnunga chun naupasal Arpaksad a nei a:
"and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.","Chun, Arpaksad a nei hnung chun Sem chu kum za nga a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah:",Arpaksad chun kum sâwmthum le panga a niin naupasal Selah a nei a:
"and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.","Selah a nei hnung chun Arpaksad chu kum za li le pathum a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:",Selah chun kum sâwmthum a niin naupasal Eber a nei a:
"and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.","Eber a nei hnung chun Selah chu kum za li le pathum a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:",Eber chun kum sâwmthum le pali a niin naupasal Peleg a nei a:
"and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.","Peleg a nei hnung chun Eber chu kum za li le sâwmthum a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:",Peleg chun kum sâwmthum a niin naupasal Reu a nei a:
"and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.","Reu a nei hnungin Peleg chu kum za hni le pakuo a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:",Reu chun kum sâwmthum le pahni a niin naupasal Serug a nei a:
"and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.","Serug a nei hnungin Reu chu kum za hni le pasari a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:",Serug chun kum sâwmthum a niin naupasal Nahor a nei a:
"and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.","Nahor a nei hnungin Serug chu kum za hni a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:",Nahor chun kum sâwmhni le pakuo a niin naupasal Tera a nei a:
"and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.","Tera a nei hnungin Nahor chu kum za khat le sâwm le pakuo a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.","Chun, Tera chun kum sâwmsari a niin naupasal Abram, Nahor le Haran a nei a."
"Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.","Chun, hienghai hi Tera thlahai chu an nih. Tera chun naupasal Abram, Nahor le Haran a nei a. Haran chun naupasal Lota a nei a."
"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.","Haran chu a piengna rama Kaldaihai khuo Urah, a pa Tera hmaa chun a thih a."
"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.","Chun, Abram le Nahor chun nuhmei an nei a; Abram nuhmei hming chu Sarai a na; Nahor nuhmei hming chu Milka le Iska pa Haran naunu Milka a nih."
And Sarai was barren; she had no child.,"Chun, Sarai chu a ching a, nau hrim a nei nawh a."
"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.","Tera chun a naupa Abram le, a naupa naupasal (Haran naupa) Lota le, a mo, a naupa Abram nuhmei Sarai chu a ṭhuoi a; Kanaana fe dingin Kaldaihai khuo Ura inthawk chun an suok tlâng tah a; nisienlakhawm, Haran an hung tlung a, chutaka chun umhmun an khuor tah a."
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.,"Tera dam sûng chu kum za hni le panga a nih; chun, Tera chu Harana chun a thi tah a."
"Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee:","Chun, LALPAIN Abram kuoma chun, “I khuoa inthawk le i laibunghai laia inthawk le i pa ina inthawk chu suok la, ram ka lân entir ding che tieng chun fe rawh:"
"and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing:","Chuongchun, chi ropuitakah siem ka ti cheh a, mal khawm sâwm ka ti cheh a, i hming sukropui bawk ka tih: nang malsâwmna nîng i tih."
"and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.","Chun, malsâwmtu che taphawt chu malsâwm ka ta, ṭawngsie inphurtu che chu ṭawngsie inphur ka tih: nangmaa chun hnam tin la thawveng an tih,” a tih a."
"So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.","Chuongchun, Abram chu LALPAIN a kuoma a hril angin a fe tah a; Lota chu ama leh a fe veh a. Abram chu Harana inthawka a suok lai chun kum sâwmsari le panga mi a nih."
"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.","Chun, Abramin a nuhmei Sarai le, a unaupa naupasal Lota le an sum themsuok po po le, Harana an mi neihai chu a ṭhuoi a; Kanaan rama fe dingin an suok a.

"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.","Abram chu chu rama Sekem hmun chen, More thingsaisuo hmun chen chun a fe pei a. Chuong lai chun Kanaan mihai chu chu rama chun an um a."
"And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.","Chun, LALPA chu Abram kuomah ân lâr a, “Hi ram hi i thlahai kuomah la pêng ka tih,” a tih a; chuongchun, chutaka chun a kuoma inlâr LALPA ta ding chun mâichâm a siem a."
"And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.","Chutaka inthawk chun Bethel saktienga tlânga chun ân tâwl a, chutaka chun puon in a zar a, a thlangtieng chun Bethel chu a um a, a sak tieng chun Ai khuo a um a; chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem nâwk a, LALPA hming chu a lam a."
"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.","Chun, Abram chu Negeb panin a lân tâwl ta rawp a."
And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.,"Chun, chu rama chun ṭâm a hung tlah a; chu rama chun ṭâm chu a nasa êm leiin Abram chu Aiguptaa um hri dingin a zu fe tah a."
"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:","Aigupta a lût ding lai chun a nuhmei Sarai kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, nuhmei hmêl ṭhatak i nih ti ka hriet;"
"and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.","chuleiin, Aigupta mihaiin an hmu pha che chun, ‘Hi hi a nuhmei a ni hi,’ tîng an ta, kei chu mi that an ta, nang ruok chu hlâng an ti che."
"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.","I zâra ṭhataka ka um theina ding le, nangma leia ka hring theina dingin, ‘A farnu ka nih,’ ti pei rawh aw,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.","Chun, Abram chu Aigupta a lût chun Aigupta mihai chun nuhmei chu an hmuh a, a hmêl chu ṭha an ti êm êm a."
"And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.","Pharao milienhai khawmin an hmuh a, Pharao kuomah a ṭhatzie an hril a; chuongchun, nuhmei chu Pharao inah an ṭhuoi lût tah a."
"And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.","Chun, ama chun Sarai lei chun Abram chu ṭhatakin a thawh a; chuongchun, berâm dâm, bâwng dâm, sabengtung chal dâm, suokpa dâm, suoknu dâm, sabengtung pui dâm, sanghâwngsei dâm a nei pha tah a."
"And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Abram nuhmei Sarai lei chun Pharao le a sûnghai chu namênin a sawisa ta nawh a."
"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?","Chuongchun, Pharao chun Abram chu a ko a, “Ka chunga i thilthaw hi iengtizie am a ni ta leh? I nuhmei a nih ti iengdinga i mi hril naw am a na?"

"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.","Chun, Abram chu Aiguptaa inthawk chun a suok a, ama le a nuhmei le, a nei po po, ama ruolin Lota leh, Negeb-a chun an hang fe tah a."
"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.","Chun, Abram chu ran dâm, tang- ka dâm, rângkachak dâmin a hausa êm êm a."
"And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,","Chun, Negeba inthawk chun Bethel tlung rakin a fe pei a, Bethel le Ai khuo inkârah, a tîrtaka a puon in umnaa khan;"

"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.","Chun, Lota, Abram le fe ve khawm khan berâm ruol dâm, bâwng ruol dâm, puon in dâm a nei veh a."
"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.","An um rêlna dingin ramin a dai ta nawh a, an thil nei chu a nasa hle sih a; chuongchun, an um hmunkhat thei ta dêr da el a."
And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.,"Chuongchun, Abram ran puhai le Lota ran puhai inkâra chun insêlna a hung suok tah a: chuong lai chun Kanaan le Periz mihai chu chu rama chun an um a."
"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.","Chuongchun, Abramin Lota kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin, kei le nanga inkârah, ka ran puhai le i ran puhai inkâra khawm, insêlna um naw raw se; unau ei ni sih a."
"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.","Ram chu a pumin a um duoi a ni naw am a nih?

"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.","Chuongchun, Lota chu a dâk suok a, Zoar pan zâwng chun, Jordan phaizâwl po po chu LALPA huon ang, Aigupta ram ang khan ram tina tui um furna hmun a nih ti a hriet a, LALPAIN Sodom le Gomorra a suksiet hma kha a ni sih a."
So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.,"Chuongchun, Lota chun Jordan phaizâwl po po chu a thlang tah a; chun, Lota chu saktieng chun ân tâwl tah a: chuongchun, an inṭhe tah a."
"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.","Abram chu Kanaana chun a um a, Lota chu phaizâwl khuohaia chun a um a, a puon in chu Sodom chenin a tâwl pei a."
Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.,"Chun, Sodom mihai chu Pathien mithmuin nasataka ṭha naw le suolin an um a."
"And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:","Chun, a kuoma inthawka Lota a tuma a um hnung chun, LALPAIN Abram kuomah, “Dâk la, i umnaa inthawk khan hmârtieng dâm, sim- tieng dâm, saktieng dâm, thlangtieng dâm en rawh:"

"And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Abram chun a puon in chu a tâwl a, Hebrona um Mamre thingsaisuo kâwlhaia chun umhmun a va khuor a, chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a."

"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.","Kum sâwmpahni sûng chu Kedorlaomer hnuoiah an um a, a kum sâwm pathumnaa chun an hel tah a."
"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,","A kum sâwm palinaa chun Kedorlaomer le a kuoma lal umhai chu an hung a, Asteroth-karnaim khuoah Rephaimhai an that a, Ham khuoah Zuzimhai, Kiriathaim zâwlah Emimhai,"

"And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.","Chun, an kîr nâwk a, En-mispat an tlung a (chu chu Kades a ni tah).

"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;","Chuongchun, Sodom lal, Gomor- ra lal, Adma lal, Zeboiim lal le Bela lal chu an suok a (Bela khuo chu Zoar khuo a ni tah); chun, anni chu thaw dingin Siddim ruoma chun an ṭhang tlat a."

"Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.","Chun, Siddim ruom chu lawng hnâi khurin a sip a; chun, Sodom le Gomorra lalhai chu an tlânseh a, chu- taka chun an tlah a, a tla mahlahai chu tlânga chun an tlân hmang tah a."

"And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.","Lota, Abram unaupa naupa, Sodoma um chu, a sumhai leh an lâk bawk a, an fe tah a."
"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.","Chun, mi pakhat tlânsuok chu a hung a, Hebrai mi Abram chu a hril a; ama chu Amor mi Mamre thingsai- suohai kâwla chun a um a, Mamre chu Eskol le Aner unau a na; chuong mihai chu Abram le ṭhang hmunkhat an nih."

And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.,"Chun, Salem lal Melkizedek chun bei le uoin a hung lâk a; ama chu Pathien Chunghnungtak thiempu a nih."

And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.,"Chun, ama chun LALPA chu a ring a; chuongchun, ama chun chu chu a felnaah a ruotpêk tah a."

"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.","Chun, Abraham chun a naupa Ismael le a ina pieng po po le, a tangka suma a închâwk po pohai le Abraham sûnghai laia mi pasal taphawt chu a ṭhuoi a, Pathienin a kuoma a hril ta ang ngeiin, chu ni ngei chun an ser hmawr vun tisa chu a tanpêk tâwl a."

"And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;","LALPA chun, “Ka thilthaw ding hi Abraham kuoma hin ka ip ding am a ni aw?"

"For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.","LALPA lampui an hraw theina dingin, a hnunga a nauhai le a sûng- hai, thil feltaka thaw ding le rorêl anga thaw dinga thu a pêk theina dingin ama chu ka ruot ta sih a, a chungchâng thu a hril chu LALPAIN Abraham chunga ân tlungtir theina dingin,” a ta."

"And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.","Chun, mihai chu chutaka inthawk chun an inher a, Sodom tieng an pan tah a; Abraham ruok chu LALPA hmaa chun a la ngir zing a."
"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?","Chun, Abraham chun a va hnai a, “Mi felhai chu mi suolhai lai chun i sukbohmang ve ding am a nih?"
Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?,"Khaw sûnga chun mi fel sâwmnga bêk an um el rawi mawh, a sûnga mi fel sâwmnga umhai lei chun khuo chu hla loin i sukbohmang el ding am a nih?"

"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:","Abraham chun, “Ngai ta, kei pilvut le meivâm el hin Lalpa chu ka biek pawp sa ta che chu:"
"peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?

"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there.

"And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:","Vawikhat chu Jakob chun ieng- khat a lo suonghruoi a, Esau chu rama inthawkin a hung a, a châu hleh a."
"and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.","Esau chun Jakob kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin i iengkhat sen suong hruoi kha, kha ngei kha mîn fâktir raw khai, ka ṭâm êm el,” a ta (chuleiin, a hming chu Edom an ti a nih)."

And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:,"Chuongchun, Isak chun Gerara chun umhmun a khuor tah a."
"and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.","Chu khuoa mihai chun a nuhmei chanchin an indawn a; ama chun, “Ka farnu a nih,” a ta: a hmêl a ṭhat leiin, “Hi khuoa mihai hin Rebeka lei hin mi that rawi an tih,” tiin, “Ka nuhmei a nih,” a ti ngam naw a nih."
"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.","Chutaka chun sâwttak a um hnungin, Philistin mihai lal Abimelek chun tukvera inthawkin a hei thlîr a; chun, ngai ta, Isak chun a nuhmei Rebeka chu ân saipui lai a hei hmuh a."
"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.","Chuongchun, Abimelekin Isak chu a ko a, “Ngai ta, i nuhmei a ni ngei hi, iengdinga ‘Ka farnu a nih,’ i ti am a na?” a tih a.

"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.","Abimelek chun, “Kan chunga i thilthaw hi iengtizie am a na?

"And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and Jehovah blessed him.","Chun, Isak chun chu rama chun bu a chîng a, chu kum chun a let za a hmuh a. LALPAIN ama chu mal a sâwm a,"
"And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great:","chuongchun, mi chu a hung hausa ta hleh a, nasataka mi neinung hung ni rau khawpin a hung lien ta duok duok a."
"and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him.","Berâm ruolhai, ran ruolhai a nei a, sûnghai tamtak a nei bawk a; chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun an thîk tah a."
"Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.","A pa Abraham dam laia a siehlawhaiin tuisunsuo an cho po po khawm chu Philistin mihai chun an nel a, pilin an vur bit ta vawng el a."

"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.","Chun, Isak chun a pa Abraham dam laia an tuisunsuo chohai chu a cho nâwk a; Abraham thi hnung khan Philistin mihai chun an lo nel tâwl ta sih a; chun, a pain a lo inbûk ta ang pei khan an hming chu ân bûk a."
"And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.","Isak siehlawhai chun ruomah an cho a, chutaka chun tuisunsuo hnâr nei an hmu ta hlau a."
"And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.","Gerar ranpuhai chun, “Tui hi kan ta a nih,” tiin Isak ranpuhai chu an insêlpui a: chuonga ama leh an insêl leiin tuisunsuo hminga chun Esek ân bûk tah a."

"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.","Chutaka inthawk chu ân tâwl a, tuisunsuo dang a cho nâwk a: chu ruok chu chu lâkpêk tumin an insêlpui ta nawh a: chuongchun, “Tuhin chu LALPAIN hmun lientak a mi siempêk tah a, hi rama hin chi tamtak thla tâng ei tih,” tiin, a hmingah Rehoboth ân bûk a."
And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.,Chutaka inthawk chun Beer- sebaah a hang feh a.

"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.","huon lailung lai taka thing um, chu ra ruok chu Pathienin, ‘in fâk ding a ni nawh a, tâwk khawm in tâwk ding a ni nawh, chuong naw chun thîng in tih,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:","Rûl chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “Thi naw tawp in tih;"

"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun thing ra chu fâk mi a nih ti le, mitlatak a nih ti le, mi sukvar dingin thing ra inhnarumtak a nih ti a hriet chun a ra ṭhenkhat chu a lo a, a fâk tah a; chun a pasal kuoma chun a pêk a, ama khawm chun a fâk tah a."

And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.,"Chun, LALPA Pathien chu zântieng nisa deia huona a hung lêng chu an hriet a: chuongchun, Mihriem le a nuhmei chun huona thing lai chun LALPA Pathien chu an lo inbîksan tah a."

"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.","Mihriem chun, “A mi umpui dinga nuhmei i mi pêk ngei khan thing ra chu a mi pêk a, ka fâk tah a nih,” a ta."

"And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:","Lalpa Pathien chun rûl kuoma chun, “Hieng ang hi i thaw leiin ran po po le ramsa tinrêng laia chun ṭawngsephurin um bîk i ta, bawk- khupin lâwn tâng i ta, i dam sûngin pilvut fa bawk i tih;"

"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;","Chun, Adam kuoma chun, “I nuhmei thu i zâwm a, thing pakhat, ‘A ra i fâk ding a ni nawh,’ tiha thu ka pêk che kha a ra i fâk leiin hnuoi hi nanga leiin ṭawngsephurin a um tah a nih; i dam sûngin inrimtaka sinthawin a ra chu fa tâng i tih;"

And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.,"Chun, mihriem chun a nuhmei chu mi hring po po nu a ni leiin a hmingah Evi ân bûk a."
"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun, Adam ta ding le a nuhmei ta ding chun savun zakawfuolhai a siempêk a, ân hâktir tah a."
"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun, “Ngai ta u, mihriem chu a suol le a ṭha hrein eini laia pakhat ang a hung ni tah a; tuhin chu a kuta banin, hringna thing ra chu loa fain, kumkhuoin hring rawi a tih,” a ta,"
"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.","chuleiin, LALPA Pathienin ama a lâksuokna hnuoi chu inlet dingin Eden huona inthawk chun a tir suok tah a."
"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.","Chuongchun, mihriem chu a hnawt dawk tah a; chun, hringna thing lampui chu vêng dingin Eden huon saktieng panga chun Cherubhai le mei kâwlhnâm inlet tuo zawk zawk chu a sie ta bawk a."

"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.","Bilha chu ân rai a, Jakob chu naupasal a neipêk tah a."

"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.","Ama ruok chun, “Ka pasal i mi lâkpêk hi thil duoi am a nih?

"And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.","Laban chun a kuomah, “I mi lunginsiet thei chun la um phawt ta la, LALPA chun nanga zârah mal a mi sâwm ti aisânin ka hriet i sawnnaw,” a tih a."

"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.","Vawisûn hin i ran ruol chu va en suok vawng ka ta, berâm laia a dumin a rawl le, a dum pheu pheu le, a dum taphawt le, kêl laia a vârin a rawl le, a vârin a rawl pheu pheu chu, chutaka inthawkin ṭhuoi tum ka ta; chun, tuta hnung chu chuong anga um chu ka hlaw ni sienla."
"So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.","Chuongchun, nakie ka hlaw dinghai en dinga i hung pha chun ka felna hin mi dawnpêk el a tih: kêl lai chun a vârin a rawl naw le, a vârin a rawl pheu pheu naw le, berâm laia a dum naw ka kuoma um i hmu taphawt chu ka inrûkah ruot el i tih,” a tih a."

"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;","Chuongchun, chu ni tak chun kêlchal a vâra inzetan le, a vâra rawl pheu pheu po po le, kêlpui a vârin a rawl le, a vârin a rawl pheu pheu po po, a vâr ṭhang taphawt chu be- râm laia a dum po po le chun a ṭhuoi tum a, a naupasalhai kutah a pêk a."

"And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.","Chun, Jakobin hriengzau le almond thing le insething hmawl hring a lâk a, a hâwng a khawk vâr a, hmawlhaia chun a vâr chu a suklang a."
And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.,"A hmawl khawkna hâwnghai chu ran idâwn hlakna tui dâwnna thlênga dâm le, tui luongnaahai chun ran ruol hma peia chun a sieh a: chun, tui dâwn dinga an hung chun an hung inrai phut a."
"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.","Ran ruolhai chu hmawlhai zâwna chun an inrai phut a, a ze intan dâm, a ze chip nuk dâm, ân ze pheu pheu dâmin te an hung nei hlak a."
"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.","Jakob chun berâmtehai chu a sie tum a; ran ruolhai chu Laban ran ruolhai lai a ze intan le a dum po po tieng chu ân nghattir a; ama ran ruolhai chu a sie tum hlak a, Laban ran ruol lai chu a sie nawh a."
"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;","Ran hrât deuhai chu an hung inrai hlima, hmawl lai chun an inrai theina dingin, Jakob chun tui luongnaah, ran ruol mithmua chun hmawlhai chu a sie hlak a."
"but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.","Amiruokchu, ran chu an ṭan a ṭha naw chun a sie ngai nawh: chuongchun, a te ṭanṭha naw deu- hai chu Laban ta a hung ni pei a, a hrât deuhai chu Jakob ta a hung ni pei a."

"And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.","Jakob chun Laban naupa- haiin, “Jakobin ei pa ta po po a lâkpêk vawng a, ei pa taa mi a nih hieng hausakna a nei po po hi,” an ti thuhai a lo hriet a."
"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.","Chuongchun, Jakob chun Laban hmêl chu a en a, hi hma ang khan a chungah a ṭha ta nawh ti a hmuh a."
"And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.","Chun, LALPA chun Jakob kuomah, “I thlatuhai le i laibunghai ramah fe nâwk ta rawh, i kuomah um pei ka tih,” a tih a."
"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,","Chuongchun, Jakob chun mi a tir a, phûla a ran ruol umnaa chun Rakil le Leah chu ân kotir a;"
"and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.","an kuomah, “In pa hmêl ka enin hi hma ang khan ka chungah a ṭha ta nawh ti ka hmuh a; nisienlakhawm, ka pa Pathien chu ka kuomah a um zing a nih."

"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.","Nisienlakhawm, in pa chun a mi hlêm a, ka hlaw hi vawi sâwm lai a mi sukdanglampêk tah a; nisienla- khawm, Pathienin ka pawi a tawk a phal naw a nih."
"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.","A ze irawl nukhai chu i hlaw nîng a tih, a ti leh ran po po chun te, a ze irawl nukhai an nei hlak a; chun ‘A ze itanhai i hlaw nîng a tih,’ a ti leh ran po po chun te a ze itan ruok an nei hlak a."
"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.","Chuong ang chun Pathienin in pa ranhai chu a lâkpêk a, kei a mi pêk tah a ni hi."
"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.","Ranhai an inzâwl hun lai chun ka mangin ka hang dâk a, ran zâwltu a chalhai chu a ze intan dâm, a ze irawl dâm, a ze ṭielṭak dâm, an nih ti ka hmuh a."
"And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.","Chun, ka manga chun Pathien vântirkoin, ‘Jakob,’ a mi hung tih a. Kei chun, ‘Hitaka hi ka um,’ ka tih a."
"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.","Ama chun, ‘Hung dâk la en rawh, ran zâwltu a chalhai po po saw, a ze intan dâm, a ze irawl dâm, a ze ṭielṭak dâm an ni saw: I chunga Laban thilthaw po po hi ka hmu a nih."
"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.","Kei hi lungphuna sahriek i nâlna, a kuoma thu i tiemna, kha Bethel Pathien kha ka nih; tuhin tho la, hi rama inthawk hin suok la, i piengna rama chun fe nâwk ta rawh,’ a tih a,” a ta."
"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?","Rakil le Leah chun an dawn a, a kuomah, “Kan pa ina chun kan ta dingin chanvo le ro inkhâwm ding hrim a la um ta rawp am a nih?"
"Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.","Ama chun ram dang mi ang chauah a mi ngai tah ni lo am a nih? A mi zawr a, kan man khawm a fâk zo vawng ta sih a."
"For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.","Pathienin kan pa kuoma in- thawka sum a lâkpêk po po chu keini le kan nauhai ta a ni hi; chuongchun, Pathienin i kuoma a hril taphawt chu thaw raw khai,” an tih a."
"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;","Chuongchun, Jakob chu a tho a, a naupasalhai le a nuhmeihai chu sanghâwngseihai chungah ân chuongtir a;"
"and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.","chun, Kanaan rama a pa Isak kuoma fe dingin a ran po po le, a sum inkhâwl po po, a ran hmuhai, Paddan-aram rama ân khâwlhai chu a fepui ta vawng a."
Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.,"Laban chu a berâm hmul vaw dingin a fe dai a; chun, Rakil chun a pa milimhai chu ân rûkpêk a;"
"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.","chun, Jakob chu Aram mi Laban hriet naw kârin a fe hmang dai tah a, a tlân hmang ding chu a hril nawh a."
"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.","Chuongchun, a nei po po le chun a tlân hmang tah a; chun, a tho a, Vadungpui chu a kân a, Gilead tlâng tieng chu panin a fe pei tah a."
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.,"Jakob chu a tlân hmang ti, a ni thum niah, Laban an hril a."
"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.","Chuongchun, a unauhai a ṭhuoi a, ni sari lam a hnawt a, Gilead tlânga chun a hnawt phâk tah a."
"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.","Chun, Aram mi Laban kuoma chun zânah a mangah Pathien a hung a, a kuomah, “Jakob kuomah a sie a ṭha, a iengkhawm hril lo dingin fîmkhur rawh,” a tih a."
And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.,"Laban chun Jakob chu a hnawt phâk a.Jakob chun a puon in chu tlânga chun a lo zar tah a; chun, Laban khawm chun a unauhai leh Gilead tlânga chun an zar ve tah a."
"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?","Chun, Laban chun Jakob kuomah, “I thilthaw hi iengtizie am a ni leh? ka hriet naw kâr i fe rûk dai a, kâwlhnâma salmanhai ang ela ka naunuhmeihai i ṭhuoi hmang hi?"
"Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;","Iengdinga inrûka i tlân hmang a, i mîn relrûk san a, hlimna le hla dâm, khuongte le ṭingṭang dâm le kan inthlana ding cheha i mi hril nawh a,"

"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.","Suksethei che ka nih i sawn- naw: nisienlakhawm, i pa Pathien chun zâni zân khan, ‘Jakob kuomah a sie a ṭha iengkhawm hril lo dingin fimkhur rawh,’ tiin a mi biek a nih."
"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?","Chun, i pa in ngai tain fe inhâwk êm êm la khawm, iengdinga ka pathienhai mîn rupêk am i nih a?” a tih a."
"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.","Jakob chun a dawn a, Laban kuomah, “Ka ṭi lei a nih, i nau- nuhmeihai hi mi lapêk rawi i tih, ti ka ṭiha a nih."
"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.","Tukhawm i pathienhai i hmûna chu dam naw ni hai; ei unauhai mithmua hin i ta kan kuoma um chu en chieng la, la ta la,” a tih a. Rakilin a lo inrûk ti Jakob chun a hriet si nawh a."
"And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.","Chun, Laban chu Jakob puon ina dâm, Leah puon ina dâm, suoknuhai pahni puon ina dâm chun a lût pei a; nisienlakhawm, a hmu nawh a. Leah puon ina inthawk chu a suok a, Rakil puon ina chun a lût a."
"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.","Rakil chun milim chu a lâk a, sanghâwngsei thuomhnaw lai chun a lo sieh a, a lo ṭhung deh a. Laban chun a puon in sûng po po chu a dap vêl vawng a, nisienkhawm, a hmu nawh a,"
"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.","chun ama chun a pa kuomah, “I hmah a ka tho pei naw leiin, ka lalpa, lunginsen naw rawh; nuhmei umdân pângngai chu ka chunga a um lai tak a ni sih a,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a zawng a zawng a, milimhai chu a hmu zo ta nawh a."
"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?","Chun, Jakob chu a lunginsen tah a, Laban chu a hal a. Jakob chun Laban kuomah, “Iengam ka bawsiet a, iengam a na ka suolna i mi hung hnawt rak el a?"
"Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.","Ka thuomhnaw po po i dap suok vawng khawmin, i insûng thuom- hnaw hrim iengam i hmu leh? Ka unauhai le i unauhai hmaa hin hung sie suok la, a tu lem am ei indik ngaituo raw hai se."
"These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.","Tuhin kum sâwmhni zet i kuomah ka um tah a, i berâmpuihai le i kêlpuihai chun an têhai an nei suol hrim hrim ngai nawh a, i berâm ruol laia a chalhai khawm ka fâk ngai bawk nawh."
"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.","Ramsa se khawm i kuoma hin ka la hung intlun ngai nawh a, keiin ân hmang ai chu ka tuor lem hlak a, sûna inrûk ni leh, zâna inrûk ni leh ka ithung i phût hlak a."
"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.","Vawi tamtak chu sûna nisa lum le zâna khawdeiin a mi sukrinum êm êm hlak a, îmu khawm ka hmu ngai nawh."
"These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.","Chuong kum sâwmhni sûng po chu i kuomah ka um a, i naunu- hmeihai pahni hlaw dingin kum sâwmpali le, i ranhai hlaw dingin kum ruk i rawng ka bâwl a; ka hlaw hlak chu vawi sâwm lai i sukdanglam sih a."
"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.","Ka pa Pathien, Abraham Pathien, Isak Iṭi chu ka kuomah um naw sienla lem chu, tu khawm hin ruok ngawta mîn fetir ngei ding i ni hi. Pathienin ka rinum tuor le ka rimsikzie chu a hmuh a, zâni zân chun a kâwk che a ni chu,” a tih a."
"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?","Chun, Laban chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Naunuhmeihai hi keia nauhai an nih a, naupanghai hi keia naupanghai an nih a, ranhai hi keia ran an nih a, i hmu po po hi keia ta vawng an nih: vawisûn hin hieng ka naunuhmeihai chunga le an nauhai chunga hin iengam thaw thei ka ti leh?"
"And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.","Hung ta, kei le nang hin thu thlung ei tih, chu chu kei le nanga kâra hrietna ni raw se,” a tih a."
"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.","Chuongchun, Jakob chun lung a lâk a, lungphun dingin a phun a."
"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.","Chun, Jakobin a unauhai kuom- ah, “Lung la khâwm ro,” a tih a; chun, lung an lâk a, an intieng khâwm a; chun, lung intieng khâwm kâwla chun bu an fâk a."
And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.,Laban chun chu lung intieng khâwm chu Jegar-sahadutha ân bûk a; Jakob ruok chun Galeed ân bûk a.
"And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:","Laban chun, “Hi lung intieng khâwm hi vawisûn hin kei le nanga kâra hrietpuitu a ni hi,” a tih a. Chuleiin, a hminga chun Galeed inbûk a ni tah a."
"and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.","Mizpah inbûk a ni bawk a, “Inṭheha ei um hnungin LALPA chun mi vêng tuo raw se."
"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.","Ka naunuhmeihai hi i sukrim- sih a, ka naunuhmeihai ni lo nuhmei dang i nei chun, tukhawm ei kuoma hin an um nawha chu, en ta, Pathien chu kei le nanga kâra hretu a nih,” a tih a."
"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.","Laban bawk chun Jakob kuomah, “Hi lung intieng khâwm hi en la, kei le nanga kâra hi lung ka phun khawm hi en ta."
"This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.","Pawi intâwkpêk dingin, keiin hi lung intieng khâwm hi khêlin i kuom tieng hung naw ningah a, ti le, nang khawmin hi lung intieng khâwm le hi lungphun hi khêlin ka kuom tieng hung naw ti nih, ti hi lung intieng khâwm hi hrietna ni sienla, hi lungphun khawm hi hrietna ni bawk raw se."
"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.","Abraham Pathien, Nahor Pathien, an pa Pathien chun ei kâra thu ngaituo raw se,” a ti nâwk a. Chun Jakob chun a pa Isak Iṭi chu sâlin ṭawng ân khâm tah a:"
"And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.","Chun, Jakobin tlânga chun inthawina ân hlân a, a unauhai chu bei fa dingin a ko a; chuongchun, bei an fâk a, tlânga chun an riek tah a."
"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.","Chun, zingkâr Laban chu a tho a, a tuhai le a naunuhmeihai chu a fâwp a, mal a sâwm a; chun, Laban chu a feh a, ama umna tieng a kir nâwk tah a."
"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.","Jakob chu a fe ta pei a; chun, Pathien vântirkohaiin an lo intuokpui a."
"And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.","Jakobin anni a hmu chun, “Hieng hi Pathien pâwlhai an nih,” a tih a; chuongchun, chu hmun hminga chun Mahanaim ân bûk a."
"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.","Chun, Jakob chun Seir rama Edom phûl tienga a u Esau kuoma chun a hmaah zuolkohai ân tlântir a."
"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:","“Ka lalpa Esau kuoma chun hieng ang hin in hril ding a nih, ‘I siehlaw Jakobin hieng ang hin a ti a nih: Laban kuoma chun mikhuol ka nih a, tu chen hin ka um ta zing a."
"and I have oxen, and asses, and flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.","Bâwngchal dâm, sabengtung le berâm dâm, suoknu le suokpa dâm ka nei bawk a, i lunginsietna ka hmu theina dingin, ka lalpa hril dingin mi ka hung tir a nih,’ a tih,” tiin, thu a pêk a."
"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.","Chun, zuolkohai chu Jakob kuomah an hung kîr nâwk a, “I u Esau kuom kan va tlung a, mi za li hung ṭhuoiin a tuok ding chein a hung nghe nghe annaw,” an tih a."
"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;","Chuongchun, Jakob chu a ṭi êm êm a, a lunginzîng tah a; chun, a kuoma mi umhai dâm, berâm ruol le bâwng ruol dâm, sanghâwngseihai dâm chu pâwl hniin a siem a:"
"and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.",Esau chu pâwl khatah a hunga a that khawmin pâwl khat la um chu tlân hmang thei an tih ti a ngaituoh a.
"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:","Chun, Jakob bawk chun, “Aw ka pu Abraham Pathien, ka pa Isak Pathien, aw LALPA, ‘I ram tieng le i laibunghai lai fe nâwk ta rawh, chuongchun, siem ṭhâng ka ti che’ mi titu,"
"I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.",i siehlaw chunga lunginsietna po po în langtir le thutak po po în langtir laia a chîntak khawm hi hmu tlâk ka ni nawh; hi Jordan hi ka hmawl le bak ka kân a; tuhin chu pâwl hni zet ka lo ni ta hi.
"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.","Lunginsiettakin ka u kuta inthawk, Esau kuta inthawk ngei chu mi sanhim rawh, nunau puma a mi hung that ka ṭi sih a."
"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.","Nangin, ‘Siem ṭha ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, i thlahai chu tuisuorieta phaiphin tiem sênglo khawp raua tam angin siem ka ti che,’ i ti sih a,” a tih a."
"And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:","Chun, chu zân chun chutaka chun a riek tah a; chun, a thil nei laia mi a u Esau ta dingin lâwmman dingin a sie tum a;"
"two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,","kêlpui za hni le kêlchal sâwm- hni, berâmpui za hni le berâmchal sâwmhni,"
"thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.","sanghâwngsei sâwrlai sâwm- thum an tehai leh, bâwngpui sâwmli le bâwngchal sâwm, sabengtungpui sâwmhni le sabengtungchal sâwm leh."
"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.","Chun, chuonghai chu pâwl tin a tum sengin a siehlawhai kutah ân kawltir a: chun, a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Ka hmaah fe kai unla, pâwl tin hi kâr inneitir pei ro,” a tih a."
"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?","A hmaṭhuoitu kuoma chun hieng hin thu a pêk a, “Ka u Esau chun ân tuokpui cheh a, ‘Tu mi am i nih a? Khâwlaia fe ding am? I hmaa umhai hi tu ta am?’ tiha ân dawn pha che chun,"
"then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.","‘I siehlaw Jakob ta an nih, pu Esau, i ta dingin lâwmmana ân phur che a ni hi: ama khawm kan hnungah a um’ ti rawh,” tiin."
"And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;","A dawttu le, a dawt nâwktu le ran ruol khaltuhai po po kuoma khawm, “Esau in hmu pha chun chuong ang tak chun in hril ding a nih."
"and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.","‘Chun, ngai ta, i siehlaw Jakob chu kan hnunga sawn a um,’ ti bawk unla,” tiin thu a pêk seng a. “Lâwmman ka hmaa fe hin a lung sukdam ka ta, chu hnunga chun a hmêl hmûng ka tih; chuongchun, mi lo lâwm el a tih,” a ti a nih."
So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.,"Chuongchun, lâwmman chu a hmaa chun a fe kai tah a, ama ruokchu chu zân chun a pâwl lai chun a riek tah a."
"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.","Chu zân chun a tho a, a nuhmeihai pahni le, a suoknuhai pahni le, a nau sâwm le pakhathai chu a ṭhuoi a, Jabbok vadung kaia chun a kai tah a."
"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.","Chuongchun, anni chu a ṭhuoi a, vadung chu ân kaitir a, a nei po po khawm ân kaitir bawk a."
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.,"Chun, Jakob chu ama khât bakin a um tah a; chun, mi pakhatin ama chu khawfingchat chenin a buon a buon a."
"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.","A hne nawh ti ân hrietin a êlpui ru suktuona lai hi a khîk pêk a; chuongchun, a buon lai chun Jakob êlpui ru insuktuokna chu a hung inpelsawl tah a."
"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.","Chun, mi chun, “Mîn thla rawh, khawfing khawm a chat ding a ni ta hi,” a tih a. Jakob chun, “Mal i mi sâwm naw chun inthla naw ning che,” a tih a."
"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.","Chun, mi chun a kuomah, “I hming iem a na?” a tih a. Ama chun, “Jakob,” a tih a."
"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.","Chun, mi chun, “I hming chu Jakob ti ta naw ni hai a, Israel ti lem tâng an ti che; Pathien le mihriem i thawh a, i hne ta sih a,” a tih a."
"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.","Chun, Jakobin ama chu ân dawn a, “Lunginsiettakin i hming mi hril rawh,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Iengleia ka hming indawn am i nih a?” a tih a. Chun, chutaka chun mal a sâwm tah a."
"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.","Chun, Jakobin chu hmun hminga chun Peniel ân bûk tah a, “Pathien chu a hmaihma ngeiah ka hmuha chu ka hringna hi hla a ni sih a,” tiin."
"And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.","Chun, Peniel a suoksan lai tak chun nisa a hung suok a, ama chu a hung khawh a, a êlpui lei chun ân bâi tah a."
"Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.","Chuleiin, tu chen hin Israel thlahai chun êlpui ru suktuoha ke tha um hi an fâk ngai nawh: Jakob êlpui ru suktuo chu a ke tha laitaka a khîk leiin."
"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.","Chun, Jakob chu a hang dâk a, a thlîr a, Esau, a mi za lihai le hung chu a hmuh a. Chuongchun, a nauhai chu Leah kuoma dâm, Rakil kuoma dâm, suoknuhai pahni kuoma dâm a sem diet diet a."
"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.","Suoknuhai le an nauhai chu a hmatâwng takah, Leah le a nauhai chu a dawtah, Rakil le Josef chu a nuhnung takah a sieh a."
"And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.","Ama chu an hmaa chun a feh a, a unaupa kuom tieng pana a fe chun a kuom a tlung hmain, vawisari hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk hman a."
"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.","Chun, Esau chu ama lâwm dingin a tlân a, a kuoh a, a ir a suktuoh a, a fâwp a; chun, an ṭap ve ve tah a."
"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.","Esau chu a hang dâk a, nuhmeihai le naupanghai chu a hmuh a, “I ṭhuoihai hi tuhai am an nih a?” a tih a. Ama chun, “Pathienin lunginsiettaka i siehlaw kuoma a pêk naupanghai an ni hi,” a tih a."
"Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.","Chuongchun, suoknuhai chu an nauhai le chun an hung hnai a, an kûn a,"
"And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.","Leah khawm a nauhai le chun an hung hnai a, an kûn a; chu hnunga chun Rakil le Josef chu an hung hnai a, an kûn veh a."
"And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.","Esau chun, “Ran ruol ka întuokpui zozaihai kha ieng i tina am a nih a?” a tih a. Jakob chun, “Ka lalpa, i lunginsietna ka hmu theina dingin ka ti a nih,” a tih a."
"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.","Chun, Esau chun, “Kei khawmin ka hau ie, ka sangpa, i nei po po chu i ta ni raw se,” a tih a."
"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.","Jakob chun, “Ni lo e, i mi lunginsiet thei chun lunginsiettakin ka lâwmman hi mi pawmpêk rawh: Pathien hmêl hmu angin i hmêl ka hmuh a, ka chungah i lâwm sih a."
"Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.","Pathienin a mi lunginsiet a, ka nei ṭeu leiin lunginsiettakin ka thil hung pêk che hi chu pawm rawh,” a tih a. Chuong ang chun a thlêm a, ama chun a pawm tah a."
"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.","Chun, Esau chun, “Hung rawh fêng ei tih, hma ṭhuoi pêk ka ti che,” a tih a."
"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.","Jakob chun a kuomah, “Nau- panghai hi an la chîn a, berâm ruol le ran ruol ka kuoma umhai khawm hi te ṭhuoi an nih ti ka lalpain i hriet a; ni khat chau khawm khal hrât taluo inla, ran ruol po po hi thi vawng el an tih."
"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.","Ka lalpa, lunginsiettakin i siehlaw hmaa hin fe la, kei chu Seir tlângah ka lalpa kuom ka tlung hmakhat chu, ka hmaa ran fe hi an fe thei tâwk ang peiin le, naupanghai fe thei tâwk ang peiin, damtein hung sawm lem ka tih,” a tih a."
"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.","Chun, Esau chun, “Ka kuoma um mi ṭhenkhathai bêk hi mâksan- pêk ka ti che aw,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Iengding kherin am ie? ka lalpa, i lunginsietna mîn hmutir el rawh,” a tih a."
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.,"Chuongchun, Esau chu chu ni ma chun Seir tlâng tieng panin a kîr nâwk tah a."
"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.","Chun, Jakob chu Sukkoth-ah a feh a, ama ta dingin in a bâwl a, a ranhai ta dingin bûk a bâwl bawk a; chuleiin, chu hmun hming chu Sukkoth an ti tah a."
"And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.","Chun, Jakob chu Paddan-aram rama inthawka hungin, Kanaan rama um Sekem khuo chu himtakin a tlung a, khawhnâwma chun a puon in a zar tah a."
"And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.",A puon in zarna hmun chu Sekem pa Hamor nauhaia inthawkin tangka zain ân châwk a.
"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.","Chutaka chun mâichâm a siem a, a hmingah El-elohe-Israel ân bûk a."
"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.","Chun, Leah naunu Dina, Jakob a neipêk chu, chu ram nunghâkhai hmu dingin a va lêng suok a."
"And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.","Chun, Hiv mi Hamor, chu ram lal naupa Sekem chun ama chu a lo hmuh a; a man a, a zâlpui a, ân tlâwm tah a."
"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.","Chun, a lungril chu Jakob naunu Dina chunga chun a um tlat a, chu nunghâk chu a hmangai a, bau ṭhatakin a biek a."
"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.","Sekem chun a pa Hamor chu a biek a, “Chu nunghâk chu nuhmeiin mi neipêk rawh,” a tih a."
Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.,"Jakob chun a naunu Dina chu Sekem chun a sukkhawhlo ti a lo hriet a, nisienlakhawm, a naupa- salhai chu phûlah ran lai an um leiin an hung hmakhat chu a to zing a."
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.,Sekem pa Hamor chu Jakob be dingin a kuomah a feh a.
"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.","Jakob naupasalhai chun an hriet phingleh phûla inthawk chun an hung a; chun, Jakob naunu zâlpuiin Israelhai laiah thil suol invêtthlâk- tak, thil thaw dêr lo ding chu a thaw ta leiin an lungngai a, an lunginsen ta êm êm a."
"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.","Hamor ruok chun anni a biek a, “Ka naupa Sekem lungril chu in naunu chungah a um tlat a: lungin- siettakin nuhmeiin inneitir ta unla."

"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.","Chun, Jakobin Simeon le Levi kuoma chun, “Nangnîn hi rama um Kanaan mihai le Periz mihai laia hin, theida in mîn phurtirin in mi suklungzîng hle a nih; kei tlâwmte ka ni leiin mi thaw dingin hung inpun khâwm an ta, mi that el an tih; chuongchun, sukbohmangin um ka tih, kei le ka sûnghai le hin,” a tih a."

And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.,"Chun, a uhai chun ama chu an îtthîk a, a pa ruok chun a thuhril chu lungrilin a vawn zing a."
And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.,"Chun, a uhai chu Sekema chun an pa ran ruol chu inthlain an feh a."
"And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.","Israel chun Josef kuomah, “I uhaiin Sekemah a ni maw ran ruol chu an inthla? hung ta, an kuomah tir ka ti che,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Mi tir ta la,” a tih a."
"And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.","A pa chun a kuomah, “I uhai an dam am, ran ruol khawm an dam am va en la, an chanchin mi hung hril nâwk rawh aw,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Hebron ruoma inthawk chun a tir suok a; ama chun Sekem chu a va tlung tah a."
"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?","Chun, mi tuin amanih phûla ân vâk ân vâk lai chun a hmuh a; chuongchun, mi chun, “Iengam i zawng leh?” tiin ân dawn a."
"And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.","Ama chun, “Ka uhai ka zawng a nih: lunginsiettakin ran ruol an inthlâna chu mi hril ta khai,” a tih a."
"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.","Mi chun, “Hitaka inthawkin an suok kha tie, ‘Dothanah fêng ei tiu,’ an ti chu ka hriet,” a tih a. Chun, Josef chun a uhai chu a hnawt a, Dothana chun a va hmuh a."
"And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.","Anni chun hlataka inthawkin an lo hmuh a, an kâwl hnai a tlung hmain ama thatna ding thu an lo rawt tah a."
"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.","“En ta u, mang neipa a hung saw."
"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.","Thaw ro, that ei ta, khur pakhatah thlâk ei tiu khai; chun, ‘Sain a se tah,’ ei ti el ding annâwm: chuongchun, a manghai chu ieng- tin am a um hre el ei tih,” an inti tâwl a."
"And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.","Reuben ruok chun chu chu a lo hrietin an kuta inthawk chun a sansuok a, “A that êm chu that nâwng ei tiu,” a tih a."
"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.","Reuben bawk chun a pa kuoma ṭhuoi nâwkna dinga an kuta inthawk chu a sansuok theina dingin, an kuoma chun, “Thisen chu insuo naw ro, thlalêra khura hin thlâk unla, kut chu a chunga hin thlâk naw ro,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;","Chun, Josef chun a uhai kuom a va tlung chun, ama chu a zakawfuol rawng tamtaka ṭiel a ihâk chu an lo hlîppêk a;"
"and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.","an ṭhuoi a, khurah an thlâk tah a: khur chu a ruok tui um nawna a nih."
"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.","Chun, bu fa dingin an hang ṭhung tâwl a; chun, an hang dâk a, Ismael inzinpâwl Gileada inthawk an sanghâwngseia riminhnik, thing hnai damdawi le murra phura Aiguptaa zu fe ding hunghai chu an hmuh a."
"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?","Chun, Juda chun a unauhai kuomah, “Ei sang ei that a, a thisen suok ei ip chun iengam ṭhathnemna um a ta?"
"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.","Thaw ro, a chungah kut thlâk loin Ismael mihai kuoma sawn zawr el lem ei tiu; ama hi ei sang, ei tisa ngei a ni sih a,” a tih a. A unauhai chun a thu chu an zâwm tah a."
"And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.","Chun, Midian mihai sumdâwng an hung a; chuongchun, Josef chu khura inthawk chu an khai suok a, Ismael mihai kuoma chun Josef chu tangka sawmhniin an zawr tah a, anni chun Josef chu Aiguptaah an ṭhuoi tah a."
"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.","Reuben chu khura chun a hung kîra Josef chu khurah a lo um ta nawh ti a hmu chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a,"

"And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;","Chun, Josef zakawfuol chu an lâk a, kêlchal an thata a thia chun zakawfuol chu an inchieh a."
"and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son’s coat or not.","Chun, zakawfuol chu an inphur a, an pa kuoma chun an hung chawi a, a kuomah, “Hi hi kan hmu ringawt a, i naupa zakawfuol a ni am a ni naw en ta,” an tih a."
"And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.","Ama chun a lo hriet el a, “Ka naupa zakawfuol a ni hi, sahrângin a se tah a ni hi aw, Josef chu matheiloin keinawi nengin a um ni ngei a tih,” a tih a."
"And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.","Chun, Jakob chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, saiip puon a dierkei a, ni sâwttak a naupa chu a sûn a."
"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.","A naupasalhai po po le a nau- nuhmeihai po po chu ama thlamuon dingin an tho a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun thlamuon a nuom nawh a, “Ni lo, lusûn pumin thlânah ka naupa kuomah ka fe ding a nih,” a tih a.

"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.","Chun, Midian mihai chun Josef chu Aiguptaah Pharao hnuoia hotu pakhat, vêngtu pâwl hotu Potiphar kuoma chun an zâwr a."
"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.","Chuong lai chun hieng hi a nih a, Juda chu a unauhai laia inthawk chu a fe thlah a, Adullam mi pakhat a hming Hira chu a zu bêl tah a."
"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.","Juda chun chutaka chun Kanaan mi pakhat a hming Sua naunu a hmuh a, ama chu a neia a pâwl tah a."
"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.","Chuongchun, ân rai a, naupasal a nei a; chun, Juda chun a hmingah Er a sak a."
"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.","Chun, ân rai nâwk a, naupasal a nei nâwk a; chun, a nuin a hmingah Onan a sak a."
"And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.","Chun, naupasal a nei nâwk a, a hmingah Selah a sak a: chu chu a nei lai chun Juda chu Chezib-ah a um a."
"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.","Juda chun a nau lutîr Er chu nuhmei a neipêk a, a hming chu Tamar a nih."
"And Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah slew him.","Nisienlakhawm, Juda nau lutîr Er chu LALPA mithmuah mi suol a nih a, LALPAIN ama chu a sukhlum tah a."
"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.","Chun, Juda chun Onan kuomah, “I u nuhmei chu pâwl la, pasalhai unau thaw ding chu thawpêk la, i u ta ding chun chi thlapêk rawh,” a tih a."
"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.","Nisienlakhawm, Onan chun chithla ding chu ama thla a ni naw ding a nih ti a hriet a; chuongchun, a u nuhmei a pâwl po leh a u ta dinga chi thlapêk lo dingin a chi chu hnuoiah a sukthlâk hlak a."
And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.,"A thilthaw chu LALPA mithmua chun suoltak a nih; chuleiin, ama khawm chu a sukhlum tah a."
"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.","Juda chun a monu Tamar kuoma chun, “Ka naupa Selah hi a puitling hmakhat chu i pa in tieng pasal nei loin lo um phawt rawh,” a tih a. “Chuong naw chun ama khawm hi a uhai angin thi rawi a tih,” a ti a nih. Chuongchun, Tamar chu a pa in tieng chun a va um tah a."
"And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.","Chun, a nakie chun Sua naunu, Juda nuhmei chu, a thih a; chun, a ngai a hung bo a, Timnaa berâm hmul vawtuhai kuom tieng chun ama le a ruolpa Adullam mi Hira chu an hang feh a."
"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.","Chun, Tamar chu, “I tarpupa chu a berâm hmul vaw dingin Timnaah a hang fe ding a nih,” ti hril a nih a."
"And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.","Ama chun a pasal sûnna silfênhai chu a hlîp a, inkhumna puonin ân khum a, ân tuom tlat a, Timna lampuia Enaim kul kawt- khâra chun a lo ṭhung a: Selah chu a puitling ta sih a, a pa chun a nuhmei dingin ân neitir naw zo a ni tah ti a hriet sih a."
"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face.","Chun, Judain ama chu a hmuin nawchizawr amanih a sâwn a, a hmai chu ân khum tlat sih a."
"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?","Chuongchun, lampui sîra nu- hmei tieng chu a va pan a, “Hung ta, lunginsiettakin zâl hmunkhat ei tih,” a tih a; a mo kha a nih ti a hriet si nawh a.

"And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?","Ama chun, “Ran ruol laia kêlte inphur ka ti che,” a tih a. Chun, ama chun, “Chu chu i mi hung inphur hmaa lo hrên ding iemani bêk i mi pêk ding?” a tih a."
"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.","Ama chun, “Hrên ding ieng am pêng ka ti cheh a?” a tih a. Amanu chun, “I hming namna le i hrui, i hmawl chawi le khan,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a pêk a, a zâlpui tah a; chun, amaa inthawk chun nau a vawn tah a."
"And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.","Chun, a tho a, a inkhumna puon chu a hlîp a, a hmeithaina silfênhai chu ân bel nâwk tah a."
"And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.","Chun, Judain a thil hrên chu nuhmei kuta inthawk la dingin a ruolpa Adullam mi kutah kêlte chu ân phur a, nisienlakhawm, ama chun a va hmu zo nawh a."
"Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.","Chuongchun, nuhmei umna laia mihai kuoma chun, “Lampui sira Enaima nawchizawr um kha khaw lai am a um ta leh?” tiin ân dawn a. Anni chun, “Nawchizawr hrim hitaka hin an um nawh ie,” an tih a."
"And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here.","Chuongchun, Juda kuoma chun a kîr nâwk a, “Ama chu ka hmu zo nawh, a hmuna mihai khawmin, ‘Nawchizawr hrim hitaka hin an um nawh,’ an lo ti bawk a,” a tih a."
"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.","Juda chun, “Nei sawng el raw se, chuong naw chun muolpho rawi ei tih, en ta, hi kêlte hi kân phur a, ama i hmu zo si nawh a,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.","Thla thum vêl amani hnunga chun Juda chu, “I monu Tamar chun tlangvâl a dit a, chunawa khawm, ngai ta, sâwn a pai nghe nghe annaw,” tiha hril a nih a. Juda chun, “Ṭhuoi suok unla, raw hlumin um raw se,” a tih a."
"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.","Chun, an ṭhuoi suok chun Tamar chun, “Hi thil neitupaa inthawk hin a nih nau ka vawn chu,” tiin, a tarpupa kuoma chun mi a tir a; ama bawkin, “Lunginsiettakin hieng hming namna hai, hrui hai, hmawl hai hi tu ta am a nih en chieng ta khai,” a ti bawk a."
"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.","Juda chun chuong thil chu ama ta a nih ti a hriet a, “Ama chu keia nêkin a fel lem a nih, ama chu ka naupa Selah chu kân neitir ta si nawh a,” a tih a.

"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.","Chun, nauhain a se laiin, ngai ta, a sula chun inphîr an lo um a."
"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.","A nau pakhat chun a kut a hung pur dawk a; chuongchun, nau dawm mi chun, “Hi hi a suok hmasa lem a ni hi,” tiin a chel a, a kuta chun pat sen ân buntir a."
"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore his name was called Perez.","A kut chu a kei lût nâwk lai chun, ngai ta, a unau chu a hung suok tah a; chuongchun, nau dawmtu chun, “Iengdinga suokna ding insiem am i nih a?” a tih a, chuleiin, a hmingah Perez an sak a."
"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.","Chu hnunga chun a unau pat sen bun kha a hung suok ve a, a hmingah Zera an sak a."
"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.","Josef chu Aiguptaah an ṭhuoi thlâk a; chun, Pharao hnuoia hotu pakhat, vêngtu pâwl hotu Aigupta mi Potiphar chun, chutaka hung ṭhuoi thlatu Ismael mihai kuta inthawk chun ân châwk a."
"And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.","LALPA chu Josef kuomah a um a; chuongchun, ama chu mi hlawtling- tak a hung ni tah a, a pu Aigupta mi ina chun a um a."
"And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.","A pu chun LALPA chu a kuom- ah a um a, a thilthaw taphawt LALPAIN a kutah ân hlawtlingtir ti a hmuh a."
"And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.","Chuongchun, Josef chun a pu lunginsietna a hlawh a, ama rawng- bâwltuah a um a; chun, ama chu a sûnghai chunga hotuah a siem a, a nei po po a kutah a sie ta vawng a."
"And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.","A ina hotua a siem a, a nei po po chunga hotua a siem chena inthawk chu Josef leiin LALPA chun Aigupta mi sûng khat chu mal a sâwm tah a; in tieng le ram tienga a nei po po chu LALPAIN mal a sâwm a."
"And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.","Chuongchun, a nei po po chu Josef kutah a sie tlat a, a kuoma thil um hrim hrim chu a hrietpui dêr nawh a, ama bufâk bak naw chu.

"And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.","Chuong hnunga chun hieng hi a nih a, a pu nuhmei chun Josef chu dit enin a en a, “Mi zâlpui rawh,” a tih a."
"But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:","Ama ruok chu a nuom nawh a, a pu nuhmei kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, ka pu chun hi ina hin ka kuomah ieng ieng am a um a hriet si nawh a, a nei po po chu ka kutah a sie vawng a;"
"he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?","hi ina hin keia nêka lien lem tukhawm an um nawh a: a nuhmei i ni leiin nang bak naw chu ka ta dingin iengkhawm inro a nei bawk nawh: chuleiin, iengtin am hi suol lientak hi thawin Pathien chungah thil suksuol thei ka ti leh?” a tih a."

"And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.","Nisienlakhawm, ni khat chu, a sin chu thaw dinga in sûnga a va lût lai, chu ina mi tukhawm hrim an um naw lai chun,"

"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,","Chun, a silfên chu a kuta mâksanin a tlân suok tah ti a hriet phingleh,"
"that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:","ama-nu chun a ina umhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “En ta u, a mi sukmuolpho dingin Hebrai mi pakhat ei kuomah a ṭhuoi lût ta hi; mi zâlpui tumin ka kuomah a hung lût a, chuongchun, râwl inringtakin ka khêk a;"

"And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.","Chun, Josef pu a hung hmakhat chu a silfên chu a kâwlah a lo sie zing a."

"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;","Hnuoi, i kuta inthawka i sang thisen dawng dinga a bâu lo katua inthawkin ṭawngsephur i ni tah,"
"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.","hnuoi în let pha khawm a ṭhatna chu pe phal ta naw ni che; hnuoia hin tlânhmang le invai hung ni tâng i tih,” a ta."
"And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.","Chun, Kaina chun LALPA kuomah, “I mi hremna hi a nasa bêk a, tuor zo naw ning."
"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.","Ngai ta, nangin vawisûn hin hnuoi chunga inthawkin i mi hnawt- hmang ta sih a; i mithmua inthawk thuphmangin ka um ding a ni tah a; hnuoia hin tlânhmang le invai ka lo ni ta ding a ni sih a, chuleiin, a mi hmu taphawtin mi that el an tih,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.","LALPA chun a kuomah, “Chuong a ni chun tukhawm Kaina thattu chu a let sariin a chungah phuba lâk nîng a tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, mîn an hmu a, an that nawna dingin LALPAIN Kaina chu ân chik tah a."
"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.","Chuongchun, Kaina chu LALPA kuoma inthawk chu a suok tah a. Eden sak tienga Nod ramah a um tah a."
"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.","Kaina chun a nuhmei a pâwl a, chuongchun, ân rai a, Enok a nei a; chun, khuo a siem a, a khaw hminga chun a naupa hming chawiin Enok a sak a."
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.,Enok chun Irad a nei a; Irad chun Mehujael a nei a; Mehujael chun Methusael a nei a; Methusael chun Lamek a nei a.
"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.","Lamek chun nuhmei pahni a nei a, pakhat hming chu Ada a nih a, pakhat hming chu Zila a nih."
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.,"Ada chun Jabal a nei a, ama chu puon ina um ran vaituhai thlatu a nih."
And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.,"A sang hming chu Jubal a na, ama chu ṭingṭang le theihle mûttuhai po po thlatu a nih."
"And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.","Zila khawm chun Tubal-kaina, dâr le thîr hriemhrei tinrêng suttu, a nei a; chun Tubal-kaina farnu chu Naama a nih."
"And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:","Lamek chun a nuhmeihai kuoma chun, “Ada le Zilla hai, ka rawl hre unla; Lamek nuhmeihai, ka thu hril hi ngai ro: Sukhliema ka um leiin mi ka that a, Vuok thitlinga ka um leiin tlangvâl ka that a nih:"
"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.","Kaina phuba hman a let saria lâk a ni ding chun, Lamek phuba lem chu a let sâwmsari le pasariin lâk ni ngei a tih,” a ta."
"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, said she, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.","Chun, Adam chun a nuhmei chu a pâwl nâwk a; chuongchun, ama chun naupasal a nei nâwk a, a hmingah Seth a sak a: “Pathienin Abel aiah chi thla dang a mi ruotpêk tah; Kaina chun ama a that ta sih a,” a tih a."
"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.","Chun, ama, Seth ngei khawm chun naupasal a nei tah a; a hmingah Enos a sak a; chuong lai chun mihai chun LALPA hming chu an hung lam ṭan tah a."
"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.",Chuong thil hnunga chun Aigupta lal uoin petu le a bei siemtu chun an pu Aigupta lal chu an suklungninawh a.
"And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.","Chuongchun, Pharao chu a siehlaw pahni, a uoin pe hotu tak le, a bei siem hotu tak chunga chun a lunginsen tah a."
"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.","Chuongchun vêngtu pâwl hotu inah, intângna in, Josef khuopa a umnaa chun, ân tângtir tah a."
"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.","Vêngtu pâwl hotu chun Josef chu anni ân enkawltir a: chuongchun, ama chun anni chu a nghâk a, an rawng a bâwl tah a: chun, ni iengzat lai amanih an intâng phawt a."
"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.","Chun, intângna ina khuopa um, Aigupta lal uoin petu le bei siemtu chun, an pahniin zân khatah mang umze tum ve ve an nei a."
"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.","A zînga zîngkâr chun Josef chu an kuomah a va lût a, anni chu lungngai hmêl deuin a va hmuh a."
"And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in ward in his master’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?","Chun, ama chun, “Iem a tiha vawisûn chu lungngai hmêl in va put de?” tiin, Pharao siehlaw hotuhai, a pu ina ama kuoma intâng vehai chu ân dawn a."
"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Mang kan nei a, a mi hrilfie thei tukhawm an um si nawha a nih,” an tih a. Josef chun an kuomah, “Mang hrilfienahai chu Pathien ta a ni naw am a nih? Lunginsiettakin mi hang hril ta u,” a tih a."
"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;","Chuongchun, uoin pe hotu tak chun a mang chu Josef a hril a, a kuomah, “Ka manga chun ka hmaa hin grêp hrui a lo um a,"
"and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:","grêp hruia chun a kau pathum a um bawk a; chun, inder suok angin a lo um a, pârhai a lo hung suok a: a pâr bâwrhai chun grêp hminhai a hung insuo tah a."
"and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.","Chun, Pharao no chu ka kuta hin a lo um a; chuongchun, grêp rahai chu ka lo a, Pharao noa chun ka sâwr a, no chu Pharao kutah ka lo pêk a,” a tih a."
"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;","Josef chun a kuomah, “Hi hi a hrilfiena a nih: a kau pathum chu ni thum a nih."
"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.","Tuta inthawk ni thuma chun Pharaoin i lu dawm kâng a ta, i sinthaw chu inthawtir nâwk a ti che: chuongchun, a uoin petu i ni laia i pêk dân pângngai ang khan Pharao no chu a kutah i pêk nâwk ding a ni chu."
"But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:","Amiruokchu, i chan ṭhat nâwk pha chun mi hung hre zing la, lungin- siettakin lunginsietna ka chungah hung inlangtir la, Pharao kuomah ka chanchin hung hril la, hi ina inthawk hin mi ṭhuoi suok rawh."
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.,"Hebrai mihai rama inthawka miin ân rûka an mîn rûk hmang ka nih a, hi rama khawm hin rip sûnga an mi khumna khawp iengkhawm ka suksuol nawh,” a tih a."
"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:","Bei siemtu chun hrilfiena chu a ṭha ti a hrietin Josef kuomah, “Kei khawm mang ka nei a, bei vâr leikhâwr pathumin ka lo sipsuon a;"
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.,"chun, leikhâwr chunghnung taka chun Pharao bu, beisiemtuin a siem, chi tinrêng hi a lo um a; chuong chu vatehaiin ka leikhawr sîpsuona inthawk chun an lo fâk mur mur a,” a tih a."
"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;","Josef chun a dawn a, “Hi hi a hrilfiena a nih: leikhâwr pathum chu ni thum a nih;"
"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.","tuta inthawka ni thuma chun Pharaoin i tisaa inthawkin i lu chu dawm kâng a ta, thing lêrah khai a ti che; chuongchun, vatehaiin i sa chu an fâk mur mur ding a ni chu,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.","Chun, ni thum ni, Pharao pieng champhaphâk ni chun, Pharaoin ama siehlaw po pohai ta dingin ruoi a ṭheh a; chun, a siehlawhai laia mi uoin pe hotu tak le bei siem hotu tak lu chu a dawm kâng tah a."
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:,"Uoin pe hotu tak chu uoin pe hotuah ân ṭhangtir nâwk a; chuong- chun, no chu Pharao kuta chun a pêk tah a;"
but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.,"bei siem hotu tak ruok chu a khai tah a, Josefin an kuoma a hrilfie ang tak el khan."
"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.","Nisienlakhawm, uoin pe hotu tak chun Josef chu a hriet zing awzâwng ta nawh a, a theinghil tah a."
"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.","Chun, kum hni zet hnungah Pharao chun mang a nei a: Nile vadung panga hin a lo ngir a."
"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.","Bâwngpui pasari naltak tak, thâutak tak tuia inthawka hung suok a, phairuong laia tla hi a hmuh a."
"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.","Chun, bâwngpui dang pasari ber- tak tak, chêrtak tak hi tuia inthawk bawka an hnunga hung suok ve chu a hmuh a, bâwngpui danghai kâwlah vadung panga chun an lo ngîr a."
And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.,"Chun, bâwngpui bertak tak, chêrtak tak chun bâwngpui naltak tak, thâutak tak chu an fâk zo el tah a. Chun, Pharao chu a ṭhang tah a."
"And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.","Chun, a hang in nâwk a, mang a nei nâwk chun, bu kûng khata hin vui sari lientak tak, ṭhatak tak an hung suok a."
"And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.",Chu hnunga chun vui sari chitê te khawsak thliin a mût ṭâwl bir berhai chu an hung suok nâwk a.
"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.","Chun, vui chitê têhai chun vui sari lientak tak, ṭhatak takhai chu an lem zo el tah a. Chun, Pharao chu a ṭhang a, a mang a lo ni zing el ti a hriet a."
"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.","Chun, zîngtieng chun a lungin- zîng ta hle el a; chuongchun, mi a tir a, Aigupta rama mitvaidawithiem po po le mivar po po chu a ko a; Pharao chun a mang chu a lo hril tâwl a: nisienlakhawm, Pharao hrilfie thei tukhawm an um nawh a."
"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:","Chun, uoin pe hotu tak chun Pharao kuomah, “Vawisûn hin ka suksuolzie ka hriet suok tah:"
"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:","Pharao a siehlawhai chungah a lunginsen a, vêngtu pâwl hotu ina chun kei le bei siem hotu tak chu a mîn tângtir a;"
"and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.","Chun, kei le ama chun zân khatah mang kan nei a, mang umze tum ve ve a nih kan nei chu."
"And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.","Chutaka chun kan kuoma vêngtu pâwl hotu siehlaw, Hebrai mi, tlangvâl pakhat a um a: ama chu kan hril a, ama chun kan manghai chu a mi hrilfie tah a, kan mang ang dungzui pei chun a mi hrilfiepêk ve veh a."
"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.","Chun, a mi hrilfie ang tak chun a hung um ta ngei a nih: kei chu ka sinthaw hi a mîn thawtir nâwk a, ama chu a khaihlum tah a,” a tih a."
"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.","Chuongchun, Pharao chun Josef chu ân kotir nghâl tah a, inhmawtakin ripa inthawk chun an ṭhuoi suok tah a; chun, ama chu ânvaw fai a, a silfên chu a thleng a, Pharao kuomah a hung lût a."
"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.","Chun, Pharao chun Josef kuomah, “Mang ka nei a, a hrilfie thei tukhawm an um nawh a, nangin mang hi a thu i hriet chun i hrilfie thei ti i chanchin mi hril ka lo hriet a,” a tih a."
"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.","Josef chun Pharao chu a dawn a, “Chu chu keimaa um a ni nawh a, Pathienin Pharao chu thlamuong- thlâktakin dawn lem a tih,” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:","Chun, Pharaoin Josef kuomah, “Ngai ta, ka manga chun Nile vapanga hin ka lo ngîr a,"
"and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:","bâwngpui pasari naltak tak, thâutak tak hi tuia inthawk chun an hung suok a, phairuong lai hin an lo tlah a:"
"and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:","chun, bâwngpui dang pasari bertak tak, chêrtak tak le inthirtak tak, chuong ang hrima sie Aigupta ram po poa khawm ka la hmu ngai naw hi, an hnungah an hung suok veh a;"
and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:,"chun, bâwngpui bertak tak, chêrtak takhai chun bâwngpui pasari thâutak tak hung suok hmasahai chu an fâk zo el tah a."
"and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.","Amiruokchu, an fâk zo hnung khawm chun tu khawma an fâk ti an hriet chuong nawh, a phuta ang bawk khan an la ber zing a. Chun, ka ṭhang tah a."
"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:","Chun, ka manga chun bu kûng khata vui sari lientak tak, ṭhatak tak hung suok ka hmu bawk a;"
"and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:","chu hnunga chun vui sari vuoi sil sel, chite te, khawsak thli imût ṭâwl bir ber hi an hung suok nâwk a:"
and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.,"chun, vui chite tehai chun vui sari ṭhatak takhai chu an lem zo el tah a. Chun, mitvaidawithiemhai chu ka hril a, nisienlakhawm, a mi hrilfie thei tukhawm an um si nawh a,” tiin a hril a."
"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.","Chun, Josef chun Pharao kuom- ah, “Pharao mang hi thuhmun a nih: Pathienin a thilthaw ding Pharao ân hriettir a ni chu."
The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.,"Bâwngpui pasari ṭhatak takhai chu kum sari an nih, bu vui sari ṭhatak takhai khawm chu kum sari an ni bawk a; mang chu thuhmun a nih."
"And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.","An hnunga bâwngpui pasari bertak tak, chêrtak tak hung suokhai chu kum sari an nih; bu vui sari a si ruok khawsak thli imût ṭâwl bir berhai khawm chu: chuong chu ṭâm kum, kum sari ding a nih."
That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.,Chu chu a nih Pharao kuoma ka hril kha: Pathienin a thilthaw ding Pharao ân hriettir a ni hi.
"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:",Aigupta ram sûng po poa hin hausakna nasatak kum sari a hung tlung ding a nih;
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;,"chu hnunga chun ṭâm kum, kum sari hung um nâwk a tih, chuongchun, hausakna po po kha Aigupta rama hin theinghil vawng ni tâng a tih; ṭâm chun ram hi fa se zo a tih:"
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.,"hausakna kha a zuitu ṭâm lei chun hi rama hin hre ta naw ni hai, a nasa hle ding a ni sih a."
"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.","Chun, Pharao mang ân nei nawntirna che chu hi lei hi a nih, thil thaw ding chu Pathienin a sukdet a, Pathien bawkin ân tlungtir vak ding leiin."
"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.","Chuleiin, tuhin Pharao chun mi pakhat vartak, bengvârtak zawng suok sienla, Aigupta ram chunga hin hotuah inumtir raw se."
"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.","Pharaoin chu chu thaw sienla; chun, ram chunga hin hotuhai ruot sienla, hausak kum, kum sari sûng chun Aigupta ram bu hi hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat pei la khâwm raw hai se."
"And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.","Anni chun chuong kum ṭhat kum hung tlung dinga bu po po chu Pharao thuneinain la khâwmin, fâk dingin khuoahai sung khâwmin vawng ṭha raw hai se."
"And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.","Chuongchun, ṭâm leia ram hi a bohmang nawna dingin, bu chu ṭâm kum, kum sari, Aigupta rama hung tlung ding sûnga ding chun, hi ram ta ding hin inringlâwkna ding nîng a tih,” a tih a."
"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.",Chu thu chu Pharao le a sie- hlawhai po po chun ṭha an ti zâwng tak a nih a.
"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?","Chun, Pharao chun a siehlaw- hai kuomah, “Hieng ang, Pathien thlarau umna mi hi, ei hmu zo ding am a nih?” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:","Pharao bawk chun Josef kuom- ah, “Pathienin chuong po po chu ân hriettir che leiin, nang anga bengvâr le var hrim hi an um nawh:"
"thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.","nang hi ka sûnghai chunga hotuah um i ta, ka khuoletui po po i thu thuin um a tih: lalṭhungphaa ṭhung thua chau hin nanga nêkin inlal ka tih,” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.","Pharao bawk chun Josef kuomah, “En ta, Aigupta ram sûng po poa hin hotuah ka siem che,” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;","Chun, Pharaoin a kuta inthawkin a hming namna kutsebi chu a phawi a, Josef kutah ân buntir a, puon zai inhmia siem silfênhai ân hâktir bawk a, a rîngah rângkachak khaidiet ân hlîtir a;"
"and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.","Chun, a tawlailîr nei pahninaa chun ân chuongtir a, a hmaa chun, “Dingṭhaṭhuon ro,” tiin an khêk pei a; chuongchun, Aigupta ram po po chunga chun hotuah a siem tah a."
"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.","Chun, Pharaoin Josef kuomah, “Kei Pharao ka nih, nanga thu naw chun Aigupta ram sûng po poa hin tukhawmin an kut amanih, an ke amanih inlet naw ni hai,” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.","Chun, Pharaoin Josef hmingah Zaphenath-paneah ân bûk a: On khaw thiempu Potiphera naunu Asenath chu nuhmeiah ân neitir bawk a. Chun, Josef chu a suok a, Aigupta ram chu a fang tah a."
"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.","Josef chu Aigupta lal Pharao hmaa a ngîr laiin kum sâwmthum mi a nih. Chun, Josef chu Pharao kuoma inthawk chu a suok a, Aigupta ram po po chu a fang suok tah a."
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.,"Chun, kum ṭhat kum, kum sari sûng chun hnuoi chun hlâwktakin bu an suo hlak a."
"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.","Aigupta rama kum ṭhat kum, kum sari hung tlunga bu po po chu a lâk khâwm a, bu chu khuohaia chun a sung khâwm tah a; khaw tinah a vêl lova bu seng chu a sung khâwm pei a."
"And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.","Chuongchun, Josef chun bu chu tamtak, tuisuorieta phaiphin zâtin a sung khâwm rei rui el a, ân khi khawm chu a ma ta hiel a, inkhi sêng ruol a ni ta si nawh a."
"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.","Ṭâm hung tlung hma chun Josef chun naupasal pahni a nei a, chuhai chu On khaw thiempu Potiphera naunu Asenath chun a neipêk a nih."
"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.","Josef chun a nau lutîr hminga chun Manasse a sak a, “Pathienin kân rimna po po le ka pa sûnghai chu a mîn theinghiltir ta sih a,” a tih a."
And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.,"Chun, a nau pahnina hminga chun Ephraim a sak a, “Pathienin ka rinum tuorna rama hin chi a mîn thlatir ta sih a,” a tih a."
"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.","Kum ṭhat kum, kum sari, Aigupta rama hung tlung chu a hung bo tah a."
"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.","Chun, ṭâm kum, kum sari chu Josef hril ang takin a hung tlung phut ve tah a: ram tinah ṭâm a hung tla tah a, Aigupta ram sûng poa ruok chun fâk ding a um a."
"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.","Aigupta rama mi po po chu an ṭâm phingleh Pharao kuomah fâk ding hniin an khêk a.

"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.","Ṭâm chu ram po poa a hung tla phing chun Josef chun an sung khâwmna in po po chu a hawng a, Aigupta mihai kuoma chun a zawr a: Aigupta rama chun ṭâm chu a tla nasa hleh a."

"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.","Ama bawk chun, “Ngai ta u, Aigupta ramah bu a um ti ka lo hriet tah: thi loa ei hring suok theina dingin chutaka chun zu fe unla, chutaka inthawk chun zûn chaw ro khai,” a tih a."
And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.,"Chuongchun, Josef uhai sâwm chu Aiguptaah bu inchaw dingin an zu fe tah a."
"But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure harm befall him.","Josef sang Benjamin ruok chu a uhai lai Jakob chun ân fetir ve nawh a, “Tuok suol zu tuok hlau rawi a tih,” a ti a nih."

"And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.","Chun, Josef chu Aigupta ram chunga chun hotu a nih a, ama chu chu rama mi po po kuoma a zawrtu a nih: chuongchun, Josef unauhai chu an hung a, hnuoi sikin ama chibai an bûk tâwl a."
"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye?

"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.","Josef chun a uhai rawi chu a lo hriet a, anni ruok chun ama chu an hriet si nawh a."
"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.","Chun, Josef chun anni chung- châng thu manga a hmuhai kha a hung hriet suok tah a, an kuomah, “Enthlatuhai in ni hi, ram ruokzie en dinga hung in ni hi tie,” a tih a."

"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka awi nawh, ram ruokzie en dinga hung in ni hi maw,” a tih a."
"And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.","Anni chun, “Keini i siehlawhai hi unau sâwmpahni, Kanaan rama um, mi pakhat nau kan nih: chun, ngai ta, kan mi tlum tak tuhin kan pa kuomah a um a, pakhat ruok chu a um ta naw a nih,” an tih a."
"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:","Josef chun an kuomah, “ ‘Enthlatuhai in ni hi,’ ka ti kha in ni ngei hi."

And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.,An kâra ṭawng inlettu a um leiin Josef chun an thu hril chu a hriet ti an hriet nawh a.
"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.","Chun, ama chu ân her hmang a, a ṭap tah a: chun, an kuomah a kîr nâwk a, anni a biek a, anni laia Simeon chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a; an mithmua chun a khuop tah a."

"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.","Anni laia mi pakhatin riebûka chun a sabengtung bu pe dinga a ip a hang hawng chun, a tangka chu a hmu ta el a, a ip bau bula chun a lo um a."
"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?","Chuongchun, a unauhai kuoma chun, “Ka tangka kha an lo sie nâwk a ni hi tie, en ta u, ka ipa hi a lo um zing el,” a tih a: chun an lung a kak rak a, “Pathienin hieng anga a mi thaw hi iengtizie am a ni aw?” tiin, inthin pumin an inen tâwl a."
"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,","Kanaan rama an pa kuom chu an hung tlung a, an chunga thil hung tlung po po chu an hril a."
"The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.","“Chu an ram hotu chun inrawm- takin a mi biek a, ram enthlatuah a mi ruot a."

And the famine was sore in the land.,"Chun, chu rama chun ṭâm chu a tla nasa hleh a."
"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.","Aiguptaah bu an phur kha an fâk zo chun, an pa chun an kuomah, “Fe nâwk unla, bu tlâwmte bêk ei ta dingin zûn chaw nâwk ro khai,” a tih a."

and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:,"Tangka khawm a lêt hniin chawi unla, in ip bau bula tangka a pêkkîr hai cheu khawm kha chawi kîr nâwk ro; a thaw pal a ni rawi mawh."

And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.,Mi chun Josef thupêk ang chun a thawh a; anni chu Josef ina chun a ṭhuoi lût a.
"And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.","Chun, Josef ina ṭhuoi lûta an um leiin an ṭih a, “Fe hmasak ṭuma ei ipa tangka a mi pêk kîrhai lei khan a ni hi a mi ṭhuoi lût: ei chunga remchâng zawnga mi thawin, eini le ei sabengtunghai le hin suoka um dinga mi man a tum a ni hi,” an tih a."

"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.","Chun, ama chun, “Chuong ang chun ka thaw naw dingzie chu: a kuta no an hmuna bak hi ka suokah um a tih: nangni ruok chu in pa kuomah lungmuongtakin fe ta ro,” a tih a."
"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.","Chu phingleh Juda chun Josef chu a va hnai a, “Aw pu, lungin- siettakin i siehlaw hi i hrietah thu bau khat mîn hriltir rawh, i lunginsen chu i siehlaw chunga hin inchawktir naw la, nang chu Pharao ang el i ni sih a."
"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?","Pu, nangin, ‘Pa amanih, unau amanih in nei am?’ tiin i siehlawhai hi i mîn dawn a."
"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.","Chun, pu, keinîn i kuoma hin, ‘Pa, tarsie le, a tar tieng nau, naupangtak kan nei, chu u chu a thih a, a pa chun ama chu a hmangai ngawt el,’ kan tih a."

"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.","Chun, nangin i siehlawhai kuoma hin, ‘In mi tlumtak chu nangni le a hung thla ve naw chun ka hmêl hmu ta naw ti niu,’ i tih a."
"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.","I siehlaw kan pa kuom kan hang tlung chun, pu, i thu chu kan hril a."
"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.","Chun, kan pa chun, ‘Fe nâwk phawt unla, bu tlâwmte bêk ei ta dingin zûn chaw nâwk ro,’ a tih a."
"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.","Chun, keinîn, ‘Zu fe thei ta naw ning ungah: kan mi tlumtak hi kan kuoma a hung ve ding chun zu fe nâwk el kan tih, kan mitlum tak hi kan kuoma a hung ve naw ding chun, ama hmêl chu kan hmu thei naw ding a nih,’ kan tih a."
"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:","Chun, i siehlaw ka pa chun kan kuomah, ‘Ka nuhmei chun naupasal pahni a mi neipêk ti in hriet;"
"and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:","Chun, pakhat chu ka kuoma inthawkin a fe suok a; keinawi nengin a um ni ngei a tih ka tih a; chutaka inthawk chu ama chu ka hmu ta naw vang vang a."
"and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.","Ama khawm hi ka kuoma inthawk in ṭhuoi hmang a, tuoksuol a zu tuok chun, ka lu inṭuok hi lungngaitakin thlânah in mîn liemtir ding a nih,’ a tih a."
"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;","Chuongchun, Bawipu hi kan laia ṭhang loa, i siehlaw ka pa kuom ka hang tlung chun, a hringna chu Bawipu hringna le hin ân zawm tlat leiin hieng ang hi nîng a tih:"

"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.","I siehlaw hin, ‘I kuoma ka hung ṭhuoi nâwk naw chun a maw chu kumkhuoin i chungah phur ka tih,’ tiin ka pa kuoma chun Bawipu chungthua hin a bul tumtuah kân siem ta sih a."
"Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.","Chuleiin, lunginsiettakin, i sie- hlaw hi Bawipu aiah, pu, i suokah mîn umtir la, Bawipu hi a uhai kuomah hang infetir rawh."
"For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.","Bawipu ṭhang loin ka pa kuomah iengtin am hang fe thei ka ti leh? ka pa chunga sietna tlung ding chu hmu ngam naw ning,” a tih a."
"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.","Chun, Josef chu a kâwla ngîr po pohai hmaa chun ân sûm zo ta nawh a, “Mi po po ka kuoma inthawk hin infe suoktir vawng ro,” tiin a khêk a."

"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.","Chun, Josef chun a unauhai kuom- ah, “Josef kha ka nih, ka pa chu a la dam maw?” a tih a.

"And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.","Tuhin hitaka fe dinga in mi zawr leiin lungngai naw ro, nangni le nangni intheida bawk naw ro: mihai hringna sanhim dingin Pathienin in hmaah a mi tir hmasa a ni hi."
"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.","Hi kum hni sûng hi hi rama hin ṭâm a hung tla tah a: kum nga a la bâk a, chu sûng po chu hnuoi inlet um naw nih a, bu sîk khawm um naw bawk a tih."

"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.","Chuongchun, hitaka mîn kaitirtu hi nangni in ni nawh a, Pathien a ni lem, ama chun Pharao paa le a sûnghai po po hotuah le Aigupta ram po po rorêltuah a mi siem tah a."
"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;","Inhmâwtakin ka pa kuomah hang fe unla, a kuomaah, ‘I naupa Josef chun hieng ang hin a tih, Pathienin Aigupta ram po po hotuah a mi siem tah a, ka kuomah hung thla rawh, sâwt hung riel naw rawh;"

"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.","Chun, a ir le a sang Benjamin ir chu suktuoin a ṭap bawk a."

"And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.","Chun, “Josef unauhai an hung,” ti thuthang Pharao ina an lo hriet chun Pharao le a siehlawhai a suklâwm hleh a."
"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;","Pharao chun Josef kuomah, “I unauhai kuomah, ‘Hieng hin thaw ro, in sahai bu inphurtir unla, Kanaan ramah fe ro:"

"Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.","Chun, hieng ang hin hril bawk la: in nauhai ta ding le in nuhmeihai ta dingin Aigupta rama inthawk hin tawlailîrhai lain fe unla, in pa ṭhuoiin hung ro."

"And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.","Chuongchun, Israel nauhai chun chuong ang chun an thawh a: chun, Josef chun Pharao thupêk ang chun tawlailîrhai a pêk a, lampuia dingin fâk ding a pêk bawk a."
"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.",An rênga kuomah silfên in- thlengna ding a pêk seng a; Benjamin kuoma lem chu tangka za thum le silfên inthlengna panga a pêk a.
"And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.","Chun, an pa kuoma chun sabengtung sâwm Aigupta rama thil ṭha phur le, sabengtungpui sâwm, bu le bei le, lampuia a pa ta dinga mamaw danghai phur ân phur a."

"And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.","A kuomah, “Josef kha a la dam a, Aigupta ram po po rorêltu a nih,” tiin an hril a. Chun, a lung chu a chau sul a, an thu hril chu a awi si nawh a."
"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:","Chun, a kuomah Josef thu hril po po chu an hril a; a chuongna ding tawlailîrhai Josefin a inphur chu a hmu chun an pa Jakob lungril chu a har ta huoi a:"

"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.","Chun, Aigupta ram le Kanaan rama tangka po po an hmang zo hnung chun Aigupta mi po po chu Josef kuoma chun an hung a, “Fâk ding mi pe raw khai, i hmaa hin kan thi el ding am a nih? tangka hlak a um ta si nawh a,” an tih a."
"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.","Chun, Josef chun, “In ranhai hung pe el ro, in ranhai manah fâk ding pêng ka ti cheu,” a tih a."
"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.","Chuongchun, an ranhai chu Josef kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; Josef chun chuong sakawrhai, berâm ruolhai, bâwng ruolhai le sabeng- tunghai mana chun fâk ding a pêk pei a: chu kum chun an ran po po manah fâk ding a pêk a, a châwm tâwl tah a."
"And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:","Chu kum chu ân vawi a, kum a hung thar chun an hung nâwk a, a kuomah, “Pu, kan tangka po po kan hmang zo tâkzie le, kan ran ruolhai i ta a ni tâkzie hi, pu, i kuoma hin ip naw ning ungah: pu, i mithmua hin kan ramhai le kan tisa bak naw chu iengkhawm a um ta dêr nawh a;"
"wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.","i hmaa hin keini le kan ram hi kan bohmang el ding am a nih?

"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh’s.","Chuongchun, Josef chun Pharao ta dingin Aigupta ram po po chu ân châwkpêk tah a; ṭâm chu an chunga a tlung nasa bêk leiin Aigupta mihai chun an lo chu an zawr sih a.

"And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh’s.","Chuongchun, Josef chun Pha- raoin hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat a hmu pei ding thu hi, Aigupta ram ta dingin tu chen hin dânah a siem tah a: thiempuhai ram bak chu a nih Pharao ta ni lo chu."
"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.","Chuongchun, Israelhai chun Aigupta rama Gosen rama chun umhmun an khuor tah a; chutaka chun an insukmuk a, chi tamtak an thlah a, nasatakin an pung tah a."

"And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;","Chun, Israel thi hun ding chu a hung hnai tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Josef chu a ko a, a kuomah, “I mi lunginsiet thei chun, lungin- siettakin i kut kha ka êlpui hnuoiah rawl la, ka chungah thuzâwmtak le indiktaka thaw dingin intiem rawh.

"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).","Chun, keia thu chu, Paddan- aram rama inthawka ka hung lai khan Rakil chu Kanaan ramah, lam- pui kârlakah, Ephrath chu a la hlat fe laiin, ka bulah a thih a: chutaka Ephrath lampuia chun ka phûm tah a (chu chu Bethlehem a nih)” a tih a."

"and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:","Methusela a nei hnung chun Enok chu kum za thum sûng Pathien leh an lêng hmunkhat hlak a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a;"
and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:,"chuongchun, Enok dam sûng po chu kum za thum le sâwmruk le panga a nih;"
and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.,"Chun, Enok chu Pathien leh an lêng hmunkhat hlak a: chun, a um ta nawh a: Pathienin a lâk hmang tah a nih."
"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:",Methusela chun kum za le sâwmriet le pasari a niin naupasal Lamek a nei a;
"and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:","Lamek a nei hnung chun Methusela chu kum za sari le sâwmriet le pahni a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a;"
and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.,"chuongchun, Methusela dam sûng po chu kum za kuo le sâwmruk le pakuo a nih; chun, a thi tah a."
"And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:","Chun, Lamek chu kum za le sâwmriet le pahni a niin naupasal a nei a;"
"and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which cometh because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.","“Ama ngei hin LALPA ṭawngse inphur hnuoi leia ei sinthawna le kuta ei sininrimnaa hin mi thlamuon tâng a tih,” tiin a hmingah Noa a sak a."
"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:","Chun, Noa a nei hnung chun Lamek chu kum za nga le sâwmkuo le panga a la dam a; naunuhmei le naupasalhai a la nei nâwk a;"
And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.,"chun, Lamek dam sûng po chu kum za sari le sâwmsari pasari a nih; chun, a thi tah a."
"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.","Chun, Noa chu kum za nga mi a na; Noa chun naupasal Sem, Ham, le Japheth a nei a."
"And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.","Chun, Josef chun a pa hmai a sik a, a ṭah a, a fâwp a fâwp a."
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.,"Chun, Josefin a siehlaw damdawi thiemhai chu a pa ruong chu hmawn thei loa siem dingin thu a pêk a: chuongchun, damdawi thiemhai chun Israel ruong chu hmawn thei loin an siem tah a."
And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.,"A ruong siemna dingin ni sâwmli an awh a, hmawn thei loa siemna chun ni chuong zât chu a aw hlak hrim a nih; chun, ni sâwmsari sûng Aigupta mihai chun ama an ṭah a."
"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,","Chun, ama an ṭa a bo hnung chun Josefin Pharao sûnghai chu a biek a, “In mi lunginsiet thei chun, lungin- siettakin Pharao hrieta chun,"
"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.","‘Ka pain, ngai ta, ka thi ding a ni tah, Kanaan rama ka thlân ka chosaah, chutaka ngei chun mi hung phûm rawh,’ tiin a mîn khâmtir a. Chuleiin, tuhin lunginsiettakin, ka pa hi mi hang inphûmtir rawh; chun, hung nâwk el ka tih, a tih a, tiin hril ro,” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.","Chun, Pharao chun, “Ân khâmtir ang che chun i pa chu hang phûm raw chu,” a tih a."
"And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,","Chuongchun, Josef chu a pa phûm dingin a hang fe tah a. Pharao siehlaw po po, a sûnghai laia upahai leh, Aigupta ram upahai po po le,"
"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.","Josef sûnghai po po leh, a unauhai leh, a pa sunghai chu ama leh an fe veh a. An nauhai rawi le, an berâm ruolhai le, an bâwng ruolhai bak chu Gosen rama chun an mâk- san a."
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.,"Anni ruol chun tawlailîrhai le, sakawr chung chuong mihai an hang fe veh a; pâwl ruol lientak an nih."
"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.","Chun, Jordan râla Atad hrizâwl chu an tlung a, chutaka chun nasatakin an ṭah a, ni sari a pa sûnna a siem a."
"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.","Chu rama mi Kanaan mihai chun Atad hrizâwla an mithi sûn chu an hmu chun, “Hi Aigupta mihai mithi sûnna nasatak a ni hi,” an tih a; chuleiin, chu hmun hminga chun Abel-mizraim an inbûk tah a, chu chu Jordan râla um a nih."
And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:,"Chun, a naupasalhai chun a thupêk ang peiin an thawpêk a,"
"for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.","a naupasalhai chun Kanaan ramah an zâwn lût a, Abrahamin inphûmna hmun ro dinga, Hit mi Ephrona inthawka a lo puma a închâwk, Mamre zâwna Makpela loa pûka khan an phûm tah a."
"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.","Josef chu a pa phûm zo chun ama le a unauhai le, a pa phûm dinga ama ruola hang fehai po po le chun Aiguptaah an kîr nâwk tah a."
"And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.","Josef unauhai chun an pa thi chu an ngaituoin, “Josef hin mi theidâng a ta, a chunga thil ei suksuol po po phuba kha ei chunga hin la hung la kim nek el a ti aw,” an tih a."
"And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,","Chuongchun, Josef kuoma hril dingin thu an inchah a, “I pa chun a thi hma khan,"
"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.","‘Hieng ang hin Josef kuomah, Lunginsiettakin i unauhai bawsietna le an suolna chu ngaidam rawh, i chungah thil chu an suksuol deha chu, tiin hril ro,’ tiin thu a mi pêk a: tuhin, lunginsiettakin i pa Pathien siehlawhai bawsietnahai chu ngai- dam rawh,” an tih a. Chuonga a kuoma an hang hril chun Josef chu a ṭap tah a."
"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.","A unauhai khawm chu an va feh a, a hmaa chun an bawkkhup tâwl a, “Ngai ta, i siehlawhai kan ni hi,” an tih a."
"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?","Josef chun an kuomah, “Ṭi naw ro, Pathien aiaw am ka nih?"
"And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.","Nangni chun ka chungah thil suol thaw in lungril a; nisienla- khawm, Pathien chun, vawisûna an um ang ngei hin, mi tamtak dama sanhimna dingin thil ṭhaha in- changtir a lo lungril lem a ni sih a."
"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.","Chuleiin, ṭi naw ro, nangni le in nau-le-tehai chu châwm pei ka tih,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a thlamuon a, bau ṭhatakin a biek tâwl a."
"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.","Chun, Josef chu ama le a pa sûnghai leh Aigupta rama chun a um a: Josef chu kum za le sâwm a dam a."
And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.,"Josef chun Ephraim nau a tuhai khûp thum chen a hmuh a, Manasse naupa Makir nauhai khawm Josef mal chungah an pieng a."
"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.","Chun, Josefin a unauhai kuom- ah, “Ka thi ding a ni tah a, ni- sienlakhawm, Pathienin hung kan ngei ngei a ti cheu a, hi rama inthawk hi hung ṭhuoi suok cheuvin, Abraham, Isak le Jakob hai kuoma inkhâma pêk a tiem ramah ṭhuoi a ti cheu,” a tih a."
"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.","Chun, Josef chun Israel thlahai chu ân khâmtir a, “Pathienin hung kan ngei ngei a ti cheu a, ka ruhai hi hitaka inthawkin khitieng in zâwn ngei ding a nih,” a tih a."
"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.","Chuongchun, Josef chu kum za le sâwm mi a niin a thih a; a ruong chu hmawntheiloin an siem a, Aiguptaah kuongin an sie tah a."
"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,","Chun, hieng hi a na, hnuoi chungah mihriem an hung pung a, naunuhmeihai an hung nei tâwl chun,"
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.,"Pathien naupasalhai chun mi- hriem naunuhmeihai chu hmêl ṭhatakin an hmuh a; chuongchun, an dit zâwng taphawthai chu nuhmeiah an nei tâwl hlak a."
"And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.","Chun, LALPA chun, “Ka thlarau chu mihriemah chêng kumkhuo naw ni; chun mihriem chu kumkhuoin thaw rawp naw nih; ama chu tisa a ni sih a; chuongchun, a dam sûng hun khawm kum za le sâwmhni ni raw se,” a tih a."
"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.","Chuong lai chun Milienhai chu hnuoia hin an um a; chu hnunga khawm Pathien naupasalhai chun mihriem naunuhmeihai chu an pâwl a, anni leh nauhai an nei hlak lai khan, an um bawk a; chuonghai chu tienlaia mi hrât, mi hming inthanghai kha an nih."
"And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.","Chun, LALPA chun hnuoia hin mihriem suolzie chu nasatak a nih ti le, a lungril ngaituonahai hrim hrim chu suol ruok a nih ti a lo hriet a."
"And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.","Chuongchun, hnuoia hin mi- hriem a lo siem ta lei chun LALPA chu ân sîr a, lungril natnain a hmang pha tah a."
"And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun, “Ka mihriem siem hi hnuoi chunga inthawk hin sukbohmang el ka tih a, mihriem dâm, sa dâm, thilhring dâm, chunglêng vate dâm chen hin; ka siem ta leiin kân sîr a nih,” a ta."
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.,Noa ruok chun LALPA lungin- sietna a chang a.
"These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.","Hienghai hi Noa thlahai chu an nih: Noa chu mi feltak a na, a dam ruolpuihai lai chun sawisêlbo a nih: Noa chu Pathien leh an lêng hmunkhat hlak."
"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.","Noa chun naupasal pathum, Sem, Ham le Japheth a nei a."
"And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.","Chun, hnuoi hi Pathien mit- hmuin a se zo tah a, hnuoi hi inpâwngnêknain a sip zo ta bawk a."
"And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.","Chun, Pathienin hnuoi hi a en a; chun, ngai ta, a se zo tah: tisa po poin hnuoia hin an umdân an suksiet zo ta sih a."
"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.","Chun, Pathienin Noa kuoma chun, “Tisa po po suktâwpna ding thu ka sukthlûk tah: anni leiin hnuoi hi inpâwngnêknain a sip zo ta sih a: chuongchun, ngai ta, a hnuoi pumin ka sukbohmang ding a nih."
"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.","I ta dingin fâr thingin lawng siem rawh: lawnga chun pindan- hai siem i ta, a puo tieng le a sûng tieng chu fâr hnai nâl vawng bawk i tih."
"And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.","Hi hi i siem dân ding chu a nih: lawng dung tieng chu tawng za thum ni sienla, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmnga, ân sâng tieng chu tawng sâwmthum ni raw se."
"A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.","Lawnga chun tukver siem i ta, a chung tieng tawng khat chinah i zo ding a nih; chun, lawng kawtkhâr chu a pangah i hawng ding a nih; sâwng hnuoihnung le sâwng hnina le sâwng thumna neiin i siem ding a nih."
"And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.","Chun, ngai ta, keima ngeiin, tisa po po hringna thuoka inthuok taphawt chu vân hnuoia inthawka sukbohmang dingin hnuoia hin tui ka suklêt ding a nih; hnuoia thil tinrêng um hi thi vawng an tih."
"But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.","Amiruokchu, ka thuthlung chu i kuomah sukdet lem ka tih, lawnga chun i lût ding a nih, nang lût i ta, i naupasalhai leh, i nuhmei leh, i nauhai nuhmeihai khawm i kuomah an lût ve ding a nih."
"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.","Chun, tisa po poa thilhring tinrêng laia mi, chi tin pahni peiin i kuoma a hringa um ve dingin lawnga chun i ṭhuoi lût ding a nih, a pui le a chal an ni seng ding a nih."
"Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.","Vatehai anni chi umdân ang sengin, ranhai anni chi umdân ang sengin, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâk chi tinrêng anni chi umdân ang sengin, chi tin pahni pei a hringa um dingin, i kuomah an hung ve ding a nih."
"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.","Chun, bu fâk hlak ang chi po po la la, i kuomah sie khâwm rawh; chuongchun, nangni le anni ta dingin bu nîng a tih,” a ta."
"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.","Chuong ang chun Noa chun a thawh a, Pathienin a kuoma thu a pêk po po ang ngei chun a thaw tah a."
"And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.","Chun, LALPAIN Noa kuoma chun, “Nang le i sûnghai po po chu lawngah lût ro; nang chu tulai ṭhangthar lai hin ka mithmuin mi feltak i nih ti ka hriet che a nih."
"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:","Sa thieng tinrêng laia mi, a chal le a kawppui a pui seng leh, tuok sari peiin i kuomah ṭhuoi i ta, sa thieng- naw laia mi, a chal le a kawppui, a pui seng leh tuok khat peiin."
"of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.","Chunglêng vate laia mi khawm, a pui le a chal seng, tuok sari peiin, hnuoi chung po poa chi thla dinga hring dingin i ṭhuoi ding a nih."
"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.","Ni sari a la bâk a, chu hnunga chun hnuoi chunga hin ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli sûng ruo insûrtir ka ta; ka thilhring siem tinrêng hi hnuoi chunga inthawkin sukbohmang ka tih,” a ta."
And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.,"Chuongchun, Noa chun LALPAIN a kuoma thu a pêk ang pei chun a thaw tah a."
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.,"Chun, hnuoia tui a hung lêt lai chun Noa chu kum za ruk mi a nih."
"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.","Chun, tui a hung lêt ding a ni lei chun Noa chu lawnga chun a lût a, a naupasalhai le a nuhmei le a nauhai nuhmeihai khawm an lût ve a."
"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,","Sa thieng laia mi le, sa thiengnaw laia mi le, vate laia mi le, hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn tinrêng laia mi khawm,"
"there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.","a pui le a chal a tuok peiin Pathienin Noa kuoma thu a pêk ang khan, Noa kuomah lawngah an lût tah a."
"And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.","Chun, ni sari hnunga chun hnuoia hin tui chu a hung lêt tah a."
"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.","Noa chu kum za ruk a ni kum, a thla hnina ni sâwm le ni sari niah, chu ni ngei chun tui inthûk lientak hnâr po po chu a hung pût ta vawng a, vân tukverhai khawm a hung inhawng ta bawk a."
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.,"Chun, ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli sûng chu hnuoia hin ruopui nasatak a sûr tah a."
"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;","Chu ni ngei chun Noa le a naupasalhai Sem, Ham, Japheth le Noa nuhmei chu lawnga chun an lût tah a, a naupasalhai nuhmei pa- thum khawm an kuomah an lût veh a;"

"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.","Chuongchun, tisa po po hringna thuok nei taphawt chu a tuok peiin Noa kuomah lawnga chun an lût tah a."
"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.","Chun, a lûthai chu Pathienin a kuoma thu a pêk angin, tisa nei laia mi tinrêng chu a pui le a chal a tuok peiin an lût a; chun, LALPAIN ama chu a khâr khum tah a."
"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.","Chun, tui chu hnuoia hin ni sâwmli sûng po a lêt a, tui chu a hung pung a, lawng chu a hung lên kâng a, hnuoi chunga chun a chîm lâng pei tah a."
"And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.","Tui chu a hung um ta puou a, hnuoi chunga hin a hung pung rak el tah a, lawng chu tui chunga chun ân lâng pei a."
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.,"Chun, hnuoi chunga hin tui chu nasatakin a hung um puou el tah a, vân hnuoia tlâng insânghai po po chu a chîm zo tah a."
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.,"Tawng sâwmpanga zeta in- sângin tui chu a hung um ta puou el a, tlânghai chu a tlum hmang ta dai a."
"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:","Chuongchun, tisa hnuoia chângthei po po, vate dâm, ran dâm, sa dâm, thilhring hnuoi chunga bawk- invâka lâwn tinrêng dâm, mihriem tinrêng leh an thi zo vawng tah a;"
"all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.","an hnâra hringna thlarau thuok umna po po, khawmuola um ta- phawthai chu an thi ta vawng a."
"And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.","Chuongchun, hnuoi chunga thil hringna nei tinrêng, mihriem dâm, ran dâm, thilhring bawkinvâk chi dâm, chunglêng vate dâm, hnuoia inthawka sukbohmangin an um tah a: Noa le a kuoma lawnga umhai chau chu hlain an um tah a."
And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.,"Chun, tui chu ni za le sâwmnga sûng po chu hnuoia hin a um ta puou el a."
"And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;","Chun, Pathienin Noa le lawnga a kuoma thilhring tinrêng le ran um po po chu a hriet zing a; chun Pathienin hnuoi chunga hin thli ân hrângtir a, chuongchun, tui chu a hung kang ṭan tah a,"
"the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;","tui inthûktak hnarhai le vân tukverhai khawm chu a hung inkhâr tah a, vâna inthawka ruo hung sûr chu sukchâtin a um ta bawk a;"
and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.,"chuongchun, tui chu hnuoi chunga inthawk chun a kang ta deu deu a, ni za le sâwmnga chu a bo hnung chun tui chu a tlâwm ta deu a."
"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.","Chuongchun, lawng chu thla sarina, ni sâwm le ni sari nia chun Ararat tlânga chun a lo innghat tah a."
"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.","Chun, tui chu thla sâwmna chenin a tlâwm deu deu pei a; thla sâwmna ni khat nia chun, tlâng sîphai chu a hung inlang tah a."
"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:","Chun, ni sâwmli hnunga chun Noa chun lawng tukver a siem kha a hawng tah a:"
"and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.","chun, vaâk pakhat ân vuong suoktir a; chu chu a suok a, hnuoia inthawka tui chu a kang zo hmakhat chu a vuong vêl a vuong vêl a."
"And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;","Chun, hnuoi chunga tui a tlâwm ta le tlâwm ta naw hrietna dingin vaṭhu ân vuong suoktir nâwk a;"
"but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.","nisienlakhawm, vaṭhu chun fûkna ding hrim hrim a hmu nawh a, a kuomah lawngah a kîr nâwk tah a, tui chu hnuoi chung po poa chun a la um sih a; chuongchun, a kut a hang pur dawk a, a man a, lawng sûngah a kuomah a lâk lût nâwk tah a."
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;,"Chun, ni sari dang a nghâk nâwk a, vaṭhu chu lawnga inthawk ân vuong suoktir nâwk a;"
"and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.","vaṭhu chu zântieng chun a kuomah a hung lût nâwk a; chun, ngai ta, oliv hna suktlawng hlim a hmûra chun a hung put a: chuongchun, Noa chun hnuoiah tui a tlâwm tah ti a hriet a."
"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.","Chun, ni sari dang a nghâk nâwk a, vaṭhu chu ân vuong suoktir nâwk a; a kuomah a hung kîr nâwk ta nawh a."
"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.","Chun, a kum za ruk le a kum khatnaah, a thla khatna ni khat nia chun tui chu hnuoia inthawk chun a kang zo tah a: chuongchun, Noa chun lawng inkhumna chu a hâwk a, a en a; chun, ngai ta, hnuoi chung chu a lo inhil ta huou el a."
"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.",A thla hnina ni sâwmhni le ni sari nia chun hnuoi chu a hung ṭâwl zo tah a.
"And God spake unto Noah, saying,","Chun, Pathienin Noa kuoma chun a hril a,"
"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.","“Lawnga inthawkin suok ro, nang le i nuhmei, i naupasalhai le an nuhmeihai leh."
"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.","Tisa po po laia mi thil hringna nei tinrêng i umpuihai, vate dâm, ran dâm, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn tinrêng dâm le khan i kuomah ṭhuoi suok rawh, hnuoia hin te neiin chi tamtak thlaha an hung pung theina dingin,” tiin."
"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:","Chuongchun, Noa chu a suok a, a naupasalhai le a nuhmei le a nauhai nuhmeihai khawm a kuomah an suok veh a;"
"every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.","sa tinrêng dâm, thilhring tinrêng dâm, vate tinrêng dâm, hnuoi chunga chângthei taphawthai chu anni chi umdân ang sengin lawnga inthawk chun an suok tah a."
"And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.","Chun, Noa chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a; chun, sa thieng tinrêng laia mi le, vate thieng tinrêng laia mi a lâk a, mâichâma chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai ân hlân tah a."
"And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for that the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.","Chun, LALPAIN riminhnik chu a hriet a; chun, LALPA chun a lungrilin, “Hnuoi chu mihriem lei chun ṭawngsie inphur nâwk ta naw ning, mihriem lungril ngaituonahai chu an chîntea inthawkin a suol sih a; tuta ka hrem ang hin thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng chu hrem nâwk ta naw bawk ka tih."
"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.","Hnuoi um sûng po bu tu le bu lâk, khaw dei le khaw lum, nipui le phalbi le, sûn le zân dâm hi bo naw nih,” a ta."
"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.","Chun, Pathienin Noa le a naupasalhai chu mal a sâwm a, an kuomah, “Chi tamtak inthlain hung pung unla, hnuoi hi hluo sip ro."
"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.","Nangni ṭîna le pawisakna hnuoia sa tinrêng le chunglêng vate tinrêngin nei an ta; chuonghai le hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn po po le, tuisuorieta nga po pohai chu, in kuta pêk an ni vawng tah."
Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.,Thilhring chângthei tinrênghai chu in ta dingin fâk ding nîng an ta; thlai hring ka pêk ang cheu khan iengkim ka pêk vawng cheu.
"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.","Amiruokchu, sa a hringna (a thisen) pumin in fâk ding a ni nawh."
"And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man.","Chun, in thisen, in hringna phuba chu la ngei ngei ka tih; sa tinrêng chunga chun lâng ka tih, mihriem kuoma inthawk khawmin, mi tin an unauhaia inthawk chun, mihriem hringna phuba chu la seng ka tih."
"Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.",Tukhawm mihriem thisen in- suotu chu mihriem vêkin ama thisen chu an insuo ve ding a nih: Pathienin ama angpuiin mihriem a siem sih a.
"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.","Chun, nangni chu chi tamtak inthlain hung pung ro; hnuoia hin nau tamtak nei unla, a chunga hin hung pung ro,” a ta."
"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,","Chun, Pathienin Noa le a kuoma um a naupasalhai kuoma chun,"
"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;","“Ngai ta u, keima ngeiin in kuoma le in hnunga in thlahai kuoma khawm ka thuthlung chu ka sukdet a nih;"
"and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.","in kuoma thilhring tinrêng um, in umpui vate dâm, ran dâm, ramsa tinrêng kuoma dâm khawm; lawnga inthawka hung suok po po, hnuoia sa tinrêng kuoma chen khawm."
And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.,"In kuomah ka thuthlung chu ka sukdet a; tisa po po tuilêta sukbo- hmangin um ta naw ni hai a, hnuoi sukse dingin tui lêt nâwk ta naw bawk a tih,” tiin a hril a."
"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:","Chun, Pathien bawkin, “Hi hi kei le nangni le in kuoma thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng umhai kâra, suon tâwp loa um peihai ta dingin, ka thuthlung inchikna chu a nih."
"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.","Sûmah ka sumrisâng kân zâmtir a, chu chu kei le hnuoi inkâra thuthlung inchikna ding nîng a tih."
"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,","Chun, hieng hi nîng a ta, hnuoi chunga sûm kân zâmtirin sumrisâng chu sûma chun inlang a ta,"
"and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.","kei le nangni le tisa po po laia thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng inkâra ka thuthlung hi hre zing ka tih. Chuongchun, tui chu tisa po po sukbohmang dingin hung lêt nâwk ta naw nih."
"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.","Chun, sumrisâng chu sûmah inzâm hlak a ta; chuongchun, Pathien le hnuoi chunga tisa um po po laia thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng inkârah kumkhaw thuthlung um chu ka hriet zing theina dingin en hlak ka tih,” a ta."
"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.","Chun, Pathien bawkin, Noa kuoma chun, “Chu chu kei le hnuoi chunga tisa um po po inkâra thuthlung sukdetna inchikna a nih,” a ti bawk a."
"And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.","Chun, Noa naupasal lawnga inthawka suokhai chu Sem, Ham, le Japheth an nih: Ham chu Kanaan pa a nih."
These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.,Chuonghai pathum chu Noa naupasalhai an na: chuonghaia inthawka suokhai chun hnuoi po po hi an dâp zo tah a nih.
"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:","Noa chu hnuoi inlettu hmasa- tak a nih a, Grêp huon a siem a,"
"and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.","uoin chu a dâwn a, ân rui a: chuongchun, a puon inah puon boin a zâl a."
"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.","Chun, Ham, Kanaan pa chun a pa saruokna chu a hmuh a, tuola a unauhai pahni chu a hril a."
"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.","Chuongchun, Sem le Japheth chun puon an lâk a, liengkoa inzâwnin hnungtâwlin an feh a, an pa saruokna chu an inkhum tah a; an hmai chu khingtieng nghain a um a, an pa saruokna chu an hmu nawh a."
"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.","Noa chu a uoin inrui chu a hung har a, a naupasal naupang takin a chunga a thawzie chu a hung hriet tah a."
"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.","Chuongchun, “Kanaan chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se; A unauhai siehlawhai siehlaw nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.","“LALPA, Sem Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se. Kanaan chu Sem siehlawah um raw se"
"God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.","Pathienin Japheth chu suklien sienla, Sem puon inhaiah um raw se; Kanaan chu a siehlawah um raw se,” a ti bawk a."
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.,"Chun, Noa chu tuilêt hnung chun kum za thum sâwmnga a dam a."
And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.,Noa dam sûng po po chu kum za kuo le sâwmnga a na; chun a thi tah a.
