"And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.","Rorêltuhaiin ro an rêl laiin chu rama chun ṭâm a hung tlah a, chun, Juda ram Bethlehema mi pakhat Moab rama um dingin, ama le a nuhmei le a naupasalhai pahni chu an feh a."
"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.","Chu mipa hming chu Elimelek a nih, a nuhmei hming chu Naomi, a naupasalhai pahni hming chu Mahlon le Kilion an nih; Juda ram, Bethlehema Ephrath mi an nih. Moab rama chun an feh a, chutaka chun an um ta zing a."
"And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.","Nisienlakhawm, Elimelek, Nao- mi pasal chu, a thih a, amanu le a naupasalhai pahni chau chu an um tah a."
"And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.","Chuhai chun Moab nuhmeihai nuhmeiah an nei a, pakhat hming chu Orpah a nih a, pakhat dang hming chu Ruth a nih. Chutaka chun kum sâwm lai an um a."
And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.,"Chun, Mahlon le Kilion chu an thi ve veh a; chuongchun, chu nuhmei chu a naupasalhai pahni le a pasal chun an thi san tah a."
"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.","Chun, Moab rama inthawkin, LALPAIN a mihai chu kanin fâk ding a pêkzie thu a lo hriet leiin, a mohai pahni leh Moab rama inthawk kîr nâwk dingin ân thawk suok a."
"And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.","Chuongchun, a umnaa inthawk chun a mohai pahni le chun a suok a, Juda rama kîr nâwk dingin an fe tah a."
"And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.","Chun, Naomi chun a mohai pahni kuoma chun, “Fe unla, in nuhai in ve veah kîr nâwk el ta ro; mithihai chunga le ka chunga in thaw ang tak hin, LALPAIN in chungah ngilnei- takin thaw ve raw se."
"Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.","Pasal dang ina khawsakna in tuok ve ve theina dingin LALPAIN ngaituopêk raw se cheu,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a fâwp a, râwl insuo meuin an ṭap ta rak el a."
"And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.","Anni chun, “Ni lo e, i chihai kuoma i kîrnaa chun hung zui kan ti che,” an tih a."
"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?","Naomi chun, “Ka naunuhai, kîr nâwk lem ro, iengdingin am mi zui in tih a? In pasal ding naupasalhai ka la vawn zing am a nih?"
"Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;","Kîr nâwk unla, ka naunuhai, fe el lem ro, pasal hang nei dingin ka upa taluo ta sih a. Beiseina ka la nei tiin, vawizân hin pasal nei elin nau- pasalhai nei ding hrim lang khawm,"
"would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me.","an puitling chenin in nghâk el ding am a nih? Chu chu lei chun pasal nei loin in um el ding am a nih? Ni lo e, ka naunuhai, ka chunga LALPA kut hieng anga a hung tla ta hi, nangni ta ding hin ka lung a na bêk bêk a nih,” a tih a."
"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her.","Chuongchun, an râwlhai insuo meuin an ṭap rak rak nâwk a; chun, Orpah chun a tarpinu chu a fâwp a, Ruth ruok chun amanu chu a chel tlat a."
"And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law.","Chun, amanu chun, “En ta, i mo chanpuinu chu a chihai kuoma le a pathien kuoma chun a kîr nâwk tah a, nang khawm i mo chanpuinu zuiin kîr nâwk el rawh aw,” a tih a."
"And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;","Nisienlakhawm, Ruth chun, “Nang kîrsan ding che le zui lo ding chein mîn fui naw rawh; i fena phawtah fêng ka ta, i riekna phawtah riek ka ta, i chihai chu ka chihai nîng an ta, i Pathien chu ka Pathien nîng a ta;"
"where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.","i thinaa chun thîng ka ta, chutaka chun phûmin um ve el ka tih. Nang le kei hi thina chau naw thil dangin a mi ṭhe ding chun LALPAIN a law law mi law el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” a tih a."
"And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.",Naomi chun ama zui a tum tlat a nih ti a hrietin a tosan tah a.
"So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the women said, Is this Naomi?","Chuongchun, an pahni chun Bethlehem chenin an fe tah a. Bethlehem an tlung chun anni lei chun a khaw phêkin an inhnîng ta sup sup el a; chun, nuhmeihai chun, “Hi hi Naomi kha a ni maw?” an tih a."
"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Naomi mi ti naw ro, Marah mi ti lem ro, Iengkimthawthei chun lungsiet- thlâktakin a mi thaw ta sih a."
"I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?","Buriptakin ka suok a, LALPA chun kutbenthekin a mi ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a ni hi: LALPA chun ka chung- ah a lungninawna a suklang a, Iengkimthawthei chun a mi sukrimsi ta hnungin, iengdinga Naomi in mi la ti rawp am a na?” a tih a."
"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.","Chuongchun, Naomi chu a hung kîr a, a monu Moab mi Ruth leh, Moab rama inthawk a hung kîr a nih. Bethlehem chu buṭei sîk hun ṭantirin an hung tlung a nih."
"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.","Naomi chun a pasal laibung, Elimelek pahnama mi neinung- tak laibung a nei a, a hming chu Boaz a nih."
"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.","Chun, Moab mi Ruth chun Naomi kuomah, “Lo tieng va fêng ka ta, a mi lo lunginsiet taphawt hai buhnung va zawng ka tih aw,” a tih a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Fe raw chu, ka naunu,” a tih a."
"And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.","Chuongchun, a fe tah a, busîk- tuhai lâk ṭhel chu a va zawng a: Elimelek pahnam, Boaz lo kherah a va fe fûk hlau el a."
"And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.","Chun, ngai ta, Bethlehema in- thawkin Boaz chu a hung a, busîktuhai kuoma chun, “In kuomah LALPA um raw se,” a tih a. Anni chun, “LALPAIN malsâwm raw se che,” tiin an dawn a."
"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?","Chun, Boaz chun a siehlaw, bu- sîktuhai chunga hotu kuoma chun, “Hi hi tu nunghâk am a ni leh?” a tih a."
"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:","Busîktuhai chunga hotu chun, “Moab nunghâk, Moab rama in- thawka Naomi le hung kîr a nih."
"and she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.","‘Mi lunginsiet la, in bu lâk ṭhel zawng ka tih, busîktuhaiin an buphalhai an inkhâwm zona hnung peiah zawng ka tih,’ a tih a; chuongchun, a hung a, ṭuah sâwt nawte a châwl ti naw chu, zîngkâra inthawkin a la zawng ta zing a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.","Chun, Boaz chun Ruth kuomah, “Ka naunu, lo ngai ta, lo danga chu buhnung zawngin fe naw la, hitaka inthawk hi fe sawn naw rawh, ka siehlaw nunghâkhai kuoma hin um zing rawh."
"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.","An busîk hi en zing la, an hnung hi zui pei rawh, tlangvâlhai chu iengkhawm law lo ding chein thu ka pêk diem tah; chun, i dang a châr po leh tuibêla tlangvâlhai tui chawisa va dâwn hlak la,” a tih a."
"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?","Chun, ama chu a kûn a, hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, a kuomah, “Hnam dang ka ni sih a, hienga i mi lo hriet nuoma i mi lo lunginsiet hi iengtizie am a ni leh?” a tih a."
"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.","Boaz chun a dawn a, “I pasal thiha inthawka i tarpinu chunga i thilthawhai po po miin an mi hril vawng a; chun i pa le nu le i pieng- na ram mâksana mi i la hriet ngailohai kuoma i hung dânhai chen hin."
"Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.","LALPA chun i thilthaw tahai chu thung sienla che, LALPA, Israel- hai Pathien, inhumhimna dinga a thla hnuoi i hung phên chun, i ṭhat man pe ṭeu raw se che,” tiin."
"Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.","Chun, amain, “Pu, nangin i mi thlamuon a, i siehlaw nunghâkhai laia mi ni naw lang khawm, ngil- neitaka i mi biek hi ka ta dingin lunginsiettu ropuitak i nih,” a tih a."
"And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.","Chun, bu fâk hunah Boaz chun a kuomah, “Taka hin hung la, beihai hi hung fa ve la, i bei tlanghai chu uoin thûrah inchie ve rawh,” a tih a. Chuongchun, busîktuhai kâwla chun a ṭhung a; chun, buzeu chu an pêk a, a fâk a, a khawp hnung khawm chun fâk sênglo a la nei ta rawp a."
"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.","Chun, buhnung zawng dinga ân thawk nâwk chun, Boaz chun a tlangvâlhai kuomah, “Buphal laia mi khawm rût sienla, hal naw ro."
"And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.","Chun, a têla mi khawm kei- dawkpêk unla, mâksan pei unla, rût raw se, hal naw ro,” tiin a hril a."
"So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","Chuongchun, loa buhnung chu zântieng chenin a zawng khâwm a, a zawngsa chu a vuok a, buṭei epha khat zet a nih."
"And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.","Chun, a phur a, khuo tieng a fe tah a; chun, a bu zawng khâwm chu a tarpinu chu ân entir a, a khawp hnunga a fâk sênglo khawm chu a phawr a, a pêk a."
"And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.","A tarpinu chun a kuomah, “Vawisûn khan khâw tienga buhnung am i zawng a? Khâwlai am sin i thawh a? A lo hre nuomtu che chu malsâwmin um raw se,” a tih a."
"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.","Ama chun tu kuom am sin a va thaw ti a tarpinu chu a hril a, “Vawisûna sin ka va thawnapa hming chu Boaz a nih,” tiin. Chun, Naomiin a monu kuoma chun, “LALPA, a lung- insietnaa mi dam le mithi thlathlam ngainawtu chun, ama chu malsâwm raw se,” a tih a. Naomi bawk chun a kuomah, “Ama chu ei inhnaipui, ei laibung bul a nih,” a tih a."
"And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.","Chun, Moab mi Ruth chun, “A ni ngei chu tie, ka kuoma khawm, ‘Ka bu hi an sîk zo vawng hmakhat chun, ka siehlawhai lai hin ṭhang ve zing rawh,’ a mi ti nghe nghe an naw,” a tih a."
"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.","Chun, Naomi chun a monu Ruth kuomah, “Ka naunu, lo danga an hmu dêr nawna ding chein, a siehlaw nunghâkhai lai ruok chun fe la ṭhang a tih,” a tih a."
"So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.","Chuongchun, buṭei le bupui sîk zo chenin, Boaz siehlaw nunghâkhai lai ruok chun buhnung zawngin a fe hlak a; chun, a tarpinu kuoma chun a um a."
"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?","Chun, a tarpinu Naomi chun a kuomah, “Ka naunu, i ta dinga khawsakna ṭha ka zawngpêk naw ding che am a nih?"
"And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.","Boaz, a siehlaw nunghâkhai laia sin i va thawnapa kha ei laibung bul a ni naw am a nih? Ngai ta, vawizân hin buṭei hrizâwlah a zâp fai ding a nih."
"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.","Insil la, sahriek innâl la, i incheina puon ṭha takhai sil la, hri- zâwla chun zu fe rawh: amiruokchu, ama chu fâk le dâwn ân zo hmakhat chu a kuomah inhriettir dêr naw rawh."
"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.","Chun, a zâl phaleh a zâlna chu inchik la, lût la, a ke hlîm la zâl rawh; chun, amain i thaw ding chu lo hril a ti che,” a tih a."
"And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.","Ruth chun a dawn a, “I hril taphawt chu thâwng ka tih,” tiin."
"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.","Chuongchun, hrizâwla chun a zu feh a, a tarpinuin a hril ang tak chun a thawh a."
"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.","Chun, Boaz chu bu a fâka a dâwn zo chun a lungril a hung hlim ta hleh a, bu hlûm bula zâl dingin a fe tah a. Ruth chu to ṭawkin a va feh a, a ke chu a hlîma a zâl ve tah a."
"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.","Zânrilah chupa chu inlâurakin a ṭhanghar a, a hei inlet a; a ke thluona nuhmei lo zâl ve zing chu a hmuh a."
"And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.","Chun, ama chun, “Tu am i nih a?” a tih a. Ama chun, “I siehlawnu Ruth ka nih, i siehlawnu hi i puon mi hung kêuzawm rawh; ka laibung bul i ni sih a,” a tih a."
"And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter: thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.","Ama chun, ka naunu LALPAIN malsâwm raw se che; tlangvâl pasie amanih hausa i zui nawa hin a hma- saa nêk hmanin a hi hnunga mia hin ṭhatna i suklang nasa ta lem a nih."
"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman.","Tuhin, “ka naunu, ṭi naw rawh; i hni taphawt thawpêk pei ka ti che; ka khaw mi chanpui po poin nuhmei feltak i nih ti an hriet seng sih a."
And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.,"Chun, tuhin, laibung bul chu ka ni ngei el; amiruokchu, keia nêka hnai lem a um a."
"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah liveth: lie down until the morning.","Vawizân chu um phawt el la, zingkâr ama chun i ta dinga laibung chan chu a thaw nuom chun ṭhang a ta, thaw raw se; amiruokchu, laibung chan chu a thawpêk nuom naw che chun, LALPA hringna sâlin, laibung chan chu thawpêk ngei ka ti che, zingkâr chenin zâl zing el rawh,” a tih a."
"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.","Chuongchun, zingkâr chenin a ke thluona chun a zâl tah a, chun tukhawm lân hmu chieng thei hmain a tho a; chun, ama chun, “Hrizâwla chun nuhmei chu a hung ti tu- khawmin hre naw raw se,” a tih a."
"And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.","Chun, “I puon bât kha hung la la dâw rawh,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a dawh a, buṭei chu tekhâwng ruk ân khi suok a, a sung a, ân phurtir a, chun, khuoa chun a fe tah a."
"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.","A tarpinu kuom a hang tlung chun, “Ka naunu, ieng am i chang a?” a lo tih a. Ama chun, chu mipain thil a thawpêk po po chu a hril vawng a."
"And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.","“Hi buṭei tekhâwng ruk hi a mi pêk a, ‘I tarpinu kuoma chun kut ruokin fe dêr naw ti nih,’ a mi ti a nih,” tiin."
"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka naunu, ieng angin am thil a hung um ding ti i hriet hma chun nghâk el rawh, vawisûn niha hi thil hi a thaw zo hmakhat chun ama chu a to el âwm si nawh a,” a tih a."
"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.","Chuongchun, Boaz chu kul kawtkhâra chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun a ṭhung a. An laibung bul Boazin a hril kha a hung chun, “Ruola, taka hin la hung la, hung ṭhung ta,” a tih a. Ama chu a va feh a, ân ṭhung a."
"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.","Chun, chu khuoa mi upa sâwm a ṭhuoi a, an kuomah, “Hitaka hin ṭhung ta u khai,” a tih a; chuongchun, an ṭhung tah a."
"And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:","Chun, an laibung bul kuoma chun, “Moab rama inthawka hung kîr nâwk Naomi chun ei unaupa Elimelek ram kha a zawr a."
"and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.","Chuleiin, hi thu hi hril cheha i kuomah, ‘Hitaka ṭhunghai mithmua le ka mihai upahai mithmua hin inchaw rawh.

Ama chun, “Intlan ka tih,” a tih a."
"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.","Boaz chun, “Naomi kuta in- thawka ram chu în châwk ni chun mithi nuhmei Moab mi Ruth în châwk sa ding a nih, amaa inthawka mithi hming chu dei loa a ro hluo ding an um theina dingin,” a tih a."
"And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.","An laibung bul chun, “Keia ta ding chun kân tlan thei nawh, keima rohluona ding tieng sukbuoi rawi ka tih, intlan theitu ka nina ai chu nangin chang el rawh, kei chun chu kân tlan thei naw a ni hi,” a tih a."
"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.","Tienlaia Israelhai laia thil iengkim an sukdetna dinga an intlan dân le an inthleng dân chu hieng hi a nih: Pakhatin kekawk a hlîp a, mi dang chu a pêk a, chu chu Israelhai laia thil sukdet dân a nih."
"So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.","Chuongchun, an laibung bul chun Boaz kuomah, “Nangin i ta dingin inchaw lem rawh,” tiin a kekawk chu a hlîp tah a."
"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.","Boaz chun upahai le mipui po po kuoma chun, “Vawisûn hin nangni hi, Elimelek thil nei po po le Kilion le Mahlon thil nei po po Naomi kuta inthawkin kân châwk tah ti hretuhai in nih."
"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.","Chu chau chu ni loin, mithi chu a hming a um zingna dinga rohluotu siempêk dingin le, mithi chu a unau- haia le a umna kul kawtkhâra a hming a bo nawna dingin, Moab nuhmei Ruth, Mahlon nuhmei chu ka nuhmei dingin kân châwk a, vawisûn hin chu hrepuituhai chu nangni hi in nih,” a tih a."
"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:","Chun, kul kawtkhâra mipui po po le upahai chun, “Hrepuituhai kan nih.

"and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman.","chun, LALPAIN hi nunghâka inthawka a thla a la siempêk ding che lei chun, i sûngkuo chu Tamarin Juda a neipêk Perez sûngkuo ang hung ni raw se,” an tih a."
"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son.","Chuleiin, Boaz chun Ruth chu a ṭhuoi a, a nuhmei a hung ni tah a; ama chu a pâwl a, LALPAIN Ruth chu nau ân paitir a, naupasal a nei tah a."
