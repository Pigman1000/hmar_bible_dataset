"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.","Uz rama chun mi pakhat a um a, a hming chu Job a nih; chu mipa chu mi fel le tluong le, Pathien ṭi a suol nghatsan mi a nih;"
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.,Ama chun naupasal pasari le naunuhmei pathum a nei a.
"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.","A ran ruol khawm chu berâm sâng sari, sanghâwngsei sâng thum, bâwngchal tuok za nga, sabengtung- pui za nga le insûng ropuitak el leh a nih; chuongchun, chu mipa chu khaw- sak rama mihai po po laia a ropui tak a nih."
And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.,"A naupasalhai chu an hunbi peiah an inhaia fein, ruoi an ṭhe insâwk hlak a: mi an tir a, an farnu pathumhai chu anni le faa dâwn dingin an ko hlak a."
"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.","Chun, an ruoiṭhena nihai vêl chu a kim pha chun Job chun ân chah a, anni chu a hlânthieng hlak a; zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, an rênga anni nizât hming kimin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai ân hlân a: Job chun, “Ka naupasalhai hin thil lo suksuol- in, an lungrilhaiah Pathien hrilsie hlau rawi an tih,” a ti sih a. Chuong ang chun Job chun a thaw rawp hlak a."
"Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.",Tuhin Pathien naupahai chu LALPA hmaa inlang dinga an hung ni a um a; Setan khawm anni lai a hung veh a.
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Nang khâwtienga inthawka hung am i na?” a ta. Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Hnuoia kân vâk vêlnaa le chutaka a suk a tunga inlawnnaa inthawkin,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.","Chun, LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Ka siehlaw Job hi i ngaituo hlak am? Hnuoi chunga hin ama anga mi fel le, mi tluong le, Pathien ṭi mi le, suol nghatsan mi an um si nawh a,” a tih a."
"Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?","Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Job chun Pathien chu teplo elin a ṭi ding maw chu?"
"Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.","Ama vêla le, a in le a nei po po, a sîr tina chun paldâi i siempêk a ni naw am a nih? A kuthai sinthaw chu mal i sâwm a, a ran ruol chu hi rama hin a hung pung tah a."
"But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin i kut phar la, a thil nei po po chu tâwk la, i hmâisanah hrilse ngei ngei a ti che,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, a thil nei po pohai chu i thuneina hnuoia um an nih; ama chunga chau chun i kut chu inlet naw rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, Setan chu LALPA hmâihmaa inthawk chun a fe suok tah a."
"And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,","Chun, ni khat chu a naupa- salhai le a naunuhmeihai chun an unaupa a upa tak ina an fâk a, uoin an dâwn laiin,"
"that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;","Job kuoma chun thangko a hung tah a, “Bâwngchalhai chun hnuoi an inlet a, an sîra chun sabeng- tunghai chu an tlah a;"
"and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","Seba mihaiin anni an thawh a, an lâk rip el a; anih, siehlawhai chu kâwlhnâm ngeiin an that a; chuong- chun, nangma hril ding chein kei chau hi ka hung inrel suok a nih,” a ta."
"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","Ama chun a la hril zing laiin mi dang khawm a hung veh a, “Vâna inthawkin Pathien mei a hung tla a, berâm ruol le siehlawhai chu a kâng a, a kâng hmang vawng tâwl el a; chuongchun, kei chau a hril ding chein ka hung suok a nih,” a ta."
"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","Ama chun a la hril lai zing chun mi dang a hung ve nâwk a, “Kaldaihai chu pâwl thumin an insiem a, sa- nghâwngseihai chu an thawh a, anni chu an lâk hmang rip el a; kâwlhnâm ngeiin siehlawhai chu an that a: a hril ding chein kei chau ka hung inrel suok a nih,” a ta."
"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;","A la hril lai zing chun mi dang khawm a hung nâwk veh a, “I naupa- salhai le i naunuhmeihai chu an unaupa upa tak inah uoin an dâwnin an fâk a:"
"and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","ngai ta, thlalêr tienga inthawk- in thli nasatak el a hung a, in kil lia chun a mût a, tlangvâlhai chu a tlûk khum a, an thi vawng tah a; a hril ding chein kei chau hi ka hung suok a nih,” a ta."
"Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;","Chun, Job chu a tho a, a puon a keithlêr a, a lu a vâwkawl a, hnuoi chunga bawkkhupin Pathien chibai a bûk tah a."
"and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.","“Ka nu phîng sûnga inthawkin saruokin ka hung suok a, saruok bawkin kîr nâwk ka tih; LALPA chun a pêk a, LALPA chun a lâk hmang nâwk tah a ni chu; LALPA hming chu inpâkin um raw se,” a ta."
"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.","Hieng thil po poa hin Job chun a suksuol nawh a, invêtthlâktakin Pathien chu a mawsiet bawk nawh."
My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.,"“Ka thlâ hin ka hringna hi a nghawk a; Ka nuom tâwkin sawisêl ka tih, Ka lungril rimsiknain thu hril ka tih."
"I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.","Pathien kuoma chun hieng hin tîng ka ta, Thiemnaw mîn changtir naw la, Keimaa hin ieng ang am i lungawi zâwng a ni mîn entir lem rawh."
"Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?","Nanga ngaiin, i nêksâwr a, I kut sinthawhai chu i hmusit a, Mi rilohai inrâwnna i sukvar chu a ṭha am a nih?"
Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth?,"Nang chun tisa mithai chu i neiin, Annawleh, i kumhai chu mihriemin an hmu angin i hmu am a nih?"
"Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as man’s days,","I nihai chu mihriemhai nihai ang am an nih? Annawleh, i kumhai chu mihriem kumhai ang am an nih?"
"That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,","Ka rîtlonahai i sui ngiel a, Ka suolna khawm i zawng rak el chu?"
"Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?","Mi rilo ka ni nawh a, I kuta inthawka mi la suok thei tukhawm an um nawh ti hre zing siin?"
Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.,"I kuthai chun a mi riruongin a mi lo siembâwl vawng tah a, Anachu nangin i mi suksiet el hi."
"Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again?","Hi hi hre zing rawh, ka ngên che hi, nang chun pilpawk angin i mi lo siembâwl tah a, Pilvuta bawk i mi ṭhuoi nâwk el ding a ni maw?"
"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?","Nang chun nênetui anga mi bunthlain, Nênetui kîng angin i mi hmet ta ni lo am a nih?"
"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.","Nang chun vun le taksain i mi lo thuom tah a, Thahruihai le ruhai chun i mi ṭhui khâwm tah."
Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.,"Hringna le ditsakna i mi lo phalpêk tah a, I vênghimna chun ka thlarau chu a lo hum a."
Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee:,"Amiruokchu, hieng thilhai hi nang chun i lungrila chun i thup a, Hi hi i kuomah a um ti ka hriet a nih."
"If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.","Ka lo suol chun, nangin i mîn chik a, Ka khawhlonaa inthawk chun thiem i mîn changtir ngai nawh."
"If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction.","Mi rilo ka ni chun, ka chung a rik a! Mi fel ni lang khawm ka lu ling naw bawk ka tih, Muolphonain ka sip a, ka tuornahai ka hmu zing leiin."
"And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.","Ka lu hi ama le ama ân chawimawi chun, sakeibaknei angin i mi pêl a, Ka chunga chun nang chu maktakin i hung inentir a."
"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me.","Ka chunga chun i thuhretuhai chu i hung sukthar a, Ka chungah i lunginsenna i sukpung a, Mi dotu pâwl dang dang i hung inumtir a."
"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.",Chuong a ni chun iengdinga sula inthawk chun i mi lo lâk suok am a na? Thlarau lo inthla ta lang mitin a mi hmu naw ding bah.
I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.,"Kei chu lo um ta lo ang nîng ka ta, Sula inthawk chun thlânah lâk hmangin lo um tâng ka tih."
"Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,","Ka nihai a tlâwm hle an nâwm a nih? Tâwp el raw se, Chitêa ka thlamuong dep theina dingin mâkhâtin mîn umtir el rawh."
"Before I go whence I shall not return, Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;","Ka hung kîr nâwk nawna dinga ka fe hma hin, Thina hlim le inthimna ram ngeia ka fe hma hin."
"The land dark as midnight, The land of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight.","Inthimna ngawta inthim sâmup ram, Thupêk hrim um lo, thina hlim ram; Var khawm inthimna ang nina hmun chu,” tiin."
"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,","Chun, Zophar Naamath mi chun a dawn a, a hril tah a;"
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?,“Thu tamtakhai hi dawn a ni ngei naw ding am a nih? Mi ṭawng tam chu thiem inchangtir a ni ding am a nih?
"Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?",Chatlakloa i ṭawng hin mihai ân to ṭawktir ding am a nih? Thamlo taka i ṭawng hin tukhawmin an sukzak naw ding che i ring maw?
"For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.","‘Ka thuring chu ân thiengin, I mithmua chun kân thieng a nih,’ i ti sih a."
"But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,","Nisienlakhawm, aw, Pathien chun hung hrilin, Nanga kalin a hmûrhai chu hung inchângtir ve sienla;"
And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.,"Varna thurûkhai chu ân entir ding che bah! Varna chu sîr tamtak a ni si a, Pathien chun i khawhlonain a phu nêka nêp lemin a thaw che a nih ti hre rawh."
Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?,A zawnga zawng ngawtin Pathien thil inthûkhai chu i hmu suok thei ding am a nih? Iengkimthawthei chu a famkimin i hmu suok thei ding am a nih?

"The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.",Chu chu lienzie chu leihnuoi nêkin a sei lemin; Tuisuoriet nêkin a lien lem a nih.
"If he pass through, and shut up, And call unto judgment, then who can hinder him?","Ama chu a fêthleng a, a khârkhip a, A ko khâwm chun tuin am dang thei an ta?"
"For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.","Mi teplohai chu a hrietin, A ngaituo naw khawma, khawhlonahai chu a hmu sih a."
"But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born as a wild ass’s colt.","Ram sabengtungtê mihriema a pieng phaleh, Mi teplo chun hrietthiemna nei chau a tih."
"If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;","I lungril chu i siem dik a, Ama tiengah i kuthai i phar chun;"
"If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.","I kuta chun khawhlona a um ruok chun, hlatakah sie dai rawh, I puon inahai chun fel nawna inchêngtir naw la;"
"Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:","Chun, matheiloin i hmai chu kaidum um hlek loin nghâng i ta, Anih, dettakin um i ta, ṭi naw ti ni."
"For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,",I rinum tuorhai chu i theinghil ta âwm sih a; Tui luong hmang tahai ang chau chun hre zing i tih.
"And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.","Chun, i hringna chu sûnchang lai nêkin hung fie lem a ta, Inthimna um sien khawm, zîngkâr ang ni tâng a tih."
"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.","Chun, beiseina a um leiin, nang chu him tâng i ta, Anih, nangma le nangma inzawng suok i ta, himtakin sâwldam tâng i tih."
"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.","Zâl i ta, tukhawma suklâu bawk naw ni hai che; Anih, mi tamtakin nangma le inremna hung siem an tih."
"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.","Nisienlakhawm, mi rilo mithai chu hung hlawsam a ta, Tlân hmangna ding lampui khawm nei naw ni hai, An beiseina khawm chu thlarau inthla ang chu nîng a tih,” tiin."
"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
"No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you.","“Mihriem chau in na, Varna chu in ruolin thi ve el a tih ti hi ringhla um lo a na."
"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?","Nisienlakhawm, nangni ang bawkin hrietthiemna ka nei veh a, Nangni nêkin kân hnuoi bîk nawh: Anih, hieng thilhai ang hi tuin am hre nâwng an ta?"
"I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.","Ka ruolhai ta dingin nuizatbûr ka hung ni tah a, Pathien ka koin, mi dawn sien khawm, Mi fel le demkailo ni lang khawm nuizatbûr el ka ni ta hi."
In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth.,Mi inhawitirhai ta ding chun vângduoina chu hmusitum a na; Mi a kehai intawlthlu ṭêp ta ding chun inzosa a nih.
"The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.","Inruhmanghai puon inhai chu a hung hlawtling a, Pathien suklungsentuhai chu an him bawk a, Chuonghai kuta chun Pathien chun tamtakin a hung vur a."
"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:","Amiruokchu, tuhin ramsahai khawm chu indawn la, inchûktir an ti che; Chunglêng vatehai khawm chu indawn la hril an ti che."
"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.","Annawleh, hnuoi kuoma chun thu hril la, inchûktir a ti che, Tuisuorieta ngahai khawm chun i kuomah hrillang an tih."
"Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,","Hienghai po poa hin, Lalpa kut chun hi hi a thaw a nih ti hre naw tu am um an ta?"
"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?","Ama kuta chun thilhring po po hringna chu a um a, Mi chi tinrênghai thlarau leh."
"Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food?","Na hin thuhai chu a fie ngai naw am a ni, Dangin bu chu ân tem ang el hin?"
"With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding.","Upaa chun varna a um a, Nihai sâwtah hrietthiemna a um bawk a."
With God is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding.,"Amaa chun varna le hrâtna a um a, Ama chun hrietthiemna le remhrietna a nei."
"Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.","Ngai ta, a suksiet a, siemṭhat thei ruol an ta nawh a; Mihriem chu a khârkhip a, ân hawngna a um thei nawh a."
"Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.","Ngai ta, tuihai chu a chelngîr a, an kang tah a; A hung tir nâwk thung a, hnuoi chu an inkhum a."
With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his.,"Amaa chun hrâtna le varna famkim chu a um a, Hlêma um le hlêmtu khawm chu ama ta bawk a nih."
"He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools.",Inrâwnkhâwmhai chu a ṭhuoi hmangin a suksiet a; Rorêltuhai chu invêt ruolah a siem tah a.
"He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.","Lalhai khuopna chu a sût a; An kâwnghai chu kâwngkhiin a khitpêk a,"
"He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty.",Thiempuhai chu ṭhuoi hmangin a suksiet a; Mi hrât chu a nam thlûk bawk a.
"He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders.",Mi ringum ṭawnghai chu a sawn hmang a; Upahai hrietthiemna chu a lâk hmang bawk a.
"He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong.","Lal nauhai chunga chun hmusitumna a buok a, Mi hrât kâwngchûn chu a sûtpêk bawk a."
"He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.",Inthima inthawkin thil inthûktakhai chu a hmu suok a; Thina varuom chu varah a hung lâk suok tah a.
"He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.","Hnamhai chu a hung sukpung a, anni a sukbohmang tah a; Hnamhai chu a hung suklien a, anni a ṭhuoi hmang hlak a."
"He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.","Hnuoia mipuihai lalhai lungril chu a lâk hmang a, Thlalêr hmun lampui um nawna hmuna chun ân vâktir hlak."
They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.,"Inthima chun var ṭhang loin an inmai a, Mi, zu inrui ang ela pêm dingin anni a siem hlak.”"
"Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it.","“Ngai ta, hi po po hi ka mit chun a hmu a nih, Ka na chun a hriet a, a ngâina khawm ka hriet tah."
"What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.",In hriet ang ang chu kei khawmin ka hriet a: Nangni nêkin kân hnuoi bîk nawh.
"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.","Amiruokchu, Iengkimthawthei kuoma chun thuhril ka nuom a, Pathien le ngaituo hmunkhat chu ka nuom a nih."
But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value.,Khêlthuahai khêlhriltuhai chau in ni hi; Damdawi thiem mi ṭhangkaina um si lohai vawng in nih.
Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.,"Aw, in rêngin to ṭawk ṭawk lem unla chu! In varna ni lem a tih."
"Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.","“Ka ngaituona hi hre unla, Ka hmûrhaiin a hninahai chu ngai ta u."
"Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?","Pathien ta ding chun fel lotaka thu hrilin, Ama ta ding chun hmusitumtakin in ṭawng ding maw?"
Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?,A mi hi in inza naw ding am a nih? Pathien ta ding chun in kal ding maw?
"Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?","A zawng suok el cheu chu a ṭha am a nih? Annawleh, miin mi dang a hlêm angin, ama chu in hlêm el ding maw?"
"He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show partiality.","Ama chun matheiloin kâwk a ti cheu, Mihai chu inrûka in ditsak bîk chun."
"Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?","A ṭhat famkimna chun a sukṭi cheuin, A ṭitumna chu in chungah a tla naw ding am a nih?"
"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.","In thuhril hriet zing dinghai hlak chu vut thuvarhai an na, in inhumna hlak chu pilpawk inhumna a nih."
"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will.","To ṭawk unla, makhâtin mîn umtir ro, thu ka hril theina dingin, Ieng po khawm ka chungah tlung el raw se."
"Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?","Iengkhawm tlung sien, ka taksa chu ka hahaia sein, Ka hringna chu ka kutah ka sie el dîm a nih?"
"Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.","Ama chun mi sukhlum sien khawm, ama chu la beisei rawp ka tih. A hmabulah ka thiemna thu ka la hril ding a ni si a."
"This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.",Hi hi ka sandamna chu nîng a ta; Pathien ngaisak naw mi chu a hmaa hin a hung âwm si nawh a.
"Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.","Nguntakin ka thuhrilhai hi ngai unla, Ka hrilfiena hi in nahaia chun lût raw se."
"Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.","Tuhin, ngai ta u, ka chungthua thu ka siemfel tah a, Thiem chang ka tih ti ka hriet."
Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.,"Tuin am mi sêl a ta? Tuhin to ṭawk ka ta,ka thlarau kân thla ding a ni sih a."
Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:,"Thil pahni hi ka chungah thaw naw la, Chuongchun, i hmaa inthawkin inbihmang naw ning."
Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid.,"Keimaa inthawkin i kut chu hlatakah la hmang la, I ṭiumna chun mi suklâu ta naw raw se."
"Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me.","Chun, mi hung ko la, hung dawn ka ta; Annawleh, thu min hriltir la, nangin mi hung dawn rawh."
How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.,Ka suolnahai le ka khawhlonahai chu iengzât am an na? Ka suolna le ka bawsietna chu mîn hriettir rawh.
"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy?","Iengdinga nangin i hmai i thup a, I hmêlma anga i mi ngai am?"
Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?,Hna inhnîng inhnîng hi i thlam el ding maw? Bupâwl bul ṭâwl chu i hnawt i hnawt ding maw?
"For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:","Nang chun ka chungah thil khatakhai chu i ziek a, Ka tleirâwl lai khawhlonahai ro chu hluo dingin i mi siem a."
"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:","Ka kehai chu kawl în buntir a; Ka lampuihai chu în chik vawng a, Ka kepha vêl po poa chun ramri i siekhum bawk a."
"Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.","Mi chu thil hmawn bohmang el hlak ang a nih, Silfên hângthim ifâksiet ang chu."
"Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.","“Mi nuhmei inei taphawt chu, Ni sâwtnawtêa ding, buoinaa sip a nih."

"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.","Ka bawsietna chu ipa khitkhum a na, Nangin ka khawhlona chu i ṭhuikhum a."
But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;,"Matheiloin tlâng chu chimin teplo hung nîng a ta, Lungpui khawm chu a hmuna inthawka sawn nîng a tih."
The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man.,"Tuihai chun lunghai chu an hrût hek a, Tui inkhâwhai chun hnuoia pil chu an lên hmang a, Chun, nang chun mihriem beiseina chu i sukbo a."

"Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.","Rimsikna le lungngainahai chun ama a sukṭih a; Lal indo dinga inzosa hieu angin ama chu an inhuol a,"
"Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;","Pathien chungah a kut ân let lei le, Iengkimthawthei chunga chapotaka a khawsak leiin."
"He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;","Ama chunga chun kâwmâwtakin a tlân a, A phaw laipâwng sâtak le chun."
"Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;","A thâuna chun a hmai chu ân khum leiin, A diemnêma chun thâu a seng a;"

I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.,"“Chuong thilhai tamtak chu ka hriet tah a, Thlamuongtu nghawkum in ni vawng a nih."
Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?,"Teplo thuhai chun tâwp an nei ding am a nih? Annawleh, dawn dingin iengin am a suktho che a?"
"I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.","Ka nina hi in nina ni sienla chu, In ṭawng ang bawkin ka ṭawng thei a, In chungah thuhai ka zawmkhâwm thei a, In chungah ka lu ka thin el thei a nih."

"Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?","“Thu ka hrila chu ka lungngaina chu suknêp a ni nawh a, Ka tuor fan fana chu, ieng am ka sâwldam chuong a?"
But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.,"Amiruokchu, tuhin a mi sukrimsitu hin, Ka ruolhai po po chu i mîn pâwlsertir zo an ta hi."
"And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.","Keima chu inchuornain i mi suksip a, Chu chu ka chunga hrietpuinahai chu an nih, Chun, ka derdêpna chu ka chungah a tho a, Ka hmaisan ngeiah a mi kâwk a."
"He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.","A lunginsenin a mi kei nâwi a, a mi hrem tah a; Ka chunga chun a ha a mi râwt khum a, Ka hmêlma chun ka chungah a mitsîr a sukngei a."
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.,Ka chungah an bau an mi kâk khum a; Hmusittakin ka biengah an mi ben a; Ka chunga chun anni chu an pungkhâwm a.
"God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.","Pathien chun Pathien ngaisak nawhai kuoma chun a mi pêk suok a, Mi rilohai kutahai chun a mi pei lût tah a."
"I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.","Sâwldamin ka um a, ama chun a mi kei nâwi neng a, Anih, ka rîngah a mi man a, innâwi nengin a mi pei tah a. Ama inchikna dinga chun a mi sie ta bawk a."

He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.,"A hlawp hlawpin a mi kei nâwi a, Mi hrât angin ka chunga chun a mi chîl thlûk tah a."
"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.","Ka vun chunga dingin saiip puon ka ṭhui a, Ka ki chu pilvutah ka sukbal tah a."
"My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;","Ka hmai chu ṭapnain a hung sen a, Ka mitreiahai chun thina hlim chu a um a;"
"Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.","Ka kutahai chun inrawmna a um naw a, Ka ṭawngṭaina chu ân thieng a."
"O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place.","“Aw leihnuoi, ka thisen chu inkhum naw la, Ka ṭapna chun châwlhmun nei naw raw se."

"That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!",Ama chun mihriem nau thuneina chu Pathien kuomah ṭan ta ve sien chu aw! Miin a vênghai a ṭan ang chun.
"For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.","Kum tlâwmte a hung ni pha chun, Lampui ka kîr nâwk nawna dinga chun ka fe âwm sih a."
"My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.","“Ka thlarau chu a kawidar a, ka nihai chu a hung bo tah a, thlân chu keia ta dingin inzosa a nih."
"Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.","Matheiloin, ka kuoma hin nuisantuhai an um a nih, An suklungsennaa chun ka mit chu a châm zing a nih."
"Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?","“Tuhin intiemna siem la, nangma chu ring tlat ngamna che mi siempêk rawh. Chutaka chun tu am kuthai mi benpui ding an um a?"
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.,"An lungril chu nangin hrietnaa inthawkin i thuppêk sih a, Chuleiin, nangin anni chu chawimawi naw ti nih."
"He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.","Fâk dinga a ruolhai inthlim chu, A nauhai mithai ngei khawm chu la hlawsam a tih."
But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.,Ama chun mihai hrilinsîmah a mi siem a; Mî chil sâk khum ka hung ni ta hi.
"Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.",Lungngaina leiin ka mit khawm a hung inthim a; Ka taksaa bunghai po po khawm chu hlim ang an nih.

"Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.","Mi fel chun a lampui chu chel zing a ta, Kut faihai neitu chu hung hrât deu deu a tih."
"But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you.","Amiruokchu, in rêngin kîr unla, tuhin hung ro: Nangni lai mi var ka hmu thei si nawh a,"
"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.","Ka nihai chu a liem a, ka thiltumhai chu a hung seh a, Ka lungril ngaituohai ngei chu."
"They change the night into day: The light, say they, is near unto the darkness.","Zân chu sûnah an inchangtir a: ‘Var chun inthim a hnai tah,’ an tih a."
If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;,"Seol chu ka in anga ka en chun, Inthima chun ka ṭhunghmun chu ka rem chun;"
"If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;","Khur kuoma chun, ‘Ka pa i nih’ ka tih a, Nge kuoma chun, ‘Ka nu le ka farnu i nih’ ka ti bawk chun,"
"Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?",Ka beiseina chu khâwlai am ni tâng a ta? Ka beiseina chu tuin am hmu tâng a ta?

"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.","Anih, mi rilohai varna chu sukthim ni ngei a ta, A meisi khawm chu de ta naw nih."
"The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out.","A puon ina var chu inthim a ta, A khâwnvar chu ama chunga chun herhlum nîng a tih."
"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.","Chun, a hrâtna kalchawihai chu suktâwi nîng a ta. Ama thurâwn ngei chun ama chu pei thlâng a tih."
"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.",Ama kehai ngei chun lêna chun a âwk a; Châng chunga chun a fe sih a.

"The members of his body shall be devoured, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.","A taksa pênghai chu fa zo vawng a ta, Anih, thina nau lutîr chun a pênghai chu fa zo vawng a tih."
He shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.,"A ringpui puon ina inthawk chun phawi suok nîng a ta, Ṭitumnahai lal kuoma chun hung ṭhuoi ni bawk a tih."
There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.,"A puon ina chun ama mi ni ngai hlek lo chu chêng a ta, A chêngna hmuna chun meitâwklunghai thêdarin um a tih."
"His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off.","A hnuoi tiengah a zunghai chu ṭâwl a ta, A chungtieng chun a kau chu vuoi bawk a tih."
"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street.","Ama hriet zingna chu hnuoi chunga inthawkin bohmang a ta, Kawtthlêra khawm chun hming hrim nei naw ni."
"He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.","Vara inthawkin inthimah hnawt hmang nîng a ta, Khawvêla inthawka hnawt suok ni bawk a tih."

"He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.","Ka lua inthawk chun ka lallukhum chu la hmangin, Ka ropuina chu a mi hlîppêk ta a ni hi."
"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.","Kil tina chun a mi hung suksiet a, chuongchun, kei chu ka fe liem tah a; Ka beiseina khawm chu thing ang elin a lâk hmang tah a."
"He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.","A lunginsenna chu ka chungah a sukchawk a, A hmêlma pakhat ang chun a mi ngai tah a."

"My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me.","Ka laibunghai hlakin an mi nghatsan a, Ka ruol pâwlngeihai hlakin an mi theinghil ta bawk a."
"They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.","Ka ina mikhuolhaiin an mi theinghil a, ka siehlawnuhai hlakin ram dang mi angin an mi ngai a,"
"I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, Though I entreat him with my mouth.","Ka siehlaw chu ka ko a, a mi dawn hrim hrim nawh a, Ama chu bauṭhaa ka ngên a lo ṭûl ta lem a."
"My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.","Ka thuok chu ka nuhmei kuoma chun mak a lo ni tah a, Ka nu rîla rahai ngei kuoma ka hnina khawm chu nghawkum a lo ni tah a."
"Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me.","Naupanghai khawm chun an mi hmusit a, Ka tho leh, ka chungah an mi sawisêl a."
"All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.","Ka ruol bulhai po po hlak chun an mi pâwlser a, Ka hmangai takhai khawm chu ka chungah an hel a."
"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.","Ka vun le ka tisa hi ka rua chun a kawp ringawt a, Ka hahai vun ruok chu ka la chang a."
"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me.","Aw nangni ka ruolhai, mi lunginsiet ro, mi lunginsiet ro, Pathien kut chun a mi hung tâwk ta sih a."
"Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?","Pathien ang el chun iengdinga in mi hrem a, Ka tisaa hin lungawi tâwk lo am in nih a?"
Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!,"“Aw ka thuhai hi tuhin ziekin um sien, Aw, lekhabua chun ziek tlatin um hai sien chu aw!"
That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!,"Thîr le suon kawlawm chun ziekin um sien, Lungpuia chun kumkhuoa dingin kerin um hai sien chu!"
"But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth:","Amiruokchu, ka tlantu chu a hring a nih ti ka hriet a, A tâwpa chun hnuoi chunga hin la ngîr ngei a tih."
"And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;","Chuong anga ka vun chena sukbohmang a ni hnung khawm chun, Ka taksa ngei chun Pathien chu la hmûng ka tih."
"Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.","Ama chu ka ta ding ngeiin hmu tâng ka ta, Ka mithai chun en a ta, mi dang chu en naw ni. Ka lungril chu ka sûnga chun ân tuiral a."
"If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;","‘Iengtin am ama chu sukrimsîng ei ti aw! Amaa chun hi thil zung hi hmusuok a nih,’ in ti chun,"
"Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment.","Kâwlhnâm chu ṭi ro. Lunginsenna chun kâwlhnâma hremnahai chu a hung lâk suok hlak sih a; Rorêlna chu a um ti in hriet theina dingin,” tiin."
"Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.","Ni khat chu Pathien naupahai chu LALPA hmaa an hung inlang- na ni a um nâwk a, Setan khawm chu anni laia LALPA hmaa inlang dingin a hung veh a."
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Nang khâwtienga inthawka hung am i na?” a ta. Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Hnuoia kân vâk vêlnaa le chutaka a suk a tunga inlawnnaa inthawkin,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Ka siehlaw Job hi i ngaituo hlak am? Hnuoi chunga hin ama anga mi fel le mi tluong, Pathien ṭi mi le suol nghat- san mi an um si nawh a; a san nei loa ama sukbohmang dinga a chungah i mîn chângtir khawma ama chun a ringumna chu a chel det tlat a nih,” a tih a."
"And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.","Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Vun aiah vun; anih, miin a thil nei po po chu a hringna dingin a pêk phal âwm hrim a nih."
"But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.","Tuhin i kut inlet la, a ru le taksa chu tâwk la, i hmâisanah hrilse ngei ngei a ti che,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.","LALPA chun Setan kuomah, “Ngai ta, ama chu i kuta um a nih annâwm; a hringna chau chu hla la,” a ta."
"So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.","Chuongchun, Setan chu LALPA hmâihmaa inthawk chun a fe suok tah a, Job chu a kephaa inthawka a lusîp chenin khuoihli pânnain a hrem tah a."
And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.,Ama chun ama le ama ân huotna dingin bekawihâr a lâk a; vut lai chun a ṭhung tah a.
"Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.","Chun, a nuhmei chun a kuomah, “I ringumna chu i la chel det tlat el a ni maw? Pathien chu hrilse la, thi el rawh,” a ta."
"But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei invêt thuhril angin thu i hril a nih. Iengdingin am Pathien kuta inthawka thil ṭha ei hmu chun, thil ṭha naw khawm ei hmu naw ding am a nih?” a ta. Hieng thilhai po poa khawm hin Job chun a hmûrhai khawmin thil a suksuol nawh a."
"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.","Chuongchun, Job ruol pathum hai chun ama chunga thil ṭha naw tlunghai po po chu an lo hriet chun, an hmun senga inthawk chun an rêngin an hung seng a; Eliphaz Teman mi le, Bildad Suhi mi le Zophar Naamath mi an nih; ama chu thlamuon ding le tuorpui dinga hung dingin hun rem an ruot tlâng a."
"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.","Chuongchun, râl hlataka in- thawka an mithai an hei inlên chun, ama chu an hriet nawh a, an khêk rak rak a, an ṭap tâwl tah a; an puonhai chu an keithlêr tâwl a, pilvut vân- vawrin an luhai an inthêkhum a."
"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.","Chuongchun, ama kuoma chun hnuoi chungah ni sari le zân sari an ṭhung a, a tu khawm chun a kuomah iengkhawm an hril nawh a; a lung- ngaina chu a nasa êm êm a nih ti an hmu sih a."
"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,","Chun, Zophar Naamath mi chun a dawn a, a hril tah a."
"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.","“Chuleiin, ka ngaituonahai chun dawnna a mi pêk a nih, Keimaa inhmâwnatak um lei ngei chun."
I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.,"Kâwkna mi sukzaktak el chu ka lo hriet tah a, Ka hrietthiemna thlarau chun a mi hung dawn tah a nih."
"Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,","Tienlaia hi thil hi i hriet naw a ni maw, Mihriem chu hnuoi chunga sie a nia inthawk tah,"
"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?","Mi rilohai hnêna chu a tâwi hlak a, Pathien ngaisak lohai hlimna khawm chu mitkhapkâr chau a ni hlak ti hi?"
"Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;","A ṭhatna chu vân tawngin intieng sienla khawm, A lu chun sûmhai tawng sienla khawm,"
"Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?","Ama êk ang el chun la hung bohmang ngei a ta, Ama lo hmu hlaktuhai chun, ‘Khâwlai am a um tah a?’ tîng an tih."
"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.","Mang ang elin vuong hmang a ta, hmu ruol ni ta naw ni, Anih, Zâna mitthlaa thilhmuhai ang el chun hnawt hmang ni tâng a tih."
The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.,"Mit ama lo hmu ta hlak khawm chun hmu ta naw nih a, Ama hmun khawm chun hmu ta ngai hrim hrim naw ni."
"His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth.","A thlahai chun mi rimsihai ditsakna chu zawng tâng an ta, A kuthai chun a hausakna chu pe kîr tâng a tih."
"His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.","A ruhai chu a tleirâwlnaa sip a na, Nisienlakhawm, ama leh pilvuta chun zâl tâng a tih."
"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,","“Rîtlona chu a bauah thlum sien khawm, A lei hnuoia chun thup hlak sienla khawm;"
"Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;","Hla zingin, insuoktir hlek loin, A bau sûnga chun kawl zing ta sienla khawm;"
"Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.","A bu chu a rîlhai sûnga chun la hung inlet a ta, A sûnga chun rûl tûr hung ning a tih."
"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.","Hausaknahai chu a dawl tah a, hung luok suok nâwk a tih, Pathien chun a phîng sûnga inthawkin hung pei suok a tih."
He shall suck the poison of asps: The viper’s tongue shall slay him.,"Rûl tûr chu fâwp a ta, Rûlriel tûrin ama chu sukhlum a tih."
"He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.","Vadunghai chu en ta ngai naw nih a, Nênetui khal le khuoizu tui luonghai chu."
"That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.","A sininrimna bêk bêk, ra chu pe kîr a ta, lem thla el naw ni, Thil a nei ang hu peiah ama chu hlim naw ni."
"For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.","Mi rimsihai chu a nghatsanin, a nêksâwr a, In dâm chu a pâwng lâk a, a ibâwl naw khawm,"
"Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.","A duâmna chun to ṭawk ṭawk hrim a hriet naw leiin, A lâwmna tak thil chu hmu bawk naw nih."
There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.,"A fâk zo naw dinga hla hrim thil a um nawh a, Chuleiin, a hausakna chun dai sâwt naw nih."
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.,"A hau tâwk zet huna chun inrêkin um a ta, Mi rimsihai kut chu a chungah hung tlung a tih."
"When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating.","A phîng chu suksip ding a ni phingleh, Pathien chun a lungsen ṭiumna chu a chungah buok a ta, A fâk lai chun a chungah a sûrin sûr a tih."
"He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through.","Thîr hriemhreia inthawkin tlânsieng a ta, Dârsen thalngul chun ama kâp thleng a tih."
"He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him.","A hnûk dawk a, a taksaa inthawk chun a hung suok a; Anih, a hmawrzum tlê chu a mîtkhaa inthawkin a hung suok a, Ṭitumhai chu ama chunga chun a um a nih."
All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown by man shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent.,"Inthimna po po chu a rohai dingin siekhâwl a na; Mei, mihriem isêm loin kâng hmang a ta; A puon ina mâksan a la mahla khawm chu kâng hmang a tih."
"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.","Vânhai chun a suolnahai chu suklang a ta, Hnuoi chun ama chunga chun do a tih."
The increase of his house shall depart; His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.,"A in hlâwkna chun ama mâksan a ta, A lunginsen nia chun a thuomhnawhai chu luong hmang a tih."
"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.","Hi hi Pathiena inthawka mi rilo chan chu a nih, Pathienin a rochan dinga a ruotpêk chu,” tiin."
"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.,"“Ka ṭawng hi nguntakin lo ngai unla, Hi hi in inhnêmna chu ni raw se."
"Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.","Mi phal unla, kei khawma thu hril vêng ka tih, Ka hril zoah mi nuisan de ti niu."
"As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?","Ka chungthua chun, ka chierna hi mihriem chung am a nih? Iengdingin am lunginrawm loin um ka ta?"
"Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.","Mi en unla, makti unla, in kutin in bau chu hup el ro."
"Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh.","Ka ngaituoin ka lung a zîng a, Ṭitnain ka tisaah a mi man hlak."
"Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?","Iengtiziea mi rilo chu hringin, an hung tarin, thilthawtheinaa an hung nasa hlak am a na?"
"Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.","An thlahai chu anni mithmu ngeia anni le tungding an na, An chithlahai an mithmu ngeiah, tungding an nih."
"Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.","An inhai chu ṭitnaa inthawkin a him a, Pathien hmawl khawm chu an chungah a um bawk nawh."
"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.","An bâwngchalhai chun chi an thlah a, an ching ngai nawh a, An bâwngpuihai chun tê an nei a, tê an insiet ngai nawh."
"They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.","An nauhai chu berâm ruol angin an tir suok a, An nauhai chu an lâm a."
"They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.","Ṭingṭang le khuongtê leh hla an sak a, Theihle ria chun an hlim bawk a."
"They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.","An nihai chu neinungtakin an hmang zo a, Thlamuongtakin Seola chun an fe thla tah a."
"And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.","Pathien kuoma chun, ‘keinia inthawkin fe hmang rawh, I lampuihai hrietna chu kan châk naw a nih,’ an la ti ta rawp a."
"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?","‘Iengkimthawthei chu tu am a ni leh, a rawng ei bâwl ding chu? A kuoma ei ṭawngṭaiin ieng am ṭhathnemna hmûng ei ta?’ tiin."
"Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.","En ta u, an hausakna chu an kutah a um nawh a; Mi rilo thurâwn chu keimaa inthawka hlataka chun a um a nih."
How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That God distributeth sorrows in his anger?,Mi rilohai khâwnvar chu ieng anga herhlum rawpin am a um a? An sietna khawm chu ieng angin am a hung rawp ding? Pathien khawm chun a lunginsenin lungngainahai a pêk tâwl chu?
"That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?","Thli hmaa pâwl kûng ang el an na, Busi thliin a lên hmang hlak ang chu an nih."
"Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:","‘Pathien chun a thlahai ta dingin a khawhlona chu a khâwlkhâwm,’ in ta, An hriet theina dingin an chunga ngei chun thung ni raw se."
"Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.","An mithai chun an sietna ngei chu hmu sienla, Iengkimthawthei lunginsenna ngei chu indâwntirin um raw hai se,"
"For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?","An thi hnung chun an insûng chu ieng dim ni tâng an ta, An ta dinga thla tiem zât a bo hnung chun?"
"Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high?","Mi tukhawmin Pathien chu hrietthiemna ân chûktir ding am a nih, Mi insânghai chunga chun ro a rêl ti hmu siin?"
"One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:","Mi chu a hrât lai takin a thih a, To ṭawk ṭawk le sâwldam rawng rawnga umin."
"His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.","A taksa chu thâuin a sip a, A ruhai thlin chu a tlawr bawk a."
"And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good.","Chun mi dang lungngaitakin a thih a, Thil ṭha hrim hrim ân tem ngai nawh."
"They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.","Pilvuta chun angkhat charin an zâl ve veh a, Anni chu ngehai chun ân khum a nih."
"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.","Ngai ta u, in ngaituohai ka hriet deh Keima chunga indik nawtaka inngaituona remruotnahai le chun."
"For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?",‘Lalnau in chu khâwlai am a na? Mi rilo umna puon in chu khâwlai am a na?’ in ti sih a.
"Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,",Lampuia mi inlawnhai chu in indawn naw am a nih? An thuhrilhai chu in pawm naw am a nih?
That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?,"Mi suol chu suksietna nia dinga khêk a na, Ṭhuoihmangin an um a, lunginsenna nia dingin."
Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?,Tuin am a lampui chu a hmaisana chun hrilfieng a ta? A thil lo thaw ta chu tuin am thungpêk a ti leh?
"Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb.","Thlâna chun ama chu phur hmang la nîng a ta, Thlân in chunga chun la nghâk an tih."
"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.","Varuom piltlanghai chu ama ta dingin inhnik a ta, Chun, mi po po chun ama hnung chu zui an tih, A hmaa mi tiem sêng lo lo um tahai ang khan."
"How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?","Anleh, iengtin am teplo chun mi thlamuon in ta, In dawnnahaia chun khêl ngawt naw chu iengkhawm a um nawh,” tiin."
"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,","Chun, Eliphaz Teman mi chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.,“Mihriem chu Pathien ta dingin a ṭhahnem thei ding am a nih? Matheiloin mi var chun ama le ama ân ṭhathnempui hlak ngei a.
"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?","Mi fel i ni hi Iengkimthawthei ta ding chun ieng am lâwmna ding a um a? Annawleh, i lampuihai chu i sukṭha famkim hin ama ta dingin hlâwkna a um am a nih?"
"Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?","Ama i ṭi leiin a hrem chein, Rorêlnaah a ṭhuoi lût che am a nih?"
Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.,I rîtlona hi a nasa êm êm a ni naw am a nih? I suolnahai chun tâwp chin a nei bawk si nawh a.
"For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing.","I unau thuomhnaw chu teplo khatin i lâk a, Saruokhai chu an silfên i hlîppêk bawk sih a."
"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.","Mi chauhai kuoma chun tui dâwn ding i pêk nawh a, Mi phîngṭamhai ta dingin bei în ro bawk a."
"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.","“Amiruokchu, mi thahrât chun chu hnuoi hi a nei a, Mi inzaum chu a sûnga chun a chêng a nih."
"Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.","Hmeithaihai chu kut ruokin în fe hmangtir a, Naufahrahai kuthai chu sukthliekin a um bawk a."
"Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee,","Chuleiin, chânghai chu i sîrvêlah a um vawng a nih. Ṭit thutna chun a sukbuoi bawk cheh a."
"Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee.","I hmu thei nawna dingin i var chu sukthimin a um a, Tui tamtak chun ân khum che a nih."
"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!","Pathien chu vân insânga chun a um a ni naw am a nih? Arasihai insângzie chu ngaituo ta, an insângzie chu!"
"And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?","Nang chun, ‘Pathien chun ieng am a hriet a? Inthim sâmupah ro a rêl thei ding am a nih?"
"Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven.","Sûm sâmuphai chu ama inkhumna a na, a hmu thei nawh, Vân vêla chun a fe hlak a nih,’ i ta."
Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?,"Lampui hlui kha i hraw zing ding maw, Mi rilohai lo fena ta kha?"
"Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,","Chuonghai chu an hun hmain lâk hmangin an um a, Chuonghai lungphûm chu tuihnâr anga bunthlâk a ni ta kha."
"Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?","Pathien kuomah, ‘Keini mi mâksan rawh, Iengkimthawthei chun kan chungah ieng am thaw thei a ta?’ tituhai chu."
Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.,"An inhai chu thil ṭhahaiin a la suksip rawp a, Amiruokchu, mi rilo thurâwn chu keimaa inthawkin hlatakah a um a nih."
"The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,","Mi felhai chun, chu chu an hmu a, an lâwm a, Mi pawitâwklohai chun hmusitin an nuisan a,"
"Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.","‘Eini mi kaltuhai kha sât thlâk an ni ta ngei el a, Anni a la mahlahai khawm chu meiin a kâng hmang a,’ tiin."
"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee.","Tuhin ama le chun inhmêlhriettir la, inremin um rawh, Chuongchun, i ta dingin thil ṭha a hung tlung ding annâwm."
"Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.","A baua inthawka inchûktirna chu pawm la, A thuhai chu i lungrilah sie khâwl rawh."
"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.","Iengkimthawthei kuomah i kîr nâwk chun, tung ding nîng i ta, I puon inhaia inthawka fel nawna chu hlatakah i sie hmang phawt chun."
"And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;","I hausakna chu pilvuta siein, Ophir rângkachakhai khawm chu vadungtê lunghai lai chun sie rawh."
"And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee.","Chuongchun, Iengkimthawthei chu i ro hung nîng a ta, I ta dingin tangkaruo hlutak hung nîng a tih."
"For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.","Chun, nang chu Iengkimthawtheia chun hlim tâng i ta, Chun, i hmai chu Pathien tieng ngha tâng i tih."
"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows.","I ṭawngṭaina chu ama kuomah siem i ta, ama chun dawn a ti che; Chun, thutiemhai chu ama pe tâng i tih."
"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways.","Thil hung ngiet i ta, chu chu nanga ta dinga thaw ni tâng a tih: Chun, i lampuihaia chun var ta bawk a tih."
"When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; And the humble person he will save.","Pathienin mi chapo chu a sukhnuoi a, Mi inngaitlâwm ruok chu a sandam a."
"He will deliver even him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.","Ama chun pawitâwklo mi ni lo khawm chu sanhim a ta, I kuthai inthiengna leiin sanhim a ni ding a nih,” tiin."
"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a,"
Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.,“Vawisûn ngei khawm hin ka chierna chu a kha a nih. Kân rûm zing khawmin a kut chu a rik hleh a.
Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!,"Aw, ama chu ka hmusuok theina hmun chu hre lang chu, A ṭhungphaa ngei chun ka fe thei ding bah!"
"I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.","A hmaa chun ka chungthu chu intlun ka ta, Ka bau chu insêlnain suksip ka tih."
"I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.","Thu a mi dawnnahai chu hrieng ka ta, Keia kuoma a hrilhai khawm chu hrethiem ka tih."
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.,"A thilthawtheina ropui le chun a mi kal ding am a nih? Kal lo e, kei chu mi ngaisak lem a tih."
There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.,"Chutaka chun mi tluong chun ama le chun ngaituo thei an ta, Chuongchun, ka rorêltua inthawkin kumkhuoin suok tâng ka tih."
"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;","Ngai ta u, hmatieng ka feh a, nisienlakhawm, chutaka chun ama a um nawh a. Chun, hnungtieng ka feh a, nisienlakhawm, ama ka hmu thei si nawh a."
"On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.","Vawitiengah, sin a thaw lai chun, nisienlakhawm, ama ka hmu thei si nawh, Changtienga chun ama chu a lo inbi zing a, ka hmu thei naw a nih."
"But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.","Amiruokchu, ama chun lampui ka hraw chu a hriet a, Amain a mi fie pha chun, rângkachak angin hung suok ka tih."
"My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.","Ka ke chun a kehnunghai chu a zui tlat a, A lampui chu ka zui a, ka fe pêt ngai nawh."
I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.,"A hmûrhaia inthawka thupêkhaia inthawk chun ka fe pêt ngai nawh a, Ka fâk ding pawimaw nêka nasa lemin a baua thuhai chu ka sie khâwl lem a."
"But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu ngaituona thleng lo a na, tuin am ama chu herhmang thei a ta? A lungrilin a nuomtak chu, chu ngei chu a thaw hlak."
For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.,"Thil keia ta dinga ruothai chu a thaw sih a, Chuong ang thil tamtak chu ama kuomah a um a nih."
"Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.","Chuleiin, a hmaihmaa chun ka buoi hlak a; Ka ngaituo châng chun, ama chu ka ṭi hlak."
"For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;","Pathien chun ka lungril chu a sukchâuin, Iengkimthawthei chun a mi sukbuoi hlak."
"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.","Inthimna chun a mîn huolvêl a, Inthim sâmup chun ka hmai ân khum si a."
Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days?,“Iengkimthawthei chun ieng- dinga rorêlna hunhai chu a ruot naw am a na? Iengdinga ama hretuhai chun a nihai chu an hmu naw am a na?
"There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.","Mihaiin ramrihai an sawn hmang a, Berâm ruolhai chu an pâwng lâk a, an châwm a."
They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.,"Fahra sabengtung chu an khal hmang a, Hmeithai bâwngchal chu bat aiah an lâkpêk bawk a."
They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves.,"Mi tlasam chu lampuia inthawkin an hnawt hmang a, Hnuoia mi rimsihai chu an inbi hmunkhat tâwl a."
"Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children.","Ngai ta u, thlalêra ram sabengtunghai angin, Fâk ding taimataka zawngin, an sinthaw ding chun an fe suok a; An nauhai ta ding chun thlalêr chun bu a pêk a."
They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked.,"Mi tin chun an loa bu chu an sîk a, Mi rilohai grêp lâk mahla chu an sîk bawk a."
"They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.","Zânkhawvârin puon boin an zâl a, Deia chun inkhumna ding khawm an nei nawh a."
"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.","Tlânghai raw sûrahai chun an huh a, Inhumhimna ditin lungpui chu an bêl a."
"There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;","Naute pa nei lo chu nênea inthawkin an lâk hmang a, Mi rimsi naute chu bat aiin an lâkpêk a."
"So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves.","Chuleiin, silfên tlasamin saruokin an invâk a, Buphalhai an put a, nisienlakhawm, an phîng a ṭâm zing a."
"They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.","An in huon sûngah hriek an siem a, Uoin sâwrnahai chu an chîl a, nisienlakhawm, dangchâr an tuor a."
"From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly.","Khawpuia inthawk chun thisâwnghai chu an inrûm a, Mi hliem hringna chu ṭhangpuina ngênin a khêk suok a. Amiruokchu, Pathien chun an ngênna chu a bengkhawn nawh."
"These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof.","Var chunga helhai chu an um a, Chutaka lampui chu an hriet nawh a, Chutaka lampuihaia chun an chêng bawk nawh."
The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.,"Tuolthattu chu vârṭiena thoin, mi tlasam le pasie chu a that a; Zân huna chun inru ang a nih."
"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face.","Uiretu mit khawm chun zân thim chu a nghâk a, ‘Mitin mi hmu naw ni,’ tiin: Chuongchun, a hmêl chu a sukdanglam tah a."
In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.,"Inthima chun inhai chu an chotlang a, Sûn hun sûnga chun an inkhârkhum a; Var hrim an hriet nawh."
For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.,"Zîngkâr chu an rênga ta ding chun thîna hlim ang a na, Thina hlim ṭitumnahai chu an nêl sih a."
Swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards.,"Tuihai chungzâwla hrâttaka lên an na; An chan chu hnuoia chun ṭawngseinphur a na, Grêp huonhai lampui tieng chun a fe nawh a."
Drought and heat consume the snow waters: So doth Sheol those that have sinned.,"Lum le sa chun vûr tuihai chu a lâk hmang a, Chuong ang bawk chun thil suksuoltuhai chu Seol chun a thaw a nih."
The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.,"Sul chun ama chu theinghil a ta, nge chun inhniktakin ama fâng a tih, Ama chu hriet zing khawm ni ta naw ni; Chun, fel nawna chu thing anga sukthliek ni bawk a tih."
"He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow.","Ra insuo ngailo, ching chu a fâk zo a, Hmeithai kuoma chun thil ṭha a thaw ngai nawh."
Yet God preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.,"Pathien chun a thilthawtheina chun mi hrât chu a nun a suksei a, Mi tukhawma hring an ring ta naw khawm chu a keitho hlak."
"God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways.","Hima um dingin Pathien chun anni a pêk a, chutaka chun an sâwldam hlak, Chun, a mithai khawm chu an lampuihaia chun a um zing hlak."
"They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.","Chawimawiin an um a, sâwtnawtê sûng chu, chun, an fe liem hlak a, Anih, siehnuoiin an um a, mi danghai ang bawka lampuia inthawka lâk suokin an um hlak a, Chun, buvui hmawrhai anga ât thlâkin an um hlak."
"And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?",Chuong chu a ni naw chun tuin am khêlhlipah mi sie thei an ta? Ka ṭawng khawm chu hlutna nei hlek loah tuin am mi sie thei a ta?” tiin.
"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,","Chun, Bildad Suhi mi chun a dawn a, a hril tah a,"
Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places.,“Rorêlna le ṭitna chu ama kuoma chun a um a; A hmun insângahai chun inremna a siem a.
Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?,A sipaihai chu iengzât tawp am an ni leh? Anni chunga chun a var chu a suok naw am a nih?
How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?,"Chuong a ni chun iengtin am mihriem chu Pathien hmaa chun mi dik ni thei a ta? Annawleh, nuhmei inei taphawt chu iengtin am inthieng ni thei a ta?"
"Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight:","Ngai ta, thla khawm khin varna a nei nawh a, Arasihai khawm khi a mithmua chun an inthieng nawh;"
"How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!","Mihriem, chawkchawnâl el chu, a vân thieng naw nâwk zuol awm de! Mihriem naupa, chawkchawnâl el ni chu!” tiin."
"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!,“Thilthawtheina nei naw mi chu i va ṭhangpui hlak de! Kut hrâtna nei naw chu i va sanhim hlak de!
"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!",Varna nei naw chu i hril var a; Hrietna indiktak chu huntâwk zetin i hrilfie a!
To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?,Chuong thuhai chu tuin am ân hriltir che a na? Nangmaa inthawka suok chu tu thlarau am a na?
They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.,"A thi tahai chu an inthin a, Tuihai le chutaka umhai hnuoia chun."
"Sheol is naked before God, And Abaddon hath no covering.","Ama hmaa chun Seol chu saruok a nih, Sietna khawm chun silfên a nei nawh."
"He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.","Hmun ruok chunga chun hmârtieng chu a keiphar a, Leihnuoi chu iengkhawm nilo chungah a khai bawk a,"
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.,"Tuihai chu a sûm sâtakhai chun a fûn khâwm a, An hnuoia chun sûm chu ân ek si nawh a."
"He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it.","A lalṭhungpha hmai chu ân khum a, A chunga chun a sûm chu ân zâmtir a."
"He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.","Tuihai chunga chun ramri a riruong a, Sûn le zân tâwp chinhaia le chun."
The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke.,"Vân banhai chu an inthinin, A kâwknaa chun mak an tih a."
"He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.","A thilthawtheinain tuisuoriet chu a sukreh a, A hrietthiemna chun Rahab chu a sukthlûk bawk a;"
By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.,A thuok chun vânhai chu cheimawiin a um a; A kut chun rûlpui intawl lai chu a sunthleng tah a.
"Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?","En ta u, hi hi hman hi a lampuihai a ṭhen chau chu a na, A chanchin chu ei va hriet tlâwm lâwm lâwm ngei de! Nisienlakhawm, a thilthawtheina rihâu chu tuin am hrethiem thei a ta?” tiin."
"And Job again took up his parable, and said,","Chun, Job chun a thuhril chu a zawm nâwk a, a hril tah a."
"As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul","“Pathien, ka thiemna thu la hmangtu, Iengkimthawthei, ka lungril sukrimsitu chu a hring zing angin,"
"(For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);","Ka hringna chu keimaa a um sûng phawt le, Pathien thuok chu ka hnarkuohaia a um sûng phawt chun,"
"Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.","Ka hmûrhai chun fel nawna thu hril dêr naw nih a, Ka lei hin hlêmna thu sâksuok bawk naw ni."
Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.,Nangni thiem kân changtir ding cheu hi Pathien chun a khap a nih; Ka thi hmakhat chun ka lungril tluongna hi keimaa inthawkin sie hmang naw ning.
"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.","Ka felna chu dêttakin ka chel a, inthla naw ning, Ka dam sûngin ka lungril chun mi sawisêl bawk naw nih."
"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.","Ka hmêlma chu mi rilo ang hung ni sienla, Keima chunga kaltu chu mi fello ang hung ni raw se."
"For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?","Pathien ngaisak naw mi chun hlâwkna insiem fâwm hlak sien khawm, Pathienin a thlarau a lâkpêk pha chun ieng am beisei ding a nei leh?"
"Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?","Pathien chun a khêkri chu a ngai ding am a ni, A chunga buoina a hung tlung pha chun?"
"Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?","Iengkimthawtheia chun ama chu lungawiin, Pathien chu ieng lai khawmin a ko ding am a nih?"
I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.,"Pathien kut chungthua hin inchûktir ka ti cheu, Iengkimthawthei thiltum chu ip naw ningah."
"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?","Ngai ta u, in rêngin in hmu seng tah a; Anleh, iengdinga teplo mei mei in ni vawng el am a na?"
"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:","“Hi hi Pathiena mi rilo chan chu a nih; Nêksâwrtuhai rochan, Iengkimthawtheia inthawka an hmu chu."
"If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.","A thlahai an hung pung chun, kâwlhnâm ta ding el an nih; A chithlahai chun khawp tâwk bu nei naw ni hai."
"Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.","Ama hnunga la damhai chu thinaa phûm ning an ta, A nuhmei thisanhai (hmeithaihai) khawm chun sûnna siem naw ni hai."
"Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;","Tangka chu pilvut ang elin siekhâwl sien khawm, Silfên chu pilpawk ang elin siem sien khawm;"
"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.","Buotsai chu buotsai thei a tih, amiruokchu, mi fel chun sil a tih, A tangka khawm chu mi pawitâwk lo chun semdar bawk a tih."
"He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh.",A in chu aium angin a bâwl a. Vêngtuin a sâwlbûk a bâwl ang elin.
"He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers; He openeth his eyes, and he is not.","Mi hausa zâlin a zâl a, amiruokchu, chuong chu ni sawng naw ni, A mithai a hang meng a, a hausakna chu a um ta nawh a."
Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.,"Tuilien ang elin ṭitnahai chun ama a lâk hmang tah a, Zân kâr chun thlipui chun ama ân rûk hmang tah a."
"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.","Sak thli chun ama chu a lên hmang a, a fe hmang tah a; A hmuna inthawk chun a mût hmang tah a."
"For God shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.","Pathien chun ama chu pei thlâng a ta, hla naw ni, A kuta inthawkin thinthla hmang a tih."
"Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.","Mihai chun ama chu kut benkhum an ta, A hmuna inthawk chun ama chu hnawt dawk an tih."
"Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine.","“Tangkaruo ta ding chun cho- suokna hmun chu a um ngei a nih, Rângkachak ta dinga sukthiengna hmun leh."
"Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone.","Thîr chu leihnuoia inthawka lâk suok a na, Dârsen ruok chu lunga inthawka emtuia lâk suok a nih."
"Man setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.","Mihriemin inthimna a suktâwp a, Thina hlim le inthimna lung sâmuphai chu, A hmun hlatakahai chun a zawng suok hlak."
"He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.","A ram hluotuhai um nawnaa chun khur an cho a, A chunga fehai chun an theinghil a; Mi hlatnaah an inkhai a, an inthên an inthên a."
"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.","Hnuoi ruok chu amaa inthawk chun bei a hung suok a, A hnuoitieng chu, inlet chun chu mei ang el a nih."
"The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold.","Chutaka lunghai chu Sapphir lung hmun dâm a na, Rângkachak hlawmhai chu a um a nih."
"That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it:","Chu lampui chu chunglêng vate sa fami chun a hriet nawh a, Mulukawlhai mit khawm chun a hmu ngai nawh."
"The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.","Ramsa chapotakhai khawm chun an sir ngai nawh a, Sakeibaknei ṭiumtak khawm chun a hraw ngai nawh."
He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots.,"“A kut chu lungpui changtak chunga chun a sie suok a, Tlânghai chu a bula inthawkin a kei let a."
He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing.,"Lungpuihai lai chun tuiluongnahai a cho a, A mithai chun thil hlutak chu a hmuh a."
He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.,"An far nawna dingin tuihnârhai chu a ting a, Thil inthupa um chu varah a hung lâk suok tah a."
But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?,"Amiruokchu, khâwlai am varna chu hmu nîng a ta? Hrietthiemna hmun khawm chu khâwlai am a na?"
Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living.,"Mihriem chun chu man chu an hriet nawh a, Mi hring rama khawm chu chu hmu suok a ni bawk nawh."
"The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me.","Khursûng chun, ‘Keimaah a um nawh,’ a ta, Tuisuoriet chun, ‘Keimaah a um nawh,’ a ti bawk a."
"It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.","Rângkachaka nei thei a ni nawh a, Chu chu man ding chun tangkaruo khawm bûk thei a ni bawk nawh."
"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.","Ophir rângkachak le chun ngaihlut inang thei a ni nawh a, Sapphir amanih, Berul lung hlutak le khawm chun hlut inanga ngai thei a ni nawh."
"Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.","Rângkachak le hlimen chun an tluk thei nawh a, Chu chu thlengpui ding chu rângkachak inthiengtaka thleng thei khawm a ni bawk nawh."
"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.","Tuikeplung amanih, lunghlu khawm chu a hrila hril ding a ni nawh a, Anih, Varna man chu lunghlu chun tluk naw nih a,"
"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.","Ethiopia rama Topaz lunghlu chun tluk naw nih a, Rângkachak inthieng le khawm chun a hlut angkhata ngai ding a ni nawh."
Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?,"Anleh, varna chu khâwtaka inthawka hung am a na? Hrietthiemna hmun chu khâwlai am ni tâng a ta?"
"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.","Mi hring po po mithmuhaia inthawka thupa umin, Chunga vatehai kâwla khawm thup a nih."
"Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.","Bohmangna le Thina chun, ‘Chu chu thuthang chu kan nahaiin kan lo hriet a,’ an ta."
"God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof.","“Pathien chun chu lampui chu a hriet a, Chu chu hmun khawm chu a hriet a nih."
"For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;","Ama chun kâwlkawdawnghai chu a hmuh a, Vân khuphnuoi po po hi a hmu vawng a nih."
"To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.","Thli hrâtnahai chu a pêk lai khan, Anih, tuihai chu inkhinain ân khi suok a nih."
"When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;","Chu lai chun ruo ta ding chun bi a ruotpêkin, Vâninrûm, kâwlinlep ta ding khawma lampui a siempêk bawk a."
"Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out.","Chun, ama chun a hmuh a, a puong tah a, A tungding a, anih, a zawng suok bawk a."
"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.","Chun, mihriem kuoma chun, ‘Ngai ta, Lalpa ṭi chu, varna a nih; Suola inthawka fe hmang chu hrietthiemna a ni bawk a,’ a ta,” tiin"
"And Job again took up his parable, and said,","Chun, Job chun a thuhril chu a zawm nâwk a, a hril tah a:"
"Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;","“Aw thla hlui tahaia ang khan um la ni lang chu aw, Pathienin a mi vêng lai nihai anga khan;"
"When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;","A khâwnvar ka lu chungah a var lai, A var ringa inthimna ka fe thleng lai khan;"
"As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;","Ka vânglai nihaia ka um anga, Pathien thurâwn chu ka puon in chunga a um lai khan;"
"When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;","Iengkimthawthei chu ka kuomah a um a, Ka nauhai khawm ka sirah an um lai khan;"
"When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!","Ka kaiṭênhai chu nênetui khala sâwp a nih a, Lungpui chun hriek vadunghai chu a min suopêk hlak lai khan!"
"When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,","“Khawpui dai kawtkhâra ka va fe suok a, Kawtthlêra chun ṭhunghmun ka rem chun,"
"The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;","Tlangvâlhai chun an mi hmuh a, an inbi a, Upahai khawm chu an tho a, an ngîr hlak a,"
"The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;","Lalnauhai khawm chun an inbiek an mah a, An kuthai chun an bau chu an hup a;"
"The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.","Mi ṭhahai râwlhai khawm chu a hung reh a, An leihai chu an dang chungah a kawp tah a."
"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:","Nain a mi hriet chun, mal a mi sâwm hlak sih a, Mit khawma a mi hmu chun, ka kuomah hrietpuina a pêk a;"
"Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.","Mi rimsi khêk chu ka sansuokin, Fahra ama ṭhangpuitu ding neilo khawm chu ka sansuok hlak leiin,"
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.,"A malsâwmna bohmang ṭêp khawm chu ka kuomah a hungin, Hmeithai lungril chu hlima hlasak dingin kân umtir hlak."
"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.","Felna chu ka sil a, chu chun a mi thuom a, Ka felna chu lalpuon le lukâwm ang a nih."
"I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.","Mitdel ta dingin mithai ka na, Kebâi ta dingin kehai ka nih."
I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.,"Tlasam ta dingin pa ka na, Chun, a chungthu ka hriet naw khawm chu ka zawng suok hlak."
"And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.","Mi fello ha chu ka sukthliek a, A sa fâk chu a haa inthawk chun ka lâk suok hlak."
"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:","Chun, ‘Ka bua chun thîng ka ta, Ka nihai chu phaiphin zâtin sukpung ka tih,’ ka tih a."
"My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch:","Ka zung chu tuihai chenin ân zâm a, Ka zâr chunga chun zânkhawvârin dâidaw chu a kûr bawk a."
"My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.","Ka ropuina chu keimaa chun a thar a, Ka kuta chun ka thalngul chu siemtharin a um bawk a."
"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.","“Ka kuomah miin na an sit a, an nghâk a, Ka thurâwn chu ngaiin an to hlak."
After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.,"Ka thu hnungahai chun thu an hril nâwk ta ngai nawh a, Ka ṭawng chu an chungah a tla a."
And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.,"Ruo nghâk angin kei an mi nghâk a, Ruo nuhnung tieng nghâk angin an bau an ka lien a."
"I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.","Anni kân nuipui a, an inring naw laiin, Ka hmêlput hlimum chu an pei thlâk chuong nawh a."
"I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.","An lampui ka thlang suok a, lal angin ka ṭhung a, Sipai laia lal tak angin ka khawsa a, Mi thlavaihai thlamuongtu ang elin."
"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.","Chu hnunga chun Job chun a bau a kah a, a pieng ni chu ṭawngsie ân phur tah a."
And Job answered and said:,"Chun, Job chun a hril tah a:"
"Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.","“Ni, ka piengna ni chu bohmang sienla, ‘Naupasal pâi a nih ie,’ titu zân le chun."
"Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.","Chu ni chu sukthimin um sienla, Chungtienga inthawkin Pathien khawmin ngaisak naw sienla; A chungah var khawm var bawk naw raw se."
Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.,"Inthimna le thina hlim chun anni ta ngeiah hau sienla, A chungah sûm zîng tlat raw se; Ni inthimna chun suklâu raw hai se."
"As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.","Chu zân chu inthim sâmupin man sienla, Chu kum sûng nihaia chun hlimna hrim hrim um naw sienla; Thla nizât tiemnaa khawm ṭhang ve naw raw se."
"Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.","Anih, chu zân chu zân dawkdâium ni sienla, Chu zâna chun hlim râwl hrim hrim um naw raw se."
"Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.","Ni ṭawngsie inphurtuhai chun ṭawngsie inphur raw se, Leviathan sukhar dân thiemhai chun."
"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:","A sîkhawvar chu inthim sienla, Var zawng sienla, hmu bawk naw sienla; Zîngkâr khawfingchat khawm hmu bawk naw raw se."
"Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.","Ka nu sula kawtkhârhai chu a lo khâr nawh a, Ka mithaia inthawkin buoina chu a thup naw bawk leiin."
Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?,Sula chun iengdinga ka lo thi naw am a na? Phîng sûnga inthawka ka hung suokin iengdinga thlarau chu lo inthla el naw am ka na?
"Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?",Khûphai chun iengdinga an mi lo dawm am a na? Nênehai chun ka nêk ding elin iengdinga an mi lo pawm am a na?
"For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,","Tuhin zâlin to riem riem tâng ka ta, In ka ta, sâwldamin ka um ta ding bah:"
"With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;","Hi hnuoia lalhai le rorêltuhai, Anni ta dinga hmun sehai siemtuhai le chun;"
"Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:","Annawleh, lal nau rângkachak neituhai, An inhai tangkaruoa suksiptuhai le chun."
"Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.","Annawleh, pieng hun loa thupa um ang ka ni ta ding, Nautê, var hrim hrim hmu ngailohai ang hi."
There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.,"Chutaka chun mi rilo chun a sukbuoina chu ma tâng a ta, Chutaka chun rimsi chu sâwldam tâng a tih."
There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.,Chutaka chun lung in intânghai chu um khâwm dingin an zalên a; Sin inthâwtirtu râwlri khawm an hriet ta ngai nawh.
The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.,Mi lien le mi chîn khawm chutaka chun an um khâwm a; Siehlaw khawm chu a hotua inthawk inthla a ni tah.
"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;","Iengdinga mi, rimsitaka um kuoma chun var pêk a nih a, Lungrila rimsi tuor kuoma chun hringna pêk am a nih a?"
"Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;","Thi inhâwk êm êma thi thei si lo a, Ro phûm zawng nêk hmana zawng nasa a,"
"Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?","Thlân chu a hmu suok thei pha a, Nasataka hlim êm êm ding kuoma chun?"
"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?","Iengdinga mi, a lampui thupa um kuoma le, Pathienin paldâi ân huonkhum kuoma chun var pêk am a na?"
"For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.","Ka bufâk hmain ka thuokdawngna chu a hung tlung a, Kân rûmnahai chu tui anga bunthlâk an ni hlak sih a."
"For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.","Thil ka iṭi tak chu ka chungah a hung tlung hlak a, Ka înlâu tak chu ka kuomah a hung tlung hlak."
"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.","Inhawiin ka um nawh a, ka to ṭawk ṭawk thei nawh a, Sâwldam ka nei bawk nawh a; buoina a hung tlung lem hlak,” tiin."
"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.","“Nisienlakhawm, tuhin ka nêka naupang lemhai khawm chun nuizabûrah an mi nei a; An pahai ka ran ruol uihai vêng dinga ka nuiêuhai khan,"
"Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.","Anih, an kut thahrâthai chun a ieng chun am mi sukhlâwk a ta? Mi an vânglai hun fe liem ta hi."
"They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.","Tlâksamna le ṭâmna leiin an inrieng a, Râusanna le sietna hmun thim thlalêr ram chu an tlân a."
They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food.,"Hna rimtui hnabuk le, Luong zunghai chu an bu dingin an lâk a."
They are driven forth from the midst of men; They cry after them as after a thief;,"Mihriem laia inthawka hnawt hmangin an um a, Inru rau ang elin an hnunga chun an rau a."
"So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.","Ruom chadan kârahai le, Hnuoi kuoahai le lungpui pûkahai um dingin."
Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.,"Hlobuk lai chun an khêk a, Zakthlai buk hnuoia chun an um khâwm a."
"They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scourged out of the land.","Invêt nauhai an nih, anih, mi hmangnabohai nauhai an na; Rama inthawk hnawt suok an nih."
"And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.","“Tuhin annihai hla chu ka lo ni ta hi; Anih, anni ta dingin ṭawngnaa hmang ka lo ni tah."
"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face.","An mi pâwlser a, keimaa inthawka hlatakah an ngîr a, Ka hmaia chil mi sâk khum khawm an ma nawh."
"For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.","Ka thalhrui chu a sût a, a mi sukrinum ta leiin, Ka hmaa chun thîrse chu an pei thlâk a."
"Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.",Ka changtieng panga chun mi dukdaklo chu a tho a. Ka kehai chu ân tâwlhmang a; Ka chunga chun an bohmangna lampuihai chu an inchuon tah a.
"They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, Even men that have no helper.","Ka lampui chu nasatakin an suksiet a, Ka lungngaina chu hma an insâwntir a, Anni chu tukhawmin an khap nawh."
As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.,"Tui inṭhe huk ang elin an hung a, Suksietna laia chun keia chungah an intêl a."
Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.,"Ṭitnahai chu ka chungah a hung tlung a, Ka miṭhatna chu thli ang elin an hnawt a, Ka vângneina hlak chu sûm angin a fe liem tah a."
And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.,Tuhin ka lungril chu keia sûnga hin bunthlâkin a um a; Rimsikna nihai chu ka chungah a tlung chie ta a ni hi.
"In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.","Zân huna chun ka ruhai hin an mi chip an mi chip a, Chuong natna mi chip mi chiphai chu an ma ngai nawh."
By God’s great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.,"Ka natna hrâtna nasatak lei chun ka silfên chu a hmêlhem zo a, Ka zakaw rîng angin a mi khuop ta lem a."
"He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.","Dûmchirhaka chun a mi the lût a, Vut le pilvut ang el ka ni tah a ni hi."
"I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me.","I kuomah ka hung khêk a, nang hlaka i mi dawn nawh a, Ka ngîr a, nangin i mi en nawh a."
Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.,"Ka chunga nunse dingin în chang tah a, I kut hrâtna chun i mi hrem a ni ta hi."
"Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; And thou dissolvest me in the storm.","Nang chun thlia chun i mi dawmkâng a, a chunga chun i mîn chuongtir a, Thlipuia chun i mi suktui tah a."
"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.","Nang chun thina le, Mi hring po po ta dinga in ruota chun mi ṭhuoi i tih ti ka hriet sih a."
Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?,"“Sietna nasatak tuortu chun a kut phar suokin, A sietna chunga chun ṭhangpuina ngaiin a khêk naw ding am a nih?"
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?,Mi buoina tâwk ta ding chun ka ṭap hlak a ni naw am a nih? Mi tlasam ta ding khawm chun ka lungril ân rim hlak a ni naw am a nih?
"When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.","Thil ṭha ka zawng laiin, thil ṭha naw a hung tlung a; Var ka nghâk zing laiin, inthimna a hung tlung bawk a."
"My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me.","Ka lung ân phu hlawp hlawp a, a châwl nawh a; Rimsikna nihai chu ka chungah a hung tlung a ni ta hi."
"I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.","Nisa ni si loa em dukin ka um a; Inkhâwmna lai chun ka ngîr dawk a, ṭhangpuina ngaiin ka khêk a."
"I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.","Sihalhai ta dinga unaupa ka lo na, Ostrikhai ta dinga ruolpa leh."
"My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones are burned with heat.","Ka vun chu a hung dum a, keimaa inthawkin ân khawk a; Ka ruhai chu lumin a kâng bawk a."
"Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.","Chuleiin, ka ṭingṭang chu sûnnaah ân chang a, Ka theihle chu mi ṭaphai râwlah ân chang bawk a."
I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a virgin?,"“Ka mit leh thuthlung ka siem a, Iengtin am nunghâk chu en tâng ka ta?"
"For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high?",Chungtienga Pathiena inthawka ka chan chu ieng am a na? Chungtienga Iengkimthawtheia inthawka ka rochan chu ieng am a ni leh?
"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity?","Mi fello ta dingin vângduoina, Rîtlona thawtuhai ta dingin sietna a ni naw am a nih?"
"Doth not he see my ways, And number all my steps?","Ka lampuihai chu a hmuin, Ka kalchawihai chu a tiem vawng a ni naw am a nih?"
"If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot hath hasted to deceit","“Chapotaka kal ka chawi a, Ka ke chun hlêmna tieng a pên inhmaw chun;"
"(Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know mine integrity);","(Bûkna indiktaka bûkin mîn umtir sienla, Pathien chun ka ringumna chu a hriet theina dingin)"
"If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:","Ka kalchawi chun lampui a pêtsan a, Ka lungrilin ka mithai chu a zui bawk chun, Ka kuthaiah kaidum hrim a um phawt chun;"
"Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.","Mîn tûtir la, mi dangin fa raw hai se; Anih, ka lo rasuok chu a zunga kar hmangin um raw se."
"If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;","Ka lungril hin nuhmei tieng a ngaisak chun, Ka tuolbâwm kawtkhâr bula kân chân bawk chun;"
"Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her.","Ka nuhmei hin mi dang kuomah bu râwt sienla, Mi dang chu a chungah bawk raw se."
"For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:","Chu chu thuse theidaumtak a ni sih a, Anih, rorêltuin a hrem ding khawpa rîtlona a nih."
"For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, And would root out all mine increase.",Bohmangna dinga kâng hmangtu mei chu a ni sih a; Chu chun ka hlâwkna po po chu karphawi vawng a tih.
"If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me;","Ka siehlawpa amanih, ka siehlawnu amani chungthu ka ngaitha chun, Kei le kan insukbuoi laiin,"
"What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?",Pathien chu hung tho ta sienla ieng am lâwng ka ta? A hung indawn fel pha chun iengin am ama dawn ka ta?
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?,Sula kei mi siemtu chun ama khawm chu a siem a ni naw am a nih? Sula chun ama chun a mi siemvêl ve ve ni lo am a nih?
"If I have withheld the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,","“Mi rimsi chu an dit zâwng kân ropêk chun, Annawleh, hmeithai mithai chu hlawsam dinga ka siem chun;"
"Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof","Annawleh, ka fâk ding chu ka khâta ka fâk a, Fahra chun chutaka mi chu a fâk ve naw chun;"
"(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her have I guided from my mother’s womb);","(Ni lo, ka tleirâwla inthawk tah pa kuoma angin ka kuoma inṭhanglien a na, Ka nu sula inthawka kei chu amanu ṭhuoitu chu ka lo ni ta si chun);"
"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;","Silfên tlasama mi bohmang hrim hrim ka hmu chun, Annawleh, chu tlasam chun silfên a nei hlek naw chun;"
"If his loins have not blessed me, And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;","A kâwng chun mal a mi lo sâwm ta nawh a, Ka berâmhai hmula ama chu suklum a lo ni ngai naw chun;"
"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate:","Dâikawtkhâra chun ka ṭhangpuina chu ka hmu leia, Fahrahai chu kalin an chungah kut ka lo inlet ta chun;"
"Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone.","Ka liengko hi darphêka inthawkin tla hlawl sienla, Ka bân hi a ruchânga inthawkin tliek raw se."
"For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.","Pathiena inthawka sietna chu ka ṭi lei le, A ropuina ṭina leiin chuong thilhai chu ka thaw thei naw a nih."
"If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;","Ka beiseina chu rângkachaka ka siem chun, Rângkachak inthieng kuoma chun, ‘Nang hi ka ringsan tak chu i nih,’ ka ti chun;"
"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much;","Ka hausakna hi a hung nasat lei a ka hlim a, Ka kut chun tamtak a hung hmu leia ka lâwm a ni chun,"
"If I have beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness,","Nisa chu vartaka a var lei le, Thla chu vartaka a fê lai ka thlîr a;"
"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand:","Ka lungril chu inrûka hîpa a um a, Ka bau chun ka kut chu a fâwp chun;"
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above.,Hi khawm hi rîtlona rorêltuin a hrem ding chu a nih: Chunga um Pathien chu ka hlêm a ni ding an sih a.
"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him","“Keia mi theidatu sietnaa chun ka hlim a, Annawleh, ama chu thil ṭha nawin a hmu suok phaa kân sie chung chun;"
"(Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse);","(A hringna ta dinga ṭawngsie inphura, Suksuol dingin ka bau chu ka phal nawh)"
"If the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?","Ka puon ina mihai chun, ‘A tisa saw ei nei naw chun khawp tâwk nâwm ei ni,’ an ti naw chun,"
(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller);,"(Mikhuol chu kawtthlêra chun a riek nawh a; Amiruokchu, mikhuol ta ding chun ka kawtkhâr chu ka hawng lem hlak)."
"If like Adam I have covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,","Mihai anga ka bawsietnahai chu ka ip a, Ka ângsûnga ka rîtlona chu thupa kân khum chun;"
"Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door—","Mipui nasatakhai chu ka ṭih a, Sûngkaw inpâwina chun a mi suklâu bawk a; Ka to ṭawk a, kawtkhâr khawm ka suok ngam naw a ni chun,"
"Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me) And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!","Aw ka thu mi ngaipêk ding hi chu um hai sien! (En ta u, hitaka hin ka hming ziek a um a, Iengkimthawthei chun mi dawn raw se;) Ka hmêlmain a ziek, hêkna lekhabu chu nei lang chu aw!"
Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown:,"Matheiloin ka liengkoah put ka ta, Lukhum angin keimaa chun khitde ngei ngei ka tih;"
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him.,Ka kalchawi ni zât chu ama kuomah hrilfieng ka ta; Lal nau angin ama hnaiah fêng ka tih.
"If my land crieth out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together;","Ka ram chu ka chungah a khêk a, A changkuonghai chu an ṭap a;"
"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:","Chutaka rahai chu tangka boa ka fâk chun: Annawleh, a neituhai chu chutaka chun an hringna inhmang khawpa a siem chun;"
"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.","Bu nêkin hlingbuk ṭo lem sienla, buṭei nêkin buor ṭo lem raw se,” tiin. Job thuhrilhai chu a tâwp tah."
"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.","Chuongchun, hi mi pathum hai hin Job an dawnna chu an tâwp tah a, ama mithmua chun a fel tlat si leiin."
"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.","Ram hnama mi Buz mi Barakel naupa Elihu lung chu a sen tah a; a lunginsenna chu Job chungah a nih a hung sat chu, ama le ama chu Pathien nêka thiem ân changtir tlat leiin."
"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.","A ruolhai pathum chunga khawm a lunginsenna chu a hung sa bawk a, dawnna ding hmu suok si loin, Job chu thiemnaw an inchangtir si leiin."
"Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.","Tuhin Elihu chun Job kuoma thuhril ding chu a nghâk a, ama nêka anni chu an upa lem leiin."
"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.","Chun, Elihu chun chuong mi pathum hai baua inthawk chun dawnna hrim a um naw ti a hmu chun a lunginsenna chu a hung zuol tah a."
"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.","Chun, Elihu Buz mi Barakel naupa chun a dawn a, a hril tah a: “Kei naupang ka na, nangni chu upatak in na; Chuleiin, kân sûm a, ka ngaidân chu in kuomah kân entir ngam naw cheu a nih."
"I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.","‘Nihai chun hung hril a ta, Kumhai tamna chun varna inchûktir naw nîm,’ ka lo ta."
"But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.","Amiruokchu, mihriema chun thlarau a um a, Iengkimthawthei chun a thuokin anni chu hrietthiemna a pêk a ni lem a."
"It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice.","Mi ropuihai chu an var chuong kher nawh a, Mi upahai chun thudik chu an hrietthiem vawng kher bîk nawh."
"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion.","Chuleiin, ‘Kei mi ngai unla, Kei khawma ka ngaidân inhriettir ka tih’, ka ti a nih."
"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say.","“Ngai ta u, in thuhai chu ka nghâk zing a, In thuhril sanhai ka lo ngai zing a, Ieng am hril ding tia in zawng sûng po khan."
"Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you.","Anih, in kuomah ka um zing a. Chun, ngai ta u, nangni lai tukhawm Job thuhne hrim hrim in um dêr nawh a. Annawleh, nangni lai a thuhai dawn thei hrim in um dêr naw a nih."
"Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:","‘Varna kan hmu suok tah, Mihriem ni loin, Pathien chun a namhnuoi a nih’, ti hlau rawi in tih."
For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.,"A thuhai chu keima kal zâwngin ân kâwltir nawh a, In thuhrilhai angin kei khawmin ama chu dawn bawk naw ning."
"They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say.","Anni chun mak an ti tah a, an dawn ta hrim hrim nawh a, Thu bau khat khawm hril ding hrim an nei ta nawh a."
"And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?","Thu an hril ta naw leiin, An ngîr ṭawk ṭawk a, an dawn ta hrim hrim naw leiin, ka nghâk ding maw?"
"I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion.","Kei khawma ka chana chun dawn vêng ka ta, Kei khawma ka ngaidân chu inentir vêng ka tih."
For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.,Thuhaiin ka sip sih a; Ka sûnga thlarau hin a mi tirlui a nih.
"Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.","Ngai ta u, ka sûng chu uoin hu suokna nei lo ang chu a nih; Peng tharhai puokkawi ṭêp ding ang chu."
"I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.","Ka sâwl a dam huoina dingin thu hril ka ta, Ka bau kain dawn ka tih."
"Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.","Ka hni cheu hi, mi tukhawm mi nina chu mîn zâtir naw unla, Mi tukhawm kuomah hming ṭha tehlêm chu pe bawk naw ning."
For I know not to give flattering titles; Else would my Maker soon take me away.,"Inpâk tehlêm chu ka thiem si nawh a, Chuong naw chun, kei mi Siemtu hin mi la hmang vak rawi a tih."
"Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.","“Chuleiin, Job, ka ngên che hi, ka thuhril hi lo ngai la, Ka thuhai po po khawm lo ngai vawng ta."
"Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.","Tuhin ngai ta, ka bau chu ka kah a, Ka bau sûnga chun ka leiin thu a hril ta hi."
My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.,Ka thuhai chun ka lungril tluongziehai chu hril suok a tih; Ka hmûrhaiin an thil hriet chu takinningtakin hril bawk an tih.
"The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.","Pathien Thlarau chun a mi siem a, Iengkimthawthei thuok chun hringna a mi pêk a."
"If thou canst, answer thou me; Set thy words in order before me, stand forth.","I thei chun chu kei mi dawn la, Ka hmaa hin i thuhai chu ân dawtin hung suklangin târ suok rawh."
"Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay.","Ngai ta, nangma ang bawkin kei khawm Pathien tienga ṭhang ka na, Kei khawm pilpawka inthawka siem ka nih."
"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.","Ngai ta, ka ṭitumna chun nang suklâu naw ni cheh a, I chungah ka hnengna che hi rik talaw bawk naw nih."
"Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,","“Matheiloin ka hrieta khawm i hril a, I thuhai ri chu hienga hrilin ka lo hriet ta bawk a,"
"I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:","‘Bawsietna nei loin kân thieng a nih, Pawitâwklo ka na, keimaa hin rîtlona hrim a um bawk nawh,"
"Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy;","Ngai ta, ka chungah remchâng hun hmuin, A hmêlmaah a mi ruot tah a."
"He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.","Ka kehai chu kawl a mîn bun a, Ka lampuihai po po chu ân chik tlat bawk a,’ i tih a."
"Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man.","Ngai ta, dawn ka ti che, hitaka hin în dik naw a nih; Pathien chu mihriem nêkin a ropui lem sih a."
"Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?",Ama chunga chun iengdinga i hel am a na? Mihriem thu iengkhawm a dawn nawh tiin.
"For God speaketh once, Yea twice, though man regardeth it not.","Pathien chun vawi khat thu a hril a, Anih, vawi hni khawm, miin ngaisak naw hai sien khawm."
"In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;","Mangah, zâna mitthlaa thilhmua, Îmu indêntakin mihai chu a hung zêl phah a, Khum chunga îmu inhniktaka a in lai chun a hril a."
"Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction,","Mihai nahai chu a hawngpêk a, Zillâwknahai chun anni a sukṭi hlak."
"That he may withdraw man from his purpose, And hide pride from man;","Mihriem chu a thiltuma inthawka a lâk hmang theina ding le, Mihriema inthawka chapona chu a thup theina dingin;"
"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.","A thla chu khursûnga inthawka a lâk kîr theina dingin le, A hringna chu kâwlhnâma bohmangnaa inthawka a lâkkîr theina dingin."
"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;","“A khum chunga chun natna khawma thunun a na, A ruhaia naa chip zingna leh."
"So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food.","Chuongchun, a hringna chun bei chu a theida a, A lungril chun sa a ten a."
"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.","A taksa chu kâng hmangin a um a, hmu thei a ni nâwk ta naw a; A ruhai hmu thei lohai khawm chu a hung dâwk a."
"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.","Anih, a thlarau chun khursûng chu a hnai a; A hringna chun suksetuhai chu a hnai bawk a."
"If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him;","A kuoma chun vântirko um sienla, Palai, sâng khat laia pakhat chu, Mihriem kâwla ama ta dinga ân dik chu inentir dingin;"
"Then God is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.","Ama chun a chunga chun zângaiin, ‘Khur sûnga fenaa inthawkin ama chu sanhim ro, Intlanna ka hmu suok tah a."
His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; He returneth to the days of his youth.,"A tisa chu naupang tisa nêkin tharlâm lem sien, A tleirâwl lai nihaiah kîr nâwk raw se’ ti sienla,"
"He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.","Pathien kuoma chun ṭawngṭai sienla, ama chun lo dawn a tih, Chuongchun, a hmêl chu hlimin um a tih, Mi kuoma chun a felna chu a pêk kîr nâwk ding leiin."
"He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:","Mihai hmaa chun hla sak tâng a ta; ‘Ka lo suksuol tah a, ân dik chu ka lo fe hmangsan tah a, Anachu a mi hung thung kher nawh a:"
"He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light.","Khursûng a fenaa inthawkin ka thlarau chu a sanhim a, Ka hringna chun var chu hmûng a tih,’ tiin."
"Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,","“En ta, hieng po po hi Pathien chun a thawh a, Vawi hni, anih, vawi thum, mihriema chun a thaw a nih."
"To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.","Khursûnga inthawka a thlarau chu hung ṭhuoi kîr ding le, Hringna vara chun ama chu sunvar a ni theina dingin."
"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak.","Inchik ṭha ta, aw Job, kei mi ngai ta, Lo to ṭawk ṭawk la, thu hril ka tih."
"If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee.","Iengkhawm hril ding i nei chun mi hung dawn la, Thu hril ta, nang chu thiem inchangtir che ka nuom sih a,"
"If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.","Chuong a ni naw leh, kei mi ngai la, Lo to ṭawk ṭawk la, varna inchûktir ka ti che,” tiin."
"Moreover Elihu answered and said,","Chun, Elihu chun a hril a:"
"Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.","“Nangni mi varhai, ka thuhai hi lo ngai ta u; Nangni hrietna neituhai, keia tieng in na lo sit ta u."
"For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.","Dangin fâk ding ân tem ang bawkin, Na chun thuhai chu a fie hlak sih a."
Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.,Ân dik taphawt chu eini ta dingin thlang ei ta. A ṭha chu eini lai hre bawk ei tiu khai.
"For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:","Job chun, ‘Kei chu ka fel a nih, Pathien chun ka thiemna chu a lâk hmang tah a."
"Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.","Ka thiemna chunga chun kân khêl ding am a nih? Bawsietna bo ni lang khawm, ka hliemna chu sukdam thei lo a nih,’ a ti sih a."
"What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,","Job ang hi mi tu am an um a, Hmusitna tui ang ela dâwn a,"
"Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?","Rîtlona thawtuhai le hmunkhata feh a, Mi rilohai le intlawn hlak chu?"
"For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.","Ama chun, ‘Mihriem ta dingin ieng khawm a ṭhahnem nawh,’ ti siin, Pathiena chun ama chu a lâwm chu."
"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.","Chuleiin, nangni hrietthiemna neihai, mi lo ngai ta u, Rîtlona thâwng a tih ti hi Pathiena inthawka hlatak a ni ding a na, Suolna thâwng a tih ti hi, Iengkimthawtheia inthawka hlatak a ni ding a nih."
"For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.","Mi chu a sinthaw ang peiin ama kuomah a pêk ding a na, A lampuihai ang peiin mi tin chu ân hmutir ding a ni hi."
"Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.","Anih, matheiloin, Pathien chun rilotakin thaw naw tawp a ta, Iengkimthawthei chun rorêlna chu sukdanglam bawk naw ni."
Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?,"Hnuoi chunga enkawl dingin tuin am thu a pêk a? Annawleh, khawvêl pumpui hi tuin am a chungah ân nghat leh?"
"If he set his heart upon himself, If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;","Ama le ama chunga chun a lung inkîr lêt sienla, Ân thuokna le a thlarau chu ama kuoma chun la khâwm sienla chu;"
"All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.","Tisa po po chu bohmang vawng an ta, Mihriem chu pilvuta bawk kîr nâwk el a tih."
"If now thou hast understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.","“Tuhin, hrietthiemna i nei chun chu, hi hi lo ngai la, Ka thuhai ri chu lo ngai raw khai."
Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?—,"Indikna theidatu chun ro a rêl ding am a nih? Mi indik le mi hrât chu i dem ding am a ni,"
"Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile, Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;","Lal kuomah, ‘I suol a nih’ tih a, Mi ṭhahai kuomah, ‘In rilo a nih’ titu;"
"That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.","Lalnauhai khawm inza biklo, Hausahai khawm mi rimsi nêka ngaisâng chuong lotu chu? An rêngin a kutsuokhai an ni sih a."
"In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.","Mitkhapkâr loin an thih a, zânrila ngei khawm; Mihai chu sukhnîngin an um a, an fe hmang tah a; Mi thilthawtheihai khawm chu kut ṭhangloa lâkin an um bawk a."
"For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.","A mithai chu mihriem lampuihai chunga chun a fuh a, A fe vêl po po khawm chu a hmu zing a."
"There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.","Thina hlim amanih, inthimna amanih khawm a um nawh, Thil khawhlo thawtuhai an inbîkna ding hmun chu."
"For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.","Mihriem chunga chun chantâwk bâk nêka nasa chu innghat naw nih a, Pathien hmaa chun rorêlnaah a fe ding a nih."
"He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.","Mi hrâthai chu a nawi tiem sêngloin suknawi a ta, An aiah mi danghai sie thung a tih."
"Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.","Chuleiin, an sinthawhai chu a hriet a, Zâna chun ân letling a, chuongchun, suksiet an ni tah a."
He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;,"Mi rilohai angin anni a vuok a, Mi danghai mithmua chun;"
"Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:",Ama chu zui dinga an pêthmangsan lei le A lampuihai chu pakhat khawm an ngaisak naw leiin.
"So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.","Chuongchun, mi rimsi khêk ri chu ama kuom an intlungtir a, Chun, ama chun sukrimsia um khêk ri chu a lo hriet a."
"When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:","To ṭawk ṭawka a um laiin, tuin am dem thei an ta? Chun, a hmai a thup lai chun tuin am ama chu hmu thei an ta? Hnam pumpui chunga thaw amanih mi pakhat chunga thaw amani khawm ni sien, angkhat a nih."
"That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.","Pathien ngaisak naw mi chun ro rêl naw sien chu, Mihai chu a âwk ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."
"For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:","Mi tukhawma Pathien kuomah an ti ta hlak am, ‘Thununna chu ka tuor tah a, suklungsen nâwk ta ngai dêr naw ning;"
"That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?","Ka hmu nawhai chu nangin mîn chûktir la, Suolna lo thaw tah ka ni chun, thaw ta ngai naw ning,’ tiin."
"Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.","A thungna chu i nuom angtak chu a ni ding maw, nang chun i kal vei a? Nang chun i thlang ding a nih, kei ni loin; Chuleiin, i hriet chu hril rawh."
"Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:","Mi, hrietthiemna nei mihai chun ka kuoma hieng hin tîng an ta, Anih, mi var tinhai kei mi lo ngai hlakhai chun;"
"Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.","‘Job chun hrietna nei loin thu a hril a. A thuhai chu varna bo a nih,’ tiin."
"Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.","Job chu a tâwp chena fie ni sienla aw, Mi rilohai anga a dawnna leiin."
"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.","A suolnaa chun helna chu a belsaa, Eini lai hin a kuthai a ben a, A thuhai chu Pathien chunga chun a sukpung tah a,” tiin."
"Moreover Elihu answered and said,","Chun, Elihu chun a hril a,"
"Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s,","“Hi hi indikin i ngaituo am a nih? Annawleh, ‘Ka felna chu Pathien felna nêkin a nasa lem,’ i ti am a nih?"
"That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?",‘I ta dingin ieng am a ṭhatna a um a? Ka suksuol naw hi ieng am ka hlâwkna a um a?’ i ti a nih.
"I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.","Nanga kuoma i ruolhai le, Nang ka hung dawn ding che a nih."
"Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.","Vânhai tieng khi ngha la, en ta; Sûmhai khi en ta, nanga nêkin an insâng lem a nih."
"If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?","Thil suol i lo thaw ta chun, ama chungah ieng am i thawh a? I bawsietnahai chu a hung pung chun, ieng am i thawpêk a?"
"If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?","I fel a ni chun, ama chu ieng am i pêk a? Annawleh, i kuta inthawkin ama chun ieng am a hmuh a?"
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.,"I rîtlona chun nangma ang bawkin mi a sukna thei a, Chun, i felna chun mihriem naupa chu a sukhlâwk thei a nih."
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.,"“Nêksâwrna tamtakhai lei chun an khêk a, Mi hrât bân leiin ṭhangpuina ngênin an khêk bawk a."
"But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,","Nisienlakhawm, tukhawma, ‘Kei a mi Siemtu Pathien chu khâwlai am a um a, Zâna khawm hlahai pe hlaktu chu?"
"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?","Ama hnuoia ramsahai nêka mîn chûktir nasa lem a, Chunglêng vatehai nêka var lema mi siemtu chu?’ an ti nawh."
"There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.","Chutaka chun an khêk a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin dawnna an pêk nawh, Mi suolhai chapona lei chun."
"Surely God will not hear an empty cry, Neither will the Almighty regard it.","Matheiloin, Pathien chun teplo mei mei chu ngai naw nih a, Iengkimthawthei chun ngaisak bawk naw ni."
"How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!","Nangin ama chu ka hmu nawh i ti lem hin chu a ni naw âwm nasa de! Rorêlna chu ama hmaa um a ni sih a, ama chu ring el rawh."
"But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;","Amiruokchu, tuhin, a lunginsennain a hung hrem nawh a, Chapona chu a ngaisak bawk nawh a;"
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.,"Chuleiin, Job hin teplo mei meiin a bau chu a kah a, Hrietna nei loin thuhai chu a sukpung a ni hi,” tiin."
"Elihu also proceeded, and said,","Elihu chun a zawm pei a, a hril a:"
"Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf.","“Mi lo daw hrâm la, inentir ka ti che; Pathien hmingin hril ding ṭhenkhat ka nei sih a."
"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.","Hlataka inthawkin ka hrietna hung lâng ka ta, Felna chu keia mi Siemtu kuomah inentir ka tih."
For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.,"Indiktakin, ka thuhai hi ân khêl si nawh a; Mi hrietna famkim nei chu i kuomah a um a nih."
"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.","Ngai ta, Pathien chu thilthawthei a na, tukhawm a hmusit ngai nawh a, Hrietna hrâtnaa thilthawthei a nih."
"He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right.","Mi rilo hringna chu a hla nawh a; Amiruokchu, sukrimsia umhai kuoma chun an thuneina chu a pêk a nih."
"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.","Mi fela inthawk chun a mithai a lâk kîr ngai nawh a, Amiruokchu, lalṭhungphaah lalhai leh an um a; Kumkhuoin anni chu a tungding a, chawimawi an ni hlak."
"And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of affliction;","Kawlhai inbuntira an um a, Sukrinumna hruihaia kei an ni chun;"
"Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.","An sinthaw le an bawsietnahai le, Chapotakin an lo khawsak tâkzie ân entir hlak."
"He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.","Inchûktirna tieng chun an na chu a sukvarpêk a, Suolnaa inthawka kîr dingin thu a pêk hlak."
"If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.","Chu chu an ngai a, ama rawng an bâwl chun, an nihai chu hausaknain hmang zo an ta, An kumhai chu nuomsipnain."
"But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.","Amiruokchu, an ngâi naw chun, kâwlhnâmin bohmang an ta, Hrietna boin thîng an tih."
But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.,"Nisienlakhawm, chuong lungrila Pathien ngaisak nawhai chun lunginsenna an khâwlkhâwm a, Anni a khuop pha khawm ṭhangpuina ngênin an khêk nawh."
"They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean.","Vânglaiin an thih a, An hringna chu mi dukdaklohai lai a bohmang tah a."
"He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.","Sukrimsia umhai chu a sukrimsiknain a sanhim a, Nêksâwrnain an nahai chu a sukvar tah a."
"Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.","Anih, rimsiknaa inthawk chun nang chu ṭhuoi hmang a ti cheh a, Inchêpna umlo, hmun lientaka chun; Chun, i dawkâna siea um chu thâunain sip tâng a tih."
But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee.,"Amiruokchu, nang chu mi rilo rorêla sip i ni tah a, Rorêlna le indikna chu nangmaa chun ân phun tah a nih."
For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.,"Lunginsenna a um leiin, indittâwkna chun ṭhuoi hmang hlau a che, fîmkhur rawh; Intlanna nasatak chun nang chu hnâwlhmang bâwk naw raw se che."
"Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength?","Rimsia i um nawna dingin i hausaknahai chu a huntâwk am a nih? Annawleh, i thahrui hrâtnahai po po chu a hun am a nih?"
"Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.","Zân chu dit naw la, Chu huna chun mihai chu an hmuna sât thlâk an ni hlak."
"Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.","Fîmkhur la, suolna chu ngaisak naw, Sukrimsia umna nêkin hi hi i thlang ta sih a."
"Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?","Ngai ta, Pathien chun a thilthawtheinain insângtakin a thawh a, Ama ang inchûktirtu tu am an um a?"
"Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?","Tuin am a lampui a ruotpêk thei a? Annawleh, ‘Thil fel lo i thaw a nih,’ tuin am ti thei a ta?"
"Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.","“A sinthaw chawimawi hlak ding chu hre zing la, Mihai khawma hlaa an inpâk hlak chu."
All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.,"Mihai po po chun chu chu an en a, Mi chun hlataka inthawkin a hmuh a."
"Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.","Ngai ta, Pathien chu a ropui a, ama chu ei hriet naw a nih; A kum tamzie khawm chu zawng suok ruollo a nih."
"For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,","Tui farhai chu chungtieng a lâk kâng a; Chuong chu, a tuihua inthawk chun ruoah an far thla sih a."
Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.,"Chuongchun, vânhai chun a hung bunthlâk a; Mi chunga chun tamtakin ân sûrtir a."
"Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?","Anih, mi tu bêkin amanih sûmhai inzar ziehai hi hre thei a ti, A biekbûk vâninrûmhai chu?"
"Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.","Ngai ta, ama vêla chun a var chu a phar a; Tuisuoriet limawng chu ân khum tah a."
For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.,"Hieng thilhai hin mipuihai ro chu a rêl sih a, Ama chun fâk ding tamtakin a pêk a."
"He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.","A kuthai chu kâwlinlepin ân khum a, A tumna tak fu dingin thu a pêk a."
"The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.","A vâninrûm chun thlipui hung chu a hril a, Ran ruol chen khawmin thlipui hung thu chu an hril a."
"Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.","“Hitaka khawm hin ka lungril chu ân thin a, A umna hmuna inthawk chun ân châwm a."
"Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.","A râwl ri chu ngai ta u, A baua inthawka ri suok le chun,"
"He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.",Vân hnuoi po poa chun a tir suok a; A kâwlinlep chu hnuoi tâwpnahai chenin a tir suok bawk a.
After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard.,"Chu hnunga chun râwl chu ân rih a, A ropuina râwl chun a hung sukri tah a; A râwl chu hriet a ni pha chun anni chu ân châwltir nawh a."
"God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.",Pathien chun a râwlin nasatakin a sukrih a; Thil ei hmu thei naw ropuitakhai chu a thaw a nih.
"For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.","Vûr kuoma chun, ‘Hnuoiah tla rawh,’ a ta; Chuong ang bawkin ruo mal kuoma le A ruo nasa sûrhai kuoma chun a ti bawk a."
"He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know it.","Mi tin kut chu a khârkhip a, Mi po pohai a siemhai chun an hriet theina dingin."
"Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.","Chun, ramsahai chu pûkahai chun an feh a, An kuoahai chun an um zing a."
"Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.","Simtieng pindana inthawk chun thlipui a hung a, Hmârtienga inthawkin phalbi a hung bawk a."
By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened.,Pathien thuok chun vûr inkhal chu a pêk a Tui lientakhai khawm an inkhal zo a.
"Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:","Anih, sûm sâtak chu tuihuin a sukrik a, A kâwlinlep sûm chu a thedar tah a."
"And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,","Chun, a ṭhuoinain ân let vêl a, Thu a pêk taphawt an thaw theina dingin; Khawvêl hluo theia um chung po poa chun."
"Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.","A hnuoi ta dingin amanih, sukdikna lem dingin amanih, Annawleh, zângaina leiin amani a hungtir hlak a."
"Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.","“Aw Job, hi hi ngai ta, To veng vengin Pathien sinthaw maktakhai chu ngaituo ta."
"Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?","An chunga chun Pathien chun ieng angin am maw ân phurtirin, A sûm kâwlinlep chu ân vartir hlak ti i hriet am?"
"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?","Sûm rikziehai chu i hriet am, Hrietna famkima sip, sinthaw maktak el chu?"
"How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?","Sim thli leia hnuoi chu a um ṭawk ṭawk laiin, Iengtin am i silfênhai chu suklumin a um a, ti i hriet am?"
"Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?","Ama ang chun vân khi keiphar thei i ti, Dârthlalang sungta anga ngar khi?"
Teach us what we shall say unto him; For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.,"Ama kuoma chun ieng am kan hril ding mîn chûktir la, Inthimna leiin kan thuhril chu kan sukrem thei si nawh a."
Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?,"Thu ka hril ding a nih ti chu ama hril a ni ding am a nih? Annawleh, mi chun lem zoa um chu a nuom am a nih?"
"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.","Tuhin mihai chun vânhaia var chu an hmu naw a nih; Amiruokchu, thli a hrâng a, anni chu a sukthiel hlak."
Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.,Hmârtienga inthawkin rângkachak ropuina chu a hung a; Pathien chu ropuina ṭiumtakin ân thuom a.
"Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.","Iengkimthawthei chu ei hmu suok thei nawh, Thilthawtheina le indiknaah a ropui a, Felna a hau a, nêksâwr naw nih."
Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.,"Chuleiin, mihai chun ama chu an ṭih a, Lungrila vara inngaihai khawm chu a pawisa chuong nawh,” tiin."
"Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,","Chun, thlivira inthawkin LALPA chun Job chu a hung dawn a, a hril tah a:"

"His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.","A lung chu lung anga ngar a na, Anih, bu râwtna lung hnuoihnung ang elin."
"When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.","Ama chu a hung tho pha chun, mi hrâthai chu an ṭih a: Ṭitna leiin anni chu an inhâwrkhâwm a."
"If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.","Miin kâwlhnâmin sât sien khawm sât pawp naw nih, Annawleh, fei khawmin, thal khawmin, hmawlzum khawmin sun pawp naw nih."
"He counteth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood.","Thîr chu bupâwl angin a ngai a, Dârsen chu thing hmawn angin."
The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.,"Thalhai chun ama chu a suktlân thei nawh a, Saihlumhai khawm chu ama kuoma chun pâwlbul ang a nih."
Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.,"Hmawlzumhai khawm chu pâwlbul ang chaua ngai a na, Fei inlap zawk zawkhai khawm chu a nuisan a."
His underparts are like sharp potsherds: He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.,"A hnuoihrût tieng chu bekawihâr ngei ang an na, Dûm chirdiek chu buchilna hrizâwl angin a hrût cham duoi a;"
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.,"Li inthûk chu bêl angin ân phultir a, Tuisuoriet chu thilhnâk angin a siem hlak."
He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.,"A hnunga chun a fêna lampui chu a sukhuom vâr a, Li inthûk chu mi chun hmul vâr amani a sâwn rau khawpin."
"Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.","Hnuoi chunga hin ama ang an um nawh a, Ṭitna nei loa siem chu."
He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.,"Thil insâng tinrêng chu a hmuh a, Chapona naupahai po po chunga lal a nih,” tiin."
"Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,","Chun, Job chun LALPA chu a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
"I know that thou canst do all things, And that no purpose of thine can be restrained.","“Thil po pohai chu i thaw thei vawng ti ka hriet a, I thiltum khawm dang ruol a ni nawh a."
"Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.","Hrietna um loa, thurâwn thuptu hi tu am a na? Chuleiin, ka ihriet naw chu ka hril el a nih;"
"Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.","Ngai ta, ka ngên che hi, thu ka hril ding a nih: Nang chu indawn ka ti che a, mi hrilfie bawk rawh."
I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; But now mine eye seeth thee:,"Naa hrietna chun nangma chu ka hriet ta cheh a, Tu ruok hin chu ka mit hin a hmu che a ni hi."
"Wherefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes.","Chuleiin, kei le kei kân theidah a, kân sîr a nih, Vuthai lai le pilvut laia ṭhungin,” tiin."
"And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.","Chun, LALPA chun Job kuoma hieng thuhai hi a hril zo chun LALPA chun, Teman mi Eliphaz kuoma chun, “Nanga chunga le i ruol pahni hai chunga chun ka lungsenna chu a hung zuol a nih, ka siehlaw Job anga keima chungthua thil indik chu in mi hrilpêk naw leiin."
"Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.","Chuleiin, tuhin bâwngchal pasa- ri le berâmchal pasari kei unla; ka siehlaw Job kuoma chun fe unla, nangni ta ngei dingin pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu inhlân ro; chun, ka siehlaw Job chun ṭawngṭaipêk a ti cheu a, ama a ni leiin, kei khawma pawm ka tih, in invêtna ang peia ka thaw nawna ding cheu in. Ka siehlaw Job angin keima chungthua thil indik chu in mi hrilpêk ta si nawh a,” tiin."
"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.","Chuongchun, Teman mi Eliphaz le, Suhi mi Bildad leh, Naamath mi Zophar le chun an feh a, LALPAIN anni thu a pêk ang chun an thawh a. Chun, LALPA chun Job chu a pawm- pêk tah a."
"And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.","Chun, LALPA chun Job chu a ruolhai ta dinga a ṭawngṭai lai chun a chan chu a sukṭha tah a; Job chu LALPA chun a hmaa a nei lêt hni chu a pêk tah a."
"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.","Chun, a unauhai po po, a farnu- hai po po leh, a hmaa a lo hmêlhriet tahai chu a kuomah an hung a, a ina chun ama leh bu an fâk tâwl a, a chunga LALPAIN thil ṭha naw ân tlungtir po pohaia chun ama chu an thlasietpuiin an thlamuon a, mi tin chun sum tlâwmte seng le, rângka- chak kutsebi an pêk seng a."
"So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Job chu a hun tâwp tieng chun a hun hmasa tieng nêk hmanin mal a sâwm tah a: berâm chu sîng khat le sâng li a nei a, sanghâwngsei sâng ruk leh, bâwngchal tuok sâng khat leh, sabengtungpui sâng khat a nei tah a."
He had also seven sons and three daughters.,Naupasal pasari le naunuhmei pathum a nei bawk a.
"And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.","Chun, a upatak hminga chun Jemima a sak a, a pahnina hminga chun Kezia, a pathumna hminga chun Keren-happuk a sak a."
And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.,"Chun, ram po poa chun Job nau- nuhmeihai anga hmêlṭha hrim hrim hmu an ni nawh a, an pa chun an unaupahai laia chun rochan a pêk seng bawk a."
"And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.","Hi hnunga hin Job chu kum za khat le sâwmli a la dam a, a nau- pasalhai le a naupasalhai naupasal- hai, khup li chenin a hmuh a."
"So Job died, being old and full of days.","Chuongchun, nihai chu tling zetin le hung tarin Job chu a thi tah a."
Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?,“Tuhin ko ta; nanga hung dawn che an um hrim am? Mi inthieng a tu tieng am a na i nghakîr ding?
"For vexation killeth the foolish man, And jealousy slayeth the silly one.","Lunginsenna chun mi invêt chu a sukhlumin, Îtthîkna chun mi intlâw chu a that hlak sih a."
I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.,"Mi invêt zungkei chu ka hmu tah a; Nisienlakhawm, a umna chu ṭawngsie kân phur nghâl hlak."
"His children are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:","A thlahai chu himnaa inthawka hlatakah an um a, Dâi kawtkhâr bula chun râwtdein an um a; Anni sansuok dingin tukhawm an um bawk nawh."
"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their substance.","A lohmasuok chu phîngṭâm chun a fâk zo a, Hlinghai laia mi khawm chu a lâk suok hlak a; A thil neihai dingin châng chu ân kam zing hlak."
"For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;",Tuorna hi pilvut laia inthawkin a hung suok ngai si nawh a; Buoina khawm hi leihnuoia inthawkin a hung mâwng suok ngai bawk nawh;
"But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.","Amiruokchu, mihriem chu buoinaa hung pieng a ni lem, Meisihai chungtienga a vuong ang elin."
"But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;","“Ka chungthua chun Pathien tieng zawng ka ta, Pathien kuomah ka chungthu chu inkawltir ka tih."
"Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number:",Thil ropuitakhai le zawng suok ruol lohai chu thawh a; Thil maktakhai tiem sêng lo thawtu chu.

"He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.","Themthiem remruotnahai chu a sukthlâwn a, Chuongchun, an kuthai chun an nuom zâwng chu a puitlin thei nawh."
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.,Mi varhai chu an var vervêknain a âwk a; Mi vervêkhai inrâwnna chu a letlingin a siem hlak.
"They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night.","Sûn huna chun inthimna leh an intuok a, Sûnchang lai zâna ang elin an inmai hlak."
"But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.","An baua kâwlhnâma inthawk chu fahrahai a sanhim a, Mi tlasamhai chu mi hrât kuta inthawkin a sansuok hlak."
"So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.","Chuongchun, mi rimsi chun beiseina a hung nei a, Rîtlona chun a bau ân chîp tah a."
"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.","“Ngai ta, mi Pathienin a sukdik chu a va hlim de! Chuleiin, Iengkimthawthei thununna chu hmusit naw rawh."
"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole.","Pânna a siem a, a tuom a, A sukhliem a, a kuthai chun a sukdam sih a."
"He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.","Buoina paruka inthawkin sansuok a ti cheh a, Anih, pasaria thil ṭha naw hrimin nang tâwk ta naw ni che."
In famine he will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.,Ṭâm lai chun thinaa inthawkin sansuok a ti che a; Indo lai chun kâwlhnâm thilthawtheinaa inthawkin sansuok a ti che.
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.,Lei hrilsietnaa inthawk chun thuphmang nîng i ta; Sukbohmangna a hung tlung pha khawm ṭi bawk naw ti nih.
At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.,"Sukbohmangnaa le ṭâmnaa chun innui i ta, Hnuoi chunga sahrânghai khawm ṭi bawk naw ti nih."
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.,Rama lunghai le chun inthuruol tâng in ta; Rama sahrânghai khawm chu nang le inremin um tâng an tih.
"And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.","Chun, i puon in chu a râlmuong ti hrieng i ta; I ran in chu va sir i ta, iengkhawm inhmang naw nih."
"Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.",I chithla chu a hung ropui ding a nih ti hre bawk i ta; I thlahai chu hnuoi chunga hlobet ang elin.

"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
"Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!","“Aw ka lungzîngnahai hi bûk vawng thei ni sien, Ka vângduoinahai hi bûknahaia bûk vawng ni sien chu aw!"
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.,"Tuisuoriet phâiphin nêkin a rik âwm sih a; Chuleiin, ka thuhai hi a rawp ta a ni hi."
"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.","Iengkimthawthei thalhai chu keimaa hin a um a, Chutaka a tûr chu ka thlarau hin a dâwn sih a; Pathien ṭiumnahai chu kei mi epin an intlar a."
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?,"Ram sabengtung chu hlobet a hmu sûng chun ân hrâm hlak am a nih? Annawleh, bâwngchal chu a hlo pet ding chungah ân bu hlak am a nih?"
Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?,"Thil alna nei lo chu chi boin fâk thei a ni hlak am a nih? Annawleh, ârtui puovâra hin inhnikna hrim a um am a nih?"
My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.,"Ka lungrilin anni a tâwk nuom nawh a, Ka ta dingin bu tirdakumtak ang an nih."
Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!,"“Aw ka ihni hi nei thei lang, Pathienin thil ka ichâk hi mi phalpêk sien chu aw!"
"Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!",Kei mi nuoihâwp dingin Pathien suklungâwi ni sien chu; A kut hung inletin mi sât thla el sienla!
"And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.","Chuongchun, lungmuongna la nei ka ta; Anih, natna a chuong a liem um ta loa khawm hin insukpasal ka tih; Mi inthieng thuhai chu kân phat ngai si nawh a."
"What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?","Ka hrâtna chu ieng am a na, ka la nghâk phawt ding chu? Ka tâwpna khawm chu ieng am a na, ka tuor ṭâl ṭâlna ding chu?"
Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?,"Ka hrâtna hi lunghai hrâtna am a nih? Annawleh, ka taksa hi dârsen am a nih?"
"Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?","Hrâtna ti ding êm ka nei nawh a, Ṭhangpuina hmuna ding hrim khawm ka nei nawh,"
To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.,“Châu dêra um ṭêp chunga chun a ruol chun lunginsietna a nei ding a nih; Iengkimthawthei ṭîna nghatsantu ngei kuoma chun.
"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;","Ka unauhai chun vadungtê angin khawhlotakin an thawh a, Vadung tui inrelhmang hlakhai ang el chun."
"Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself:",Chuong chu tuikhal leiin an dum a; Chutaka chun vûr chu ân thup a nih.
"What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.","A hung lum pha chun an bohmang a; A lum pha chun, an hmuna inthawkin an bohmang hlak."
"The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.","An fêna lampuiahai sanghâwngsei ruol inzinhai chu an fe pêt a; Iengkhawm ni loah an feh a, an bohmang a."
"The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.",Tema sanghâwngsei pâwlruol chun an en a; Seba pâwlhai chun an lo nghâk zing a.
"They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.","Beiseina an nei leiin an inzak a; Chutaka chun an hung a, an beidawng tah a."
"For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.","Ka chungah chuong ang chau chu in nih; Ka siet tuok in hmuh a, in ṭih a."
"Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?","‘Ka kuomah mi pe unla,’ Annawleh, in thilneihaia hin thilpêk mi pe ro, ka ti cheu am a nih?"
"Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?","Annawleh, ‘hmêlma kuta inthawkin mi sansuok unla,’ Annawleh, ‘nêksâwrtuhaia inthawkin mîn tlan ro,’ ka ti am a nih?"
"Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.","Nangnîn mîn chûktir unla, chuongchun, to ṭawk el ka tih; Ka sukdik nawnahaia chun hre dingin mi siem bawk unla."
"How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?","Felna thuhai chu a va hrât ngei de! Amiruokchu, in sêlkalnahai chun ieng am a sukfie a?"
"Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?",Thu ringawt chu zil thei in inring am a nih? Mi beidawng thuhrilhai chu thli ang chau ni si chu.
"Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.","Anih, fahra chunga chun âihai in sân a; In ruolhai chu sumhlâwknain in nei a."
Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.,"Tuhin mi en hman unla, In hmaisana hin inkhêl tawp si naw ning a."
"Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.","Hung ngha ta u, ka ngên cheu hi, indik nawna hrim um naw raw se; Anih, hung ngha kîr ro, ka chungthu hi ân dik sih a."
Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?,Ka leia hin indik nawna hrim a um am a nih? Ka bau intemna hin thil khawhlohai chu a thlier thei naw am a nih?”
Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?,“Hnuoi chunga hin mihriem chun sin thaw ding a nei zing ni lo am a nih? A nihai khawm chu inhlawfa ni ang a ni naw am a nih?
"As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:","Siehlaw, deihlim inhnar ngâwi ngâwi angin le, Inhlâwfa a hlawhai ngawt en ang el chun:"
"So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.","Thla teplohai chu hmang dinga siem ka na, Zân tuorhlaumtakhai chu ka ta dinga ruot a ni tah a."
"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.","Ka zâl pha chun, ‘Iengtik am tho ka tih aw? Zân chu a sâwt ngei,’ ka tih a; Zîngkhaw hung var chenin kân let kân let a."
"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.","Ka taksa chu pilvut khâwnhai le ngêhaia thuomin a um a; Ka vun chu a hung inhlip a, a tharin a hung suok tah a."
"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope.",Ka nihai chu puon khâwngtu khawthei nêkin a hrât lem a; Beiseina hrim um loa sukthâm an nih.
Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine eye shall no more see good.,"Aw, ka hringna hi thli el a nih ti hre zing la, Ka mit hin thil ṭha hmu nâwk ta naw nih."
"The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.","Mit a mi hmutu khan mi hmu ta naw nih a; I mithaiin mi hung en a ta, nisienlakhawm, um ta naw ning."
"As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.","Sûm chu a hung inzâm a, a hung ral angin; Chuong ang chun, Seola fetahai chu hung nâwk ta naw ni hai."
"He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more.",A ina chun hung kîr ta naw nih a; A hmun chun ama chu hre ta bawk naw ni.
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.,"“Chuleiin, ka bau hi insûm naw ning a, Ka thlarau thuokdawng hin thu hril ka tih; Ka lungril rimsiknaa hin sawisêl ka tih."
"Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me?","Tuisuoriet am ka ni, tuisuorieta ngapui am ka ni. Keima chunga vêngtu i sie chu?"
"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint;","‘Ka khumin mi sukhlim a ta, Ka zâlkhum chun ka sawisêlna chu mi suknêppêk a tih,’ ka ti hlak chun."
"Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions:",Nangin manghaiin i mi suklâu a; Mitthlaa thilhmuhaiin i mi sukṭih a.
"So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones.","Chuongchun, ka lungril chun inâwkhlum le thina a thlang a nih; Hieng ka ruhai ngawt nêk hin chu."
I loathe my life; I would not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.,"Ka hringna chu ka sêngral a; dam sâwt naw ningah, Mâkhâtin mîn umtir el rawh; ka nihai chu teplo el an ni sih a."
"What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,","Mihriem hi ieng am a nih a, ama chu i chawimawi a; Amaa chun i lungril în nghat a,"
"And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment?","Zîng tin ela i hung sir hlak a, Mitkhapkâr tina i fie hlak hi?"
"How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?","Iengchen am keia tieng ngha lo loin um i ta, Ka chil lem kâr el khawma makhâta i mîn umtir naw ding chu?"
"If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself?","Ka lo suol a ni khawmin, i chungah ieng am ka thaw a na, Aw, Nang mihriemhai vêngtu?

"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.","Iengdinga ka bawsietna hi i ngaidam nawh a, Ka rîtlona hi i lâk hmang naw?

"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,","Bildad Suhi mi chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
How long wilt thou speak these things? And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?,“Ieng chen am hieng thuhai hi i hril ding a na? Ieng chen am i baua thuhai chu thli hrâttak ang a ni ding a na?
Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?,"Pathien chun a ngaidân chu a sukdanglam hlak am a nih? Annawleh, Iengkimthawthei chun indikna chu a sukdanglam hlak am a nih?"
"If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;","I nauhaiin a chungah thil an suksuol chun, An bawsietna kuta chun anni chu a pêk hlak a."
"If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;","Pathien chu nguntaka i zawng suok a, Iengkimthawthei kuoma i hnina chu i siem a;"

"And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.","I ṭanna chu chitê ni sienla khawm, A hnunga i tâwpna chu nasatakin hung pung a tih."

"Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?","Nang chu inchûktir chein, hril chein, An lungrila an hrietna ṭhahai chu hril suok lo ding am an nih?"
Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water?,Dûm hnâwnga naw thielkuong a mâwng thei am a nih? Tui um loin phaiphêng a mâwng thei am a nih?

So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish:,Pathien theinghiltu po pohai lampuihai chu chuong ang chu an na; Pathien ngaisak nawhai beiseina chu bohmang a tih.
"Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider’s web.","Chuonghai ringsan tak chu kawidar vawng a ta, Chuonghai ringsan chu aiumrîl ang a nih."

"If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.","A hmuna inthawka suksiet a ni chun, ‘Nang ka hmu naw cheh a,’ tiin ama chu inphat a tih."
"Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring.","Ngai ta, hi hi a lampui hlimna chu a nih; Chu pila inthawk chun mi danghai hung mâwng an tih."
"Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.","Ngai ta, Pathien chun mi fel chu pei thla naw nih a, Thil suol thawtu chu tungding bawk naw ni."
"He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.","I bau chu innuinain la suksip a ta, I hmûrhai chu khêkriin suksip a tih."
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.,"Nangma theidatuhai chu inzaknain inkhum nîng an ta, Mi khawhlo puon in chu um ta dêr bawk naw nih,” tiin."
"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God?,"“Chuong ang chu a nih ti indiktakin ka hriet a, Nisienlakhawm, mi chu iengtin am Pathien hmaa chun mi indiktak ni thei a ta?"
"If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand.","Ama le inkhing chu nuom ang sien khawm, Sâng khat laia pakhata khawm ama chu dawn thei naw nih."
"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?—","Ama chu lungrila var, hrâtnaa thilthawthei a na, Ama chunga insukngara hlawtling tu am um an ta?"
"Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger;","Ama chun tlânghai chu a sawn a, an hriet si nawh a, An lunginsena anni a thâilet lai chun;"
"That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble;","Hnuoi chu ama hmuna chun a sukhnîng a, Chutaka banhai khawm chu ân hnîng bawk a."
"That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars;","Nisa chu thu a pêk a, a hung suok ta nawh a; Arasihai chu a khârkhip bawk a."
"That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;",Ama chun vânhai chu a keiphar a; Tuisuoriet fâwnhai chungah kal a chawi a.
"That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;","Zângkawlawi dâm, Sîruk dâm le, Sîzucho dâm siemtu le, Simtieng kâwlkawdawng hai siemtu chu."
"That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number.","Ama chun inhmaa thil hriet suok ruollohai chu a thawh a; Anih, thilmak tiem sêng lohai chu."
"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.","En ta, ka kâwla chun a feh a, ama chu ka hmu nawh a, A fe pei a, ama chu ka hriet si nawh."
"Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?","En ta, a lâk el a, tuin am dang thei a ta? ‘Ieng am i thawh a?’ tuin am a kuomah tîng a ta?"
God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.,"“Pathien chun a lungsen chu la kîr naw nih a, Rahab ṭhangpuituhai chu a hnuoiah an kûn ngei kha."
"How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words to reason with him?",Kei taktê hin iengtin am ama dawn ka ta? Ama kalin khâwlai ka ieng thu tak am phawr thei ka ta?
"Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.","Kei chu mi fel ni lang khawm, la dawn naw ning a; Ka chungthu rêltu ding kuoma chun hnina siem lem ka tih."
"If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.",Ama ka ko chun a mi hung dawn hlak a; Ama chun ka râwl chu a ngai naw am a ni ka la sâwn rawp a.
"For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause.","Thlipui chu mîn nuoitirin, A san boin ka hliemnahai chu a sukpung tah a."
"He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness.",Ka thuok lâk ding chu mi ngaithei naw nih a; Khâknain mi suksip lem a tih.
"If we speak of strength, lo, he is mighty! And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me?","Hrâtna thu ei hril chun ama chu thilthawthei a na! Rorêlna thu hril inla, tuin am ama chu ko thei a ta?"
"Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.","Kei chu mi fel ni lang khawm ka bau ngeiin thiemnaw mîn chan a ta; Kei chu mi tluongtak ni lang khawm, kâwmâwah mîn chan a tih."
I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life.,Mi tluongtak ka na; kei le kei kân ngaisâng nawh a; Ka hringna chu ka hmusit a;
"It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.","A rêngin angkhat vawng a nih; chu lei chun annâwm, ‘Ama chun mi tluong le mi khawhlo khawm chu a suksiet ve ve,’ ka ti chu."
"If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.","Vuokna chun a sukhlum nghâl chun, Mi pawitâwklo vângduoina chu nuisan a tih."
"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If it be not he, who then is it?","Hnuoi hi mi khawhlo kuta chun pêk a na, Chu chun rorêltuhai hmaihai chu ama chun ân khum a nih. Ama a ni naw chun, tu am nîng a ta?"
"Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good.","“Tuhin ka nihai chu thangkohai nêkin an hrât lem a; An tlân hmang a, thil ṭha hrim an hmu nawh."
They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.,Lawnglien hrâthai angin an fe hmang a; Mupui a sa fâk ding chunga a bir ang elin.
"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer;","‘Ka sawisêlna theinghil ka ta, Ka hmêl lungngai hi sie hmang ka ta, Hlimtakin um ka tih,’ ti lang:"
"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.","Ka lungngainahai po po chu ka ṭih a, Nang chun pawitâwkloah mi sie naw ti ni ti ka hriet sih a."
I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?,"Thiemnaw inchangtirin um ngei ka tih; Chuong sa chun, a thlâwn elin ienga dîm lân rim rawp ka ta?"
"If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;","Vûrtuiin kei chu insilin, Ka kuthai chu changalin sâwp lang khawm,"
"Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me.","Nang chun khura chun mi phûm tho i ta, Ka silfênhai ngei chun mi tirdak an tih."
"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.","Ama chu ka dawn dingin keima anga mihriem a ni si nawh a, Rorêlnaa hang ngîr hmunkhatpui ding êm chun."
"There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both.",Kan inkârah ṭheltu tukhawm an um nawh a: Kan chunga kut innghat ve ve theitu ding chu.
"Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid:","Keimaa inthawkin a hmawl chu la hmang sienla, A ṭiumnahai chun mi sukṭi ta naw raw se,"
"Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.","Chuongchun, ama ṭi loin thu hril ka tih. Keimaa hin chuong ang chu ka ni si nawh a."
