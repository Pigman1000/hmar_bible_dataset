The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just.,"Mi fel lampui chu indikna a na, nang lungril indiktak put chun mi fel lampui chu i sukruol hlak."
"Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; to thy name, even to thy memorial name, is the desire of our soul.","Anih, Aw LALPA, i rorêlna lam- puia chun kan nghâk zing cheh a, kan hringna dit zâwng chu i hming tieng le i hriet zingna tieng hi a nih."

"Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.","Ngai ta, hi luong hmawl pawr, Aigupta hi, i ring a ni hi, chu chu miin a ringsan chun a kutah sunlût ngei a tih; Aigupta lal Pharao chu ama ringtuhai po po chunga chun chuong ang chu a ni hlak."
"But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?","Annawleh, ka kuomah, LALPA kan Pathien chu a nih kan ring chu, i ti chun, ama chu Hezekia chun Judahai kuoma le Jerusalem mihai kuomah, Hi mâichâm hmaa chau hin inbiek ding a nih, tiin, a bâwlhmun le a mâichâmhai a lâk hmangpêk kha a ni nâwm a nih?"
"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.","Chuongchun, ka hni che hi, ka pu Assuria lal kuoma chun thu tiem rawh, chuongchun, keiin sakawr sâng hni pêng ka ti che, nangin a chunga chuongtu dinghai i ngaituo thei ding phawt chun."

"Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.","Chun, Eliakim le Sebna le Joa hai chun Rabsake kuomah, “Kan hni che hi i siehlawhai hi Suria ṭawngin mi be ta rawh, chu chu kan hriet thei si a; kul bang chunga mihai na hrietah Juda ṭawngin mi be ta naw raw khai,” an tih a."
"But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?","Nisienlakhawm, Rabsake chun, “Ka pu chun in pu kuom chau le in kuom chaua hieng thu hi hril dingin a mi tir am a nih?

"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.","Chun, Rabsake chu a ngîr a, Juda ṭawngin râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Lal ropuitak Assuria lal thuhai hi lo ngai ro."
"Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:","Lal chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hezekia hlêmin um nuom naw ro; ama chun a sandam thei âwm si naw cheu a,"
"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","Hezekia chun, LALPA chun matheiloin mi sandam ngei a tih; hi khawpui hi Assuria lal kutah pêkin um naw nih, tiin hril sienla khawm LALPA chu Hezekian a hril lei elin ring nuom chuong naw ro."
"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;","Hezekia thu ngai naw ro, Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a hril sih a, Mîn rempui unla ka kuoma hin hung suok ro, mi tinin mâni grêp hruia mi le mi tinin mâni theichang kûnga mi fa seng unla, mi tinin mâni tuikhur tui dâwn seng ro:"

"Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?","LALPAIN mi sandam a tih, tîn, Hezekia hin thlêm hlau rawi a ti cheu, fîmkhur ro.

Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?,Hamath le Arpadhai pathienhai kha khâw lai am an um tah a? Sepharvaimhai pathienhai kha khâw lai am an um tah a? Samari khuo kha keimaa inthawk khan an sanhim ta am a nih?
"Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?","Chuong ram pathienhai po po laia mi chun tuhaiin am an ram keimaa inthawkin an sanhim ta hlak leh?

"But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.","Anni ruok chu an to zing a, bau khat khawma an dawn nawh; lal thupêk chu, “Ama chu dawn naw ro,” ti a ni sih a."
"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.","Chuongchun, lal sûnghai chunga hotua um Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai chu silfên keithlêr inbelin Hezekia kuoma chun an hung tlung a, Rabsake thuhrilhai chu an hril tah a."
"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.","Lal Hezekia chun chu chu a hriet phingleh a silfênhai chu a keithlêr a, saiip puon ân bel a, LALPA ina chun a lût tah a."
"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.","Chun, a sûnghai chunga hotua um Eliakim le lekhaziektu Sebna le thiempuhai upahai chu saiip puon inbelin Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai kuomah a tir a."
"And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hezekia chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Vawisûn ni hi lunginzîngna ni le hmingsietna ni a nih, nauhai chu an pieng a hun ta sih a; anni chu nei dingin hrâtna a um ta si nawh,"
"It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.","Rabsake, a pu Assuria lalin Pathien hring hrilse dinga a itirpa thuhrilhai chu LALPA i Pathienin a naa a hriethai chun la kâwk ngei a tih; chuleiin, hlabîka la umhai ta ding hin i ṭawngṭâina chu hang inhlân rawh,’ a tih a,” an ta."
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.,"Chuongchun, lal Hezekia sie- hlawhai chu zâwlnei Isai kuoma chun an hung a."
"And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.","Isai chun an kuomah, “In pu kuoma chun hieng ang hin in hril ding a nih, ‘LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, I thu hriet, Assuria lal siehlawhaiin an mi hrilsietnahai kha ṭi naw rawh."

"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.","Chuong lai chun Hezekia chu thi ngamin a nah a; Chun, Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai chu a kuomah a hung a, a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘I sûnghai khawsak dân ding rêlpêk rawh; dam suok loin, i thi ngei ding a ni sih a,’ tiin,” a ta."
"Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah,","Chuongchun, Hezekia chu bang tieng ngha chun ân let a, LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a."
"and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.

"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.","Tuhin, aw Jerusalema umhai le Juda mihai, lunginsiettakin kei le ka grêp huon inkâra thu hi mi ngai- tuopêk ta u khai."
"What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?",Ka grêp huona hin ka thaw ta ang bâk khan chu a chungah ieng am thaw nâwk chuong ding a la um ta rawp a? Grêp raa ra dinga ka beisei vei le khan ieng leia grêp suoka a hung ra el am a ni aw?
"And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:","Tuhin ka grêp huon chunga ka thaw ding chu hril ka ti cheu; a hling pal chu la hmang ka ta, fâk zoin um a ta, a lung pal chu sukchim ka ta, sirdein um a tih."
and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.,"Sukrêm vawng ka ta; sâtderin um naw nih a, cho phitin um bawk naw nih; buor le hlohlingneihai mâwng lem a tih; sûmhai khawm a chungah ruo hrim hrim insûrtir lo dingin thu pe bawk ka tih."
"For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.","Sipaihai LALPA grêp huon chu Israel sûngkuo hi a na, Juda mihai hi a kûng ditumtak chu an ni sih a; rorêlna fel a beisei a, nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, nêksâwrna a hung um ta lem a; felna a beisei a, nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, khêk ri a hung um ta lem a nih."
"Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!","Ram lailia an khât chaua an um theina dinga mi ṭhang vena hmun hrim hrim um lo khawp hiel a, in le in inzawmtir pei le, lo le lo inzawmtir peituhai chung chu a rik ie!"
"In mine ears saith Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.","Sipaihai LALPA chun ka naah hieng ang hin a tih, “Titakzetin in tamtak, lientak tak, mawitak takhai chu a thlûttu um loin la ram a ta;"
"For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.","Grêp huon ṭin sâwm hmunah bath khat chau la pieng a ta, bu chi homer khat tuin epha khat chau a la pieng ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!","Zu hnawt dinga zîngkâr inhma- taka tho a, uoinin a sukrui bûr hma- khat chena zân sâwttak tak chena um hlakhai chu an chung a rik."
"And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.","Ṭingṭang le perkhuonghai, khuongtê le theihlehai, uoin leh an ruoiṭhenaahai chun a um hlak a, nisienlakhawm, LALPA sinthaw chu an ngaisâng ngai nawh a, a kut thil- thaw chu an ngaituo ngai bawk nawh."
"Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.","Chuleiin, ka mihai chu, hrietna an nei naw leiin, sala ṭhuoiin an um tah a; an mi inzâumhai chu an phîng a ṭâm a, an mipuihai chu dangchârin an dang ân hil zo tah a."
"Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend into it.","Chuleiin, Seol chun a châkna chu a lo suklien a, a bau chu inkhi ruollo khawpin a ka tah a, chuong- chun, an ropuina dâm, an mipuihai dâm, an ropui bûr bûrna dâm, anni laia lâwmtaka umhai le chun an lût thla ta duol duol a."
"And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:","Mi chînhai chu sukkûnin an um a, mi lienhai chu suktlâwmin an um a, chapo mithai chu sukhnuoiin a um tah a;"
"but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.","sipaihai LALPA ruok chu rorêl- naa chawisângin a um ta lem a, Pathien, Mi Inthieng chu felnaa suk- thiengin a um tah a."
"Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.","Chun, berâmtehai chu an tlatna hmuna an tla angin tlâng an ta, mi thau hnekhnukhai hmun rama thil- hai chu invâihaiin fâng an tih."
"Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;","Iengkhawm ni lo hruihruola khawhlona kei a, tawlailîr hruihruola kei ang suolna kei hlaktuhai chu an chung a rik ie!"
"that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!","“Eini hmuna dingin thaw vak sienla, a thil thaw ding chu thaw vak raw se, ei hriet theina dingin Israel- hai Mi Inthieng remruot chu hung hnaiin hung tlung raw se,” ti hlak- tuhai chu."
"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!","Thil ṭha naw chu thil ṭha ti a, thil ṭha chu thil ṭha naw ti hlaka, var chu inthima ngaia, inthim chu vara ngai hlaka, thil thlum chu thil khaa ngaia, thil kha chu thil thluma ngai hlaktuhai chu an chung a rik ie!"
"Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!",Mâni ngaia varhai le mâni ngaia bengvârhai chu an chung a rik ie!
"Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;","Uoin dâwn kawnga mi hrâttak, zu chawkpawl kawnga thahrui nei mihai chu an chung a rik ie,"
"that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!","thamna fâk leia misuol thiem inchangtir hlaka, mi fel felna lâkpêk hlaktuhai chu!"
"Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.","Chuleiin, meichawkin bupâwl a liek hmang duok duok hlak ang le, hlohna ṭâwl chu meichawka a tlu zawt zawt angin an zung chu hmawn- na angin um a ta, an pâr chu pilvut angin intung lui lui a tih; sipaihai LALPA dân chu an dit nawh a, Israel- hai Mi Inthieng thu chu an ngainêp leiin."
"Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Chuleiin, LALPA lung chu a mihai chungah ân thawk a, a kut chu an chungah ân let a, a vuok a, chuongchun, tlânghai chu an inthin dur dur a, an ruonghai chu khawlai dungah hmunhnawk ang elin ân hlum rem rum a. Chuong lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a la bo chuong nawh a; a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
"And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.","Hnam tin hlataka mihai ta dingin inchikna târ suok a ta, kâwl- kawdawnga inthawka ko dingin fai- fûk a tih; chuongchun, ngai ta, anni chu inhmâwtakin hung vak an tih."
"None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:","Anni laia tukhawm sâwl naw ni hai a, insui bawk naw ni hai; tukhawm inlusu naw ni hai a, ininnghil bawk naw ni hai; an kâwngkhi chu sûtthâwlin um naw nih a, an kekawk khitna chu intan bawk naw nih;"
"whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:","an thalhai chu inzumtak a na, an thalngulhai po po chu kuoi sain a um ṭhup a; an sakawr tinhai chu meitâwklung ang nîng an ta, an tawlailîr kehai chu thlivir ang ela ngai ni bawk an tih."
"their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.","An ri inri dur dur chu sakei- baknei inrûm ang el nîng a ta, sakeibaknei vânglaihai inhûk ang elin inri dur dur an tih; anih, inri dur dur an ta, an sa se ding chu sêng an ta, himtakin fe hmangpui an tih, san- suoktu ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."
"And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.","Chu nia chun tuisuoriet inri dur dur angin an chungah inri dur dur an ta, chuongchun, miin ram chu an hei thlîr chun, ngai ta, inthim le lungin- zingna ruok nîng a tih, var hlak chu chutaka sûmahai chun sukthimin a um a."
"Thus saith Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, “In nu mâkna lekha, ka mâkna chu, khaw lai am a um a?

"Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.","Ieng leiin am ka hung khan mi hrim hrim an um nawh a?

"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.","Vân khi inthimnain kân thuom hlak a, saiip puon ân khumna dingin ka siem hlak,” tiin."
"The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of them that are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught.","Mi sâwltak chu thua ka suksâwl- dam theina dingin LALPA Pathien chun inchûktirhai lei a mi pêk a; ama chun tûk tinin a keihar a, inchûk- tirhaiin an hriet anga hre dingin ka na hi a keihar hlak."
"The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun ka na a mi sukhawngpêk a, kei chu ka hel nawh a, ka ngha kîr bawk nawh."
"I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.","Ka ruongzâng hi vawtuhai kuom- ah ka dawh a, ka bienghai hi hmul phawituhai kuomah ka daw bawk a; muolphonaa le chilsâkkhumnaah ka hmai ka hup nawh."
"For the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun a mi ṭhangpui ding a ni sih a; chuleiin, kân zak ngai nawh a; chuleiin, meitâwk- lung ang tlatin ka ngha hlak, muol- pho naw ning ti ka hriet."
He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand up together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.,"Thiem mîn changtirtu chu a hnai a, tuin am mi do a ta? Ngîr ve vêng ei tih; a mi dotu chu tu am a ni leh? Mi hung hnai raw se."
"Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.","Ngai ta, Lalpa PATHIEN chun mi ṭhangpui a tih; tuin am thiemnaw mîn changtir a ta? Ngai ta, chuonghai po po chu silfên angin la hlui a ta, hângthimin fa se vawng a tih."
"Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.","Nangni laia LALPA chu ṭih a, a siehlaw thuawi chu, tu am a na? Inthima lênga var hrim hrim nei naw chun LALPA hming chu ring sienla, a PATHIEN chungah innghat raw se."
"Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.","Mei sêm a, thingthu tivar hlak po pohai, ngai ta u, in mei vara le in thingthu tihai lai chun lêng ro.

"Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye were digged.","Felna hnawttuhai, LALPA zawngtuhai, ka thu hi lo ngai ta u; nangni sutna lungpui tieng le khursûnga nangni cho suokna khur tieng kha en ta u."
"Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.","In pu Abraham tieng le nangni neitu cheu Sara tieng kha en ro; ama chu pakhat chau a ni lai khan ka ko a, mal ka sâwm a, mi tamtakah ka siem ta kha."
"For Jehovah hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.","LALPA chun Zion chu a thla- muon ta sih a; a hmun se tahai po po chu a thlamuon a, a thlalêr chu Eden angin a siem a, a ram ṭâwl chu LALPA huon angin a siem bawk a; chutaka chun lâwmna le hlimna dâm, lâwmthu hrilna le hla sak ri dâm um a tih."
"Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.","Aw ka mihai, ka thu hi lo ngai unla; aw ka hnamhai, ka thua hin na lo sit ta u; keimaa inthawkin dân thu a hung suok ding a ni sih a, mi tin enna dingin ka rorêlna chu inchâwltir ka tih."
"My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust.","Ka felna chu a hnai a, ka san- damna chu a suok tah a, ka bânhai hin mi tin ro rêlpêk a tih, thlierkârhai chun mi nghâk an ta, ka bân hi ring an tih."
"Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.","Vân tienga hai khin in mit hang inlên unla, hnuoi tienga leihnuoi chu en ro: vân khi meikhu angin lân zâm hmang a ta, leihnuoi hi silfên angin la hlui a tih, a sûnga umhai chu chuong ang bawk chun la thîng an tih; ka sandamna ruok hi chu kumkhuoin um a ta, ka felna khawm hi sukboin um naw ni."
"Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings.","Felna hretu, ka dân thu lungrila vawn mihai, ka thu hi lo ngai ro, mihriemhai hrilsietna ṭi naw unla, an halna cheu leiin lunginzîng bawk naw ro."
"For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation unto all generations.","Hângthimin silfên a fâk siet vawng angin anni chu a fâk siet vawng ding a ni sih a, a ngein sahmul a fâk angin anni chu a fâk ding a ni sih a; ka felna ruok chu kumkhuoin um a tih, ka sandamna chu suon po po chenin um bawk a tih."
"Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the monster?","Aw LALPA bân, har la, har la, hrâtna thar inbel rawh; tienlaia, tien- lai suonhai um laia i har ang khan har rawh.

"And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.","Chun, LALPA intlanhai chu kir nâwk an ta, hla sak pumin Zion chu tlung an tih; chatuona lâwmna an lu chungahai chun um tâng a ta, lâwmna le hlimna hmûng an ta, lungngaina le inrûmna chu bo tâng a tih."

"And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.","Chun, vân khi ka keiphar thei a, leihnuoi innghatsan chu ka phûm thei a, Zionhai kuomah, “Ka mihai in nih,” ka ti theina dingin ka thuhai chu i bauah ka sie a, ka kutin ka hum che a nih."
"Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.","Aw Jerusalem, LALPA kuta inthawka a lunginsenna noa mi dâwntunu, har la, har la, tho rawh, nang chun pêm pêmna no berbua mi chu i dâwn a, i dâwn fai rêt a."
There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand among all the sons that she hath brought up.,A naupasal neihai po po lai chun ama ṭhuoitu ding tukhawm an um nawh a; a naupasal châwm lienhai po po lai chun a kuta chel tukhawm an um bawk nawh.

"Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.","I naupasalhai chu an châu a, sakêl lêna a âwk angin kawtthlêr tâwp tienga chun an zâl phung a, LALPA lunginsenna le i Pathien kâwkna chun an sip tah a nih."
"Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:","Chuleiin, nang sukrinum le uoin inrui ni si loa mi inrui, hi hi lo hre ta rawh:"
"Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again:","i LALPA Jehova, i Pathien, a mihai thu hrilpui hlaktu chun hieng ang hin a tih; “Ngai ta, pêm pêm- na no, ka lunginsenna no berbu ngei chu, i kuta inthawkin ka lâk suok tah; dâwn nâwk ta naw ti ni;"

"Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit on thy throne, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.","Aw Jerusalem, pilvut i kai kha inthin rawh, tho la, ṭhung rawh; aw Zion naunu, sala um, i rîng khuop- nahai kha sût rawh."

"Now therefore, what do I here, saith Jehovah, seeing that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them do howl, saith Jehovah, and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.","Chuongchun, hitaka hin tuhin ieng am a na ka thaw ding?

"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!","Tlângahai chanchin ṭha intluna, inremna thu khêkpuia, thil ṭha chanchin ṭha intluna, sandamna thu khêkpuia, Zion kuomah, “I Pathien chu lalah a ṭhung,” tituhai ke chu a va mawi de!"
"The voice of thy watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah returneth to Zion.","Ngai rawh, i râl vêngtuhai râwl chu!

"For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight: for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward.","Inhmâwtakin in fe suok âwm si nawh a, tlânsiein fe bawk naw ti niu; LALPA chun in hma a ṭhuoi ding a ni sih a; Israelhai Pathien chu in hnung dâltu nîng a tih."

"Like as many were astonished at thee (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),","Mi tamtakin mak an ti hle che angin, (a hmêl chu mihriem hmêl nêk hmana suksietin a um a, a pienken chu mihriem nauhai pienken nêk hmana suksietin a um a),"
so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.,"hnam tamtakin maktîng an tih; lalhaiin a kuoma chun an bau lân chîp an ta, an kuoma hril ngai lo chu la hmûng an ta, naa an hriet ngai naw chu an ngaithiem ding a nih."
Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?,Kan thuhril tuin am a ring a? LALPA kut chu tu kuom am ân lang a?
"For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.","A hmaa chun thil ṭo innotak angin ama chu ân dâwn suok sih a, hnuoi ṭâwla zung angin a hung kak suok bawk a nih; pienken ṭhatna le hmêl mawina hrim hrim a nei nawh a, ama ei hmuin ama ei ditna dingin mawina hrim hrim a nei nawh."
"He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.","Ama chu mihriemhai hmusit le dit nawin a um a; lungngainahai nei mi le natna hre mi a na, mihaiin an hmai an hipsan ang ang chun ama chu hmusitin a um a, eini hlak chun ama chu ei ngaisâng si nawh."
"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.","Ama chun ei natnahai phurin, ei lungngainahai khawm a phur ngei a; nisienlakhawm,eini chun lungngaina ivurkhumah, Pathien vuokah, suk- rinumah, ei ngai sih a."
"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu ei bawsietnahai leiin inhliemin a um a, ei khawhlonahai leiin vuok thidukin a um a; ei thlamuongna dinga thu- nunna chu a chungah a tlah a, a vuokna invuolhaia sukdamin ei um tah."
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.,"Ei rêng hin berâm angin ei invâk hmang a, mâni lampui sengah ei pêt a; LALPA chun ama chunga chun ei rênga khawhlona chu ân nghat tah a."
"He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.","Ama chu nêksawr le sukrinumin a um a, nisienlakhawm, ân ngaitlâwm a, a bau khawm a ka nawh; berâmte that dinga an ṭhuoi ang le berâm a hmul vâwtu hmaa to zinga a um ang elin, anih, a bau a ka nawh."
"By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who among them considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?",Nêksâwrna le rorêlna lâk hmangin a um a; a dam ruolpuihai lem chun tuin am mi hring rama inthawka sukbohmanga a um chu ngaituo hrim an ta?

"And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.","Chun, thil nunsetaka thaw ngai loin, a bauah hlêmna hrim hrim um ngai naw sien khawm, a thlân chu mi suolhai kuomah an ruotpêk a, a thi hnung chun mi hausa kuom tieng a um a."
"Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN ama chu vuok thiduk a nuom hrim a nih; a sukna ta ngei a; a hringna chu suol ta dinga thilinhlâna a hmang pha chun, a chithla chu hmu tâng a ta, a dam sûng nihai chu suksei a ta, LALPA dit zâwng chu a kuta hlawtlingin um a tih."
"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.","A hringna sininrim ra chu hmûng a ta, lungawi tâng a tih; ka siehlaw feltak chun a hrietnain mi tamtak chu thiem inchangtir a ta, an khawhlonahai chu phurpêk a tih."
"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.","Chuleiin, ama chu mi lienhai chanvo ang sem vêng ka ta, ama chun râllâk sumhai chu mi hrâthai sem vêng a tih; a hringna chu thi khawp raka a bunthlâk a, bawsetuhai laia tiemsaa a um leiin; nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak suolna chu a phur a, baw- setuhai ta ding chun a ṭawngṭaipêk a."
"Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah.","“Aw ching, nau nei lo, nang, hlimtakin hla sak rawh; nang, nauhase ngai naw, hla sak suok phut la, khêk suok rawh: pasal nei mi nauhai nêk chun khawsâwtnu nau- hai an tam lem sih a,” LALPAIN a tih."
"Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.","I puon in hmun chu zau rawh, i umnahai puon in chung chu keiphar- in um raw se; ret naw rawh, i hruihai chu suksei la, i keimarna hembûrhai chu sukdet rawh."
"For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.","Changtieng le vawitienga khawm în dar lien ding a ni sih a; chuong- chun, i chithlahai chun hnam tin chu roin hluong an ta, khawpui râusan hnungahai chun mîn umtir nâwk an tih."
Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth; and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.,"Ṭi naw, i muolpho âwm si nawh a; beidawng bawk naw, muolphoin i um âwm bawk si nawh a, i tleirâwl lai muolphona chu i theinghil tain, i hmeithaina hmingsietna khawm chu i hriet zing ta âwm si nawh a."
For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.,Nangma siemtu chu i pasal a ni sih a; a hming chu sipaihai LALPA a nih; Israelhai Mi Inthieng chu nang- ma intlantu a ni bawk a nih; ama chu khawvêl po po Pathien tîng an tih.
"For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy God.","Nuhmei mâk, lungrila lungngai- tak, tlangvâl laia nuhmei tah, pei hnung ko nâwk angin LALPAIN a ko che a ni hi, i Pathienin a tih."
For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.,"Mitkhapkâr chau el ka mâk cheh a; nisienlakhawm, lunginsietna nasa- takin ṭhuoi nâwk ka ti che."
"In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer.","Ka lunginsen luotin mitkhapkâr nanga tieng ka hmai ka thup a; nisienlakhawm, kumkhawtluong zai- nêmnain lunginsiet ka ti che, LALPA nangma intlantu chun a tih."
"For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.","Chu chu ka ta dingin Noa tuihai ang kha a ni sih a; “Noa tuihai chun hnuoi chîm tlum nâwk ta naw ni,” tia ṭawng kân khâm ang khan, “I chungah lunginsen nâwk ta naw ning a, kâwk nâwk ta naw bawk ka ti che,” tiin ṭawng kân khâm tah a nih."
"For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.","Tlâng lienhai chu fe hmang an ta, tlâng chînhai chu sawnin um bawk an tih; ka zainêmna ruok hi chu i kuoma inthawkin fe hmang naw nih a, ka remna thuthlung chu sawnin um bawk naw ni, LALPA a lungin- siettu che chun a tih."
"O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.","Aw nang sukrimsik, tuifâwn vawr vawra um, lungmuongna nei lo, ngai ta, i lunghai chu zie mawitak- haiin rem ka ta, i lungphûmhai chu sapphir lunghaiin rem bawk ka tih."
"And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.","I sîp zumhai chu rubi lungin, i kawtkhârhai chu karbankle lungin, i kul po po chu lung mawihaiin siem ka tih."
And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.,"I nauhai po po chu LALPA in- chûktirin um an ta, i nauhai lung- muongna chu nasatak nîng a tih."
"In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.","Felnaa sukdetin um i ta, nêk- sâwrnaa inthawka hlatakah um i tih; i ṭi ta naw ding a nih; thil râpthlâka inthawka hlatakah um bawk i ta; a hnai naw ding che a nih."
"Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.","Ngai ta, an la pung khâwm a ni thei, nisienlakhawm, ka thu ni naw ni; nangma thaw dinga pung khâwm ta- phawt chu nangma leiin tlûng an tih."
"Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.","Ngai ta, kei chun thirsu pûm zâpa a sinthawna ding hriem sut hlaktu chu ka siem a; keima bawkin sukse dingin suksetu ka siem a nih."
"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.","Nangma thawna dinga hriem sut hrim hrim ṭhahnem naw nih a, lei tinrêng thupawia nangma hung khing- tuhai che chu thiemnaw inchangtir i tih.

"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.","Hung ta u, dangchâr taphawthai, tuiahai hin hung ro, tangka nei nawhai khawm hung unla, inchaw unla, fa ro; anih, hung unla, uoin le nênetui tangka pe loin, a man khawm pe loin inchaw ro."
"Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.","Bu ni si loah ieng dinga tangka in sêng am a na?

"Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.","Ngai ta, i hriet naw hnam chu ko i ta, nangma hre ngailo hnam chu i kuomah hung tlân an ta; LALPA i Pathien lei le, Israelhai Mi Inthieng lei chun; ama chun a chawimawi si cheh a."
Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near:,"Hmu awla a um lai hin LALPA chu zawng unla, a hnâi lai hin ko ro;"
"let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.","mi rilo chun a um dân chu bânsan sienla, mi fel naw chun a ngai- tuonahai chu bânsan bawk raw se; LALPA kuomah kîr nâwk raw se; chuongchun, ama chun lo lunginsiet a ta; ei Pathien kuomah kîr nâwk raw se, ama chun a lo ngaidam nasa khawp âwm sih a."
"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.","Ka ngaituohai hi i ngaituohai a ni si nawh a, i um dânhai chu ka um dân a ni bawk nawh, LALPAIN a tih."
"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.","Vân khi hnuoi nêka ân sâng lem angin, ka um dânhai hi i um dânhai nêkin ân sâng lem sih a, ka ngai- tuohai khawm hi i ngaituohai nêkin ân sâng lem a nih."
"For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater;","Ruo le vûr chu vâna inthawkin a sûr hlak a, khitienga khin a kîr nâwk ngai nawh a, hnuoi hi a châwm lem a, thil ân mâwngtirin ân dertir a, bu chi thetu kuoma chun bu chi a pêk a, fatu kuoma chun fâk ding a pêk hlak a."

"Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.","Anni chun zawng chu ni tin el an mi zawng hlak a, ka lampui thuhai hriet chu an inhâwk hlak; feltaka thaw le an Pathien rorêlna bânsan ngai naw hnam angin, ka kuomah rorêlna feltak an mi hni hlak a.

"Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?

"Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.","Ngai ta u, innghirnghona le in- sêlna ding el, rîtlona kuttuma inchum dingin a nih, bu in nghei hlak chu: in râwl hi chungtienga inhriettir tlâk zâwngin chu ni chun bu in nghei ngai nawh."
"Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?","Chuong ang chu bu ngheina ka dit zâwng chûm a nih?

"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?","Mâni bu mi phîngṭâmhai kuoma sem le, rimsi hnawtsuoka umhai mâni ina ṭhuoi hi ni lem lo am a nih?

"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearward.","“Chu pha chun i var chu zîng nisa suok angin hung suok a ta, i damna ding chu hung inder suok vak a tih; i felna chun i hma ṭhuoi a ta; LALPA ropuina chu i hnung dâltu nîng a tih."
"Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;","Chu pha chun ko i ta, chuong- chun, LALPA chun dawn a tih; hang ko i ta, chuongchun, ama chun, ‘Hitaka hin ka um,’ tîng a tih.

"If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:","“Châwlni bawse lo dinga, ka ni inthienga i nuom zâwng thaw lo dinga i kepha chu în nghatkîrtir a, châwlni chu ni lâwmum le LALPA ni inthieng chu inzaum i tih a, mâni lampui hraw loa, i chawimawi chun,"
then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.,"LALPA chunga chun lâwm i ta, leihnuoi hmun insângahai chun inchuongtir ka ti cheh a; i pu Jakob rohluo thilin châwm ka ti che; LALPA bau chun chu chu a hril tah a nih.”"

"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.","An aium rîl puon chu silfênahai hung inchang naw nih a, an thil- thawhai chun inbel bawk naw ni hai; an thilthawhai chu khawhlona thil- thawhai a na, thil nunsetaka thawna chu an kutah a um bawk a."
"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.","An kehai chu thil ṭha naw tieng a tlân hlak a, pawitâwklo thisen insuo dingin an inhmaw hlak; an ngaituo- hai chu khawhlona ngaituonahai a ni hlak a; râusanna le sietna chu an lampuia chun a um hlak."

"For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:","Kan bawsietnahai hi i hmaah a pung ta sih a; kan suolnahai hin a mi hêk hlak a nih: kan bawsietnahai hi kan kuomah a um zing sih a, kan khawhlonahai chu kan hriet a nih:"

"And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.","Chuongchun, rorêlna chun hnungtieng a mîn nghatsan a, felna chun hlatakah a mi ngîrsan tah; thutak chu kawtthlêra chun a tlu zing sih a, indikna hlak chu a lût thei nawh a."
"Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.","Anih, thutak a um ta nawh a; thil ṭha naw bânsantu chu râllâkah ân siem hlak; LALPAIN chu chu a hmuh a, indikna hrim hrim um ta naw chun a suklungni ta nawh a."

"And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.","Chun, felna chu âwmphawah a hâk a, sandamna lukhum a khum a, chun, inthuomnaa chun phubalâkna silfênhai chu ân bel a, zakawfuola chun ṭhahnemngaina a hâk a."

"And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.","“Kei chu hi hi a nih an kuoma ka thuthlung chu: ka thlarau i chunga um le, ka thu i baua ka siehai chun, tuta inthawka chatuon chen khawmin i bau chu suoksan naw ni hai a, i thlahai thla nâwk sâwng bau khawm suoksan bawk naw ni hai,” LALPAIN a tih."

"Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun Israel- haia inthawk chun a lu le a mei, intûm kau le thielkuong ni khat thilah sawk tâwl a tih."
"The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.","Upa le mi inzaumhai chu a lu chu an na, khêl inchûktir hlak zâwl- neihai chu a mei chu an nih."
For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.,"Hieng mihai ṭhuoituhai hin an ṭhuoi suol hlak a nih, an iṭhuoihai chu sukbohmangin an um hlak a nih."
"Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Chuleiin, LALPA chu an tlang- vâlhai chungah lâwm naw nih a, an naufahrahai le hmeithaihai chu lunginsiet bawk naw nih; an rêngin Pathien inzâ naw mi le thil ṭha naw thawtu an ni vawng a, bau po po chun thu teplo a hril seng sih a. Chuong ang lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a la bo chuong si nawh a, a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
"For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.","Rîtlona chu mei angin a chawk dur dur hlak sih a, buor le hlohling- neihai chu a kâng hmang hlak; anih, ramhnuoi thing bitna hmunahai chun a kâng dur dur a, a khu ân tung ngut ngut hlak."
Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.,"Sipaihai LALPA lunginsenna leiin ram chu a kâng siet a, mihai khawm chu meia ti ding thing ang an na; tukhawma mâni unau ngei khawm an hla nawh."
"And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:","Chuongchun, miin an chang- tienga mi inchûng an ta, nisienla- khawm, an phîng la ṭâm ta rawp a ta, an vawitienga mi fâng an ta, nisien- lakhawm, tlai chuong naw ni hai, mi tinin mâni bân taksa fa seng an tih."
"Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Manassehaiin Ephraimhai fâng an ta, Ephraimhaiin Manassehai fâng an tih; chun, an pahni chun Judahai do hmunkhat an tih. Chuong ang lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a bo si nawh a, a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
