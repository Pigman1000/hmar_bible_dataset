"God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,","Pathien inhmaa thlatuhai kuoma bung tamtak le kawng tinrênga zâwlneihaia thu lo hriltu khan,"
"hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds;","hieng ni tâwpa hin eini kuomah a Naupaa chun thu a hril tah. Ama chu iengkim rohluotu dingin a ruot a, amaa bawk chun khawvêlhai chu a siem a."
"who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;","Ama chu a Pathien ropuina var le, a tak angpui ngei leh, ama thil- thawtheina thuah iengkim tungding- tu niin, suolhai a sukthieng hnungin chung tienga Ropuitak changtienga khin a hang ṭhung a."
"having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.",Vântirkohai nêka hming ṭha lem ro a hluo sâwng ang ngeiin anni nêka ropui lem a hung ni ta sih a.
"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him a Father, And he shall be to me a Son?","Vântirko hai laia tu kuom am hi thu hi a hril hlak a? “Nang chu ka Naupa i nih, Vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih,” ti le, “A ta dingin Pa ning ka ta, Ama chu keia ta dingin Naupa ning a tih,” ti hi."
"And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.","Chun, Nau lutir chu khawvêla hin a ṭhuoi lût nâwkin, “Pathien vântirkohai po po khawmin, Ama chibai bûk raw se,” a tih a."
"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels winds, And his ministers a flame of fire:","Chun, vântirko chungchâng thua chun hi hi a hril a nih: “Ama chun a vântirkohai chu, Thliah ân changtir hlak a, A rawngbâwltuhai khawm, Meichawkah ân changtir hlak,” ti hi."
"but of the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.","Naupa chungchâng thua ruok chu hi hi a hril a nih: “Aw Pathien, i lalṭhungpha chu Chatuonin a um ding a nih; Indikna lal hmawl khawm chu, I ram lal hmawl chu a nih."
"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.","Felna chu i ngaina a, Bawsietna chu i theida kha; Chuleiin, Pathien, i Pathien chun, I ruolhai nêk chun, Hlimna hriek a nâl nasa lem che hi,” ti le,"
"And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of thy hands:","“Nang Lalpa, a tîrin, Leilung innghatsan i phûm tah a, Vânhai khawm i kutsuok a na,"
They shall perish; but thou continuest: And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;,"Chuonghai chu la bohmang a ta, Nang ruok chu um sawng ding i nih; Chun, chuonghai po po chu, Silfên angin la hlui a ta,"
"And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up, As a garment, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, And thy years shall not fail.","Puon angin zuol bawk i ta– Silfên ang elin, Chuongchun, hung danglam tâng a ta; Nang ruok chu i pângngai rawp a, I kumhai khawm bo naw ni,” tiin."
"But of which of the angels hath he said at any time, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?","Nisienlakhawm, vântirkohai laia tu chungchâng thu âm hi hi a hril hlak a? “Ka changtieng ṭhung rawh, I hmêlmahai i kepha sirsana, Ka siem hmakhat chun,” ti hi."
"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?","Anni po po chu rawngbâwlna thlarauhai, sandamna rohluotu ding- hai ta dinga rawngbâwl dinga tirsuok an ni naw am a nih?"
"For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.","Dân thu chun thil ṭha hung um dinghai angpui nei loin, a hlim chau a nei leiin, kum tina inthâwina pângngai an inhlân rawphai chun, a hung hnaihai chu iengtika khawm sukfamkim thei si naw ni a."
"Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.","Chuong chu ni naw sien chu a betuhai chu vawi khata sukthieng nghâla umin suolhai inhrietna nei ta naw nihai a, inhlân chu an ma dai ta naw ding am a nih?"
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.,"Nisienlakhawm, chuong inthâwi- naa chun kum tinin suolhai hriet nâwkna a hung um rawp lem a nih."
For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.,Bâwngchalhai le kêlhai thisen chun suolhai sukbo thei ruol a ni si nawh a.
"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me;","Chuongchun, khawvêla a hung lût laiin: “Inthawina le thil inhlân i dit nawh a, Ka ta dingin taksa i mi buotsai pêk lem a;"
In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:,"Pumrâwhmanga inthâwinahaia le, Suol ta dinga inthâwinahaia chun Lâwmna hrim i nei nawh."
"Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me) To do thy will, O God.","Chu phingle chun keiin, ‘Aw Pathien, ngai ta, (Lekhabu zuola chun ka thu ziek a nih), I dit zâwng thaw dingin ka hung,’ ka tih a,” a ta,"
"Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),","A saka khin, “Inthawina dâm, thil inhlân dâm, pumrâwhmanga inthâwina dâm, suol ta dinga in- thâwina dâm i dit nawh a, chuonga chun lâwmna i nei bawk nawh,” a tih a. (Chuonghai chu dân thu anga inhlân a nih)."
"then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.","Chu phingle chun, “Ngai ta, I dit zâwng thaw dingin ka hung,” a lo ti tah a. A pahnina hi ân tungding theina dingin a hmasa chu a sukbo ta a nih."
By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.,"Chu chu dit zâwng chun, Isu Krista taksa vawi khata hlân nghâl lei khan sukthiengin ei um tah."
"And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:","Chun, thiempu tinrêngin kâwla nisa suok tiema rawng bâwlin suolhai iengtik lai khawma sukbo thei naw inthâwina pângngai inhlân rawpin an ngîr hlak;"
"but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;","ama ruok hi chu, chatuona dingin suolhai ta dinga inthâwina ṭum khat chau ân hlân hnungin, Pathien changtieng a hang ṭhung ta lem a."
henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.,"Chu chena inthawk chu, a hmêlmahai a kepha innghatnaa siem an ni hmakhat chu a nghâk zing a."
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.,Thil inhlân ṭum khat chauin sukthieng tahai chu chatuona dingin a sukfamkim ta sih a.
"And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,","Chun, Thlarau Inthieng khawm chun a mîn hriettir bawk a:"
"This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; then saith he,","“Chuong ni hnunga chun, An kuoma thu ka thlung dinghai chu hieng hi a nih, Lalpain a tih, An lungrilah ka thupêkhai sieng ka ta, An lungrilah ziek bawk ka tih,” tia a hril hnung khan;"
And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.,"“An suolhai le an bâwsietnahai Hre zing ta naw ning,” a ti sih a."
"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.","Chuongchun, chuong ang ngai- damna taphawta chun suol ta dingin thil inhlân a um ta naw a nih."
"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,","Chuongchun, unauhai, Isu thi- sen lei chun, Hmun Inthienga khan lût ei huom a;"
"by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;","Puonzâr (a taksa) chu fe thlengin, lam thar le hring a mi hawng pêk tah a;"
and having a great priest over the house of God;,"Chuongchun, Pathien sûnghai chunga Thiempu ropuitak ei nei leiin,"
"let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,","ei lungrila sie le ṭha hrietna faitaka umin, ei taksa khawm tui inthienga sâwpa umin, ringna fam- kim neia lungril indiktak putin hnai ei tiu."
let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:,Inhnîng lovin ei beisei thuring hi pawm tlat ei tiu; thutiemtu chu ring a um sih a.
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;,"Chun, hmangai le thilthawa in- chawktho tuo dingin inngaituo seng ei tiu."
"not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.","Ṭhenkhat thaw dân anga in- khâwm dâm bânsan loin, infui tuo lem ei tiu, ni chu hung hnai deu deua in hrietin infui tuo nâwkzuol sau ro."
"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,","Thutak hrietna famkim chu ei chang hnunga thil ei suksuol ṭâl chun, suolhai dingin inthâwina um ta dêr naw ni a,"
"but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.",rorêlna ṭi lâwkna râpthlâktak ieng amani leh dotuhai kâng hmang dinga lungsenna mei chu um lem tâng a tih.
A man that hath set at nought Moses’ law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses:,"Mosie Dân thu pawisa naw mi chu, hretu pahni pathum amani thuin lainatna ṭhang loin an thi hlak."
"of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?","Pathien Naupa sirde a, thu- thlung thisen ama sukthiengna thil narâna ruota, lunginsietna Thlarau suknuortu chu, chu mi chu ieng anga hremna nasa lem tuor tlâka ruot ni dingin am in ngai a?"
"For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.","“Phuba hrim hrim keia lâk ding a nih, keiin thung ka tih,” ti le “Lalpa chun a mihai ngaituong a tih,” ti nâwktu chu ei hriet si a."
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.,Pathien hring kuta tlûk chu thil râpthlâktak a nih.
"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;","Nisienlakhawm, inhmaa suk- vara in um hnunga tuorna buoi nasatak in tuor lai nihai kha hre nâwk ro:"
"partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.","kawng khata chun hmusit le rinumhai khawm tuorin ennuoma siemin in um a, kawng khata chun chuong anga inhmaa lo umhai kha tuorpuituhai in hung nih."
"For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.","Kawlbunhai chu in lainat a, thil ṭha lem, um sawng bawk ding chu, mâniin in nei ti hrein, in thilneihai lâkpêka in umnaa khawm lâwmtakin in lo tuor tah a."
"Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.","Chuongchun, in ringna lâwm- man pêk nasatak nei ding chu peihâwn naw ro,"
"For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.",Pathien dit zâwng in thaw hnungin thiltiem chu in hmu theina dingin selna in ngai a nih.
"For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.","“Sawt nawtê hnungah, A hung ding chu a hung ding a ni sih a. Sâwt riel ta naw nih."
"But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.","Nisienlakhawm, ka mi fel chu Ringnain hring a tih; A hnungtawl ruok chun, Ka lungrilin amaa chun lâwmna hrim nei naw ni,”"
But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.,"Nisienlakhawm, eini chu bo- hmang dinga hnungtawl pâwla mi ei ni nawh a, hringna humhim dinga ringna nei pâwla mi ei ni lem."
"Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.","Chun, ringna hi thil beiseihai um ngeia hrietna, thil hmu lohai hrietchiengna a nih."
For therein the elders had witness borne to them.,Chutaka chun upahai khan inpâk an hlaw sih a.
"By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.","Ringnain khawvêlhai hi Pathien thua siem fel diem a ni ta ti ei hriet, chuongchun, thil hmu theihai hi thil inlang theihaia siem a ni nawh."
"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.","Ringnain Abel chun Kaina nêkin inthâwina ṭha lem Pathien kuomah ân hlân a, chu lei chun mi fel a nih ti inhriettirna a hlaw a, Pathienin a thilpêkhai kawnga chun thu ân hriettir a, chun, chu ringna lei chun ama chun thi ta hnungin thu a la hril ta rawp a nih."
"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:","Ringnain Enok kha thina hre lo dinga lâk hmangin a lo um a. Chun, Pathienin a lâk hmang ta leiin hmu thei a ni ta nawh a. Lâk hmanga a um hmain Pathien lâwm zâwng mi a ni ti inhriettir a ni ta hrim a."
"and without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing unto him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.","Nisienlakhawm, ringna naw chun ama lâwm zâwng mi ni ruol a ni nawh; Pathien kuoma hung chun ama chu a um ti le, a zawngtuhai kuomah lâwmman pe hmang a nih, ti ring ding a nih."
"By faith Noah, being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.","Ringnain Noa chu thil la hung inlang lohai kawng thuah Pathien hrila lo umin Pathien ṭidêkin, ama sûngkuo sandamna dingin lawng a tuk a; chu chun khawvêl chu thiemnaw ân changtir tah a, ringna leia felna um ro chu hluotu a lo ni tah a."
"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.","Ringnain Abraham chu koa a um lai khan, a rohluo ding hmuna lût dingin fe suok thu chu a pawm tah a; chun, a fena ding tieng khawm hre loin a fe suok tah a."
"By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:","Ringnain ram tiema khan mi rama châm ang elin a lo châm ta zing a, thutiem hmunkhat, ro a ihluopui ding Isak le Jakob hai angin puon inahai a lo um a;"
"for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.","khuo, lungphûmhai nei mi, Pathien ibâwl le siem chu a nghâk zing leiin."
"By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:","Ringnain Sara ngei khawmin, a tiemtu chu ringuma a ruot leiin tar ta hnungin chi pai theina a hmuh a."
"wherefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable.","Chuongchun, pasal pakhat, mi- thi ang el ni tahnunga inthawkin, vâna arasihai anga tam, tuisuoriet panga phaiphin anga tiem sêng naw an hung suok tah a."
"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.","Chuong po po chu ringna neiin an thi tah a, thiltiemhai chu chang loin; nisienlakhawm, chuong chu hlataka inthawka hmuin chibai an lo bûk tah a, hnuoia hin mikhuol le khuolfe el an ni ti an inhriettir ta bawk a."
For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.,Chuong ang thu hriltuhai chun anni ram ding an zawng ti a suklang sih a.
"And if indeed they had been mindful of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.","Chun, an suokna ram chu lung- kham hai sien chu fena remchâng an hmu ngei ta ding a nih."
"But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu ram ṭha nâwkzuol châk an na, chu chu vâna um a nih. Chuongchun, Pathienin an Pathien tia um chu ân zak nawh, an ta dingin khuo chen a lo buotsaipêk ta sih a."
"By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;","Ringnain Abraham chu fiea a um khan Isak ân hlân a; anih, thutiemhai lâwmtaka changtu chun, a naupa khât nei sun chu ân hlân a,"
"even he to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:","“Isaka hin i thlahai tîng an tih,” a ti ang ngei khan;"
"accounting that God is able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back.",Pathienin mithi laia inthawkin a keitho thei ti hrein chutaka chun thi ta hnung keitho angin a hmu nâwk ta ngei bawk a.
"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.",Ringnain Isak chun thil la hung tlung dinghai thuah Jakob le Esau mal a sâwmpêk a.
"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.","Ringnain Jakob chun, a thi ding lai khan, Josef nauhai chu mal a sâwm ve ve a; a hmawl hmawr ring ringsanin Pathien a biek bawk a."
"By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.","Ringnain Josef chun, a thi a hung hnai khan, Israel thlahai suok ding thu a hril a, a ruhai kawng thuah thu a pêk bawk a."
"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.","Ringnain Mosie a pieng lai khan, nautê hmêlṭha tak a ni leiin, thla thum sûng a nu le pa thup- hmangin a um a; lal thupêk khawm an ṭi nawh."
"By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;","Ringnain Mosie chun, a hung puitling hnung khan, Pharao naunu naupaa inbûk chu a nuom nawh a."
"choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;",Sâwt nawtê kâr suol inhawina hlimpui nêk chun Pathien mihai le suknawmnat tuor a thlang ta lem a;
accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.,"Krista an hmusitna chu Aigupta ram rohai nêk chun sum ropui lemah a ruot a, lâwmman pêk ding chu a thlîr hlak leiin."
"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.","Ringnain lal lunginsenna chu ṭi loin Aigupta ram a mâksan a, hmu thei naw Pathien chu a hmu leiin a tuor fan fan a nih."
"By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.","Ringnain Fekân Ruoiṭhe le thisen the kha a siem a, nau lutir sukbohmangtu chun anni a tâwk nâwna dingin."
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.,"Ringnain khawmuola fe angin Tuisuoriet Sena khan an fe kai a; Aiguptahaiin chu chu thaw an tum ve a, lem zoin an um tah a."
"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.",Ringnain Jeriko kul kha ni sari an inhuol hnungin a chim tah a.
"By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.","Ringnain Rahab nawchizawr kha awi nawhai lai a bohmang ve ta nawh a, enthlatuhai chu tlangtaka a lâwm leiin."
"And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:","Chun, ieng am la hril rawp ka ta? Gideon thu dâm, Barak thu dâm, Samson thu dâm, Jephtha thu dâm, David thu dâm, Samuel thu dâm, zâwlneihai thu dâm hril lang hunin mi dai si naw nih a."
"who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,","Chuonghai chun ringnain ram- hai an lâk a, thil fel an thawh a, thutiemhai an chang a, sakeibaknei khâkhai an sukchîp a, mei thilthaw- theina an sukmit a, kâwlhnâm ngei chenin an pumpel a."
"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.","Hrât nawnaa inthawka hrâttak- a siemin an um a, indonaa chun mi hrât khawkhêng an lo na, hnam dang indo pâwlhai an intlânsiettir a."
"Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:","Nuhmeihaiin an mithihai tho nâwk an hmuh a, mi danghai khawm sawisakin an um a, thonâwkna ṭha nâwkzuol an chang theina dingin san suok an nuom nawh."
"and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:","Mi dang khawmin suknawmnat le vuokhai an tuor a, anih, chu naw khawm chu kawlbun le intângna ina khum dâm an tuok bawk a,"
"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated","lunga dêngin an um a, thingâtnaa ât bawngin an um a, thlêmna an tuok a, kâwlhnâma sât hlumin an um a, berâm vun le kêl vun silin an invai a; rimsitakin, rinumtakin, suknawmnatin an um a."
"(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.","Chuonghai ta ding chun khawvêl hi umna tlâk a ni nawh. Thlalêra dâm, tlânga dâm, pûka dâm, khura dâm an invâk an invâk hlak a."
"And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,","Chun chuonghai po po chun an ringna leiin inpâk an lo hlawh a, thiltiem chu an chang nawh."
"God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.","Eini ṭhang lova, anni chu suk- famkima an um nawna dingin Pathienin eini kawng thuah thil ieng amanih ṭha nâwkzuol a buotsai ta leiin."
"Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,","Chuongchun, chuong ang lâwma tam, mi thlîrtuhai in- huol vêla ei um leiin, a mi sukhnawk taphawt le suol einia kawp tlat chu sie thla vêng ei ta, ei hmaa intlânsiekna uma hin seltakin tlân pei ei tiu."
"looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.","Isu ei ringna siemtu le suk- famkimtu tieng chu en zingin; ama chun a hmaa hlimna um lei chun muolphona chu ngainêpin, kraws chu a tuor a, Pathien lalṭhungpha changtieng khin a hang ṭhung tah a."
"For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.","In hung sâwl a, in thlarau tieng in hung chau nawna dingin, misuol- hai theidana nasatak tuormuolsuotu ngei chu ngaituo ro."
"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:","Suol doin thisen suok khawpin in la ṭhang nawh a,"
"and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;","infuina thu, nauhai kâwk anga kâwkna cheu kha in lo theinghil tah a ni maw? “Ka nau, Lalpa thununna chu ngainêp naw la, A kâwka i umin inthlada bawk naw rawh;"
"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.","Lalpa chun a hmangai chu a thunun hlak a, Nau a ilâwm taphawt chu a vuok hlak i sawnnaw,” ti hi."
It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not?,In tuor hi nangni thununna ding a nih; nauhai chunga thaw angin Pathienin in chungah a thaw a ni hi; pa thunun naw nau tû am a um hlak a.
"But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.","Nau po po ihlaw hlak thununna chu hlaw loa in um chun, nau tak ni loin, sâwn in ni, a ni ding a nih."
"Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?","Chu naw khawm chu a mi thunun dingin ei taksa pahai ei nei kha, chuonghai chu ei inza sih a; chu nêka nasa chun, ei hringna dingin, thlarauhai Pa thu thuin ei um naw ding am a nih?"
"For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.","Anni chun ni sâwt nawtê ṭha an ti ang peiin an mi thunun ngei luoh a, Ama ruok chun ân thiengna chu ei chang ve theina dingin, ei ṭhatna dingin a mi thunun lem a nih."
"All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, even the fruit of righteousness.","Chun, thununna hrim hrim hi tuor lai chun lâwmumin ân lang nawh a, thlasietthlâkin ân lang lem hlak, tuor hnung ruok chun chutaka sawizawia umhai ta ding chun felna ra thlamuongumtak chu ân suopêk hlak."
"Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;","Chuongchun, kut kaithlahai chu dawm kâng unla, khûp zawihai chu sukhrât ro;"
"and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.","chun, kebai chu sukpelsawl loa, sukdama a um lemna dingin, in kehai ta dingin lampui tlûnhai siem ro."
"Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:","Mi po po le inremna le inthieng- na hnawt ro, chu inthiengna naw chun tukhawmin Lalpa hmu naw ni hai."
"looking carefully lest there be any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby the many be defiled;","Nguntakin en ro, chuong naw chun, Pathien lunginsietna tling zo naw mi tû amanih um a ta, khâkna zung ieng amanih hung indera suk- buoi cheuin, chu chun mi tamtak chu sukthieng loin um an ta,"
"lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.","indit hmang amanih, Esau anga Pathien inza naw mi amanih um rawi an tih. Ama chun a nau lutir nina chu bu vawikhat fâkin a zawr a."
"For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind in his father, though he sought it diligently with tears.","Chu hnunga chun malsâwmna ro chu hluo chu nuom hlein, mitthli tla pumin ṭhahnemngaitakin zawng sien khawm, simna remchâng a hmu tâk naw leiin peiin a um tah ti in hriet sih a."
"For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,","Nangni chu tlâng tâwk thei, meia kâng dâm, sûm dum dâm, inthim dâm, thlipui dâm umna kha tlung in ni si nawh a;"
"and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;","tawtawrâwt inrîkna dâm, thu hril ri umna dâm kha, chu ri hretuhai chun thu dang hrim an kuoma hril ta lo dingin an ngên a,"
"for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;","“Sa chen khawmin tlâng chu tâwk sienla, lunga dêng hlumin a um ding a nih,” ti thupêk kha an tuor thei ta si nawh a;"
"and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:","an thil hmu khawm chu ṭi a um êm a, chuongchun, Mosiein, “Ka ṭiin kân thin nasa bêk bêk a,” a ti kha."
"but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,","Zion tlâng dâm, Pathien hring khuo, vân Jerusalem dâm, tiem sêng nawhai vântirko inkhâwmpui dâm,"
"to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,","nau lutîr vâna hming chuong kohran kuom dâm, Pathien, mi po po ngaituotu kuom dâm, mi fel sukṭhat famkimhai thlarau kuom dâm,"
"and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel.","Isu thuthlung thar palai kuom dâm, thisen the, Abel thisen nêka ṭha lem hriltu kuom dâm tlung in ni lem."
"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned them on earth, much more shall not we escape who turn away from him that warneth from heaven:","Thu hriltu chu lo dit naw rawi in tih, fimkhur ro. Hnuoia anni kâwk hmasatu kha an dit naw hmana, hremna an pumpel si naw chun, eini vâna inthawka mi kâwktu nghatsan- tuhai hin pumpel naw nâwkzuol ei tih."
"whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.","Chu lai chun a râwl chun hnuoi hi a sukhnîng a, nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu, “Vawi khat chu hnuoi chau ni loin, vân khawm la sukhnîng ka tih,” tiin a tiem ta lem a."
"And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.","Chun, “Vawi khat la sukhnîng nâwk ka tih,” ti hin thil inhnîng nawhai chu a um zing theina dingin thil hung inhnînghai chu thil siemhai ang elin sawn hmangin a um ding a nih ti ân hriettir a."
"Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:","Chuongchun, ram sukhnîng ruol lo ei chang leiin, lâwmtakin um ei tiu, chu zâra chun inza le ṭidêk pumin Pathien lâwm zâwngin rawng ei bâwl thei ding a nih;"
for our God is a consuming fire.,ei Pathien hi mi kâng bohmang mei a ni sih a.
Let love of the brethren continue.,Unau inhmangaina hi um pei raw se.
Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.,Mikhuolhai chunga hmangai in- suo theinghil naw ro; chuong anga thawin mi ṭhenkhatin hre loin vân- tirkohai an lo intlungtir sih a.
"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are ill-treated, as being yourselves also in the body.",Intânghai chu anni le khuopa um ve angin hre zing unla; rinum tuorhai chu taksaa um ve bawk in ni leiin hre zing ro.
"Let marriage be had in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.","Mi po po lai innei hi inzatlâkin um sienla, khum khawm sukpawrche loin um raw se; indithai le uirehai chu Pathienin a ngaituo ding a ni sih a."
"Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.","In lungril putzie chu tangka ngainatna ṭhang naw ni raw se, in thil nei sunhaia chun lungawi ro; ama ngeiin, “Iengtika khawm thlâthlam naw tawp ka ti cheh a, mâksan ngai naw bawk ka ti che,” a ti sih a."
"So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me?","Chuongchun, huoitakin; “Lalpa chu a mi ṭhangpuitu a nih, Ṭi naw ning; Mihriemin ieng am mi law thei an ta?” ei ti hlak a nih."
"Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.","In hotu, Pathien thu lo hriltuhai cheu chu, hre zing unla, an um dâna thil suok chu ngaituoin an ring dân inchûk ro."
"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day, yea and for ever.","Isu Krista chu zâni leh, vawisûn leh kumkhuo khawmin a pângngaiin um rawp a tih."
"Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.","Inchûktirna tinrêng le inchûk- tirna maktak lên hmangin um naw ro; lungril hi lunginsietnaa sukdet chu a ṭha sih a, fâk dinghaia sukdeta um loin, chuong ang kawng lungkhamhai chun chuonga chun ṭhathnemna an hmu chuong nawh."
"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.","Eini chun mâichâm ei nei a, chutaka chun biekbûk rawngbâwl- tuhai chun an fâk ding a ni nawh."
"For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp.","Ran, a thisen Thiempu Laltakin Hmun Inthienga suol ta dinga inhlân dinga a lûtpui hlak ruonghai khawhnâwmah an raw hlak sih a."
"Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.","Chuongchun, Isu khawmin ama thisen ngeia mihai a sukthieng theina dingin, kul kawtkhâr puotieng chun a lo tuor tah a."
"Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.","Chuongchun, ama an hmusitna chu phurin khawhnâwmah a kuom tieng fe suok vêng ei tiu."
"For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come.","Hitaka hin khaw hmun hlun ei nei si nawh a, khuo la hung um ding chu ei zawng lem a nih."
"Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.","Chuongchun, ama zâra chun inpâka inthawina hi Pathien kuomah inhlân rawp ei tiu; chu chu a hming ṭanna hmûr rahai chu a nih."
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.,"Nisienlakhawm, thil sukṭhat le tiktlai hi theinghil naw ro; chuong ang inthawina chunga chun Pathien a lungni bêk bêk sih a."
"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you.","In hotuhai thu awi unla, an thu thuin um ro; chanchin hril ding an ni leiin, lungngai puma hril loa, hlim puma an hril theina dingin, in thlarau an vêng pêk hlak cheu a nih; lungngai puma hril chu in ta dingin a pawi ding a ni sih a."
"Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.","Kan ta dingin mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro, iengkimah feltaka um tumin, sie le ṭha hrietna inthiengtak kan nei ti indiktakin kan inhriet sih a."
"And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.","Chun, in kuoma inhmaw deua tir nâwka ka um theina dingin, chu chu thaw dingin ka ngên nâwkzuol sau cheu a nih."
"Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus,","Chun, berâm Vêngtu ropuitak, ei Lalpa Isu chu, chatuona thu- thlungna thisen zâra mithi laia inthawka ṭhuoi suok nâwktu inrem- na Pathien khan,"
"make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.","a mithmua a lâwm zâwng ang taphawt Isu Krista zârah keinia thâwin, a dit zâwng thaw dingin thil ṭha tinrêng kawngah sukfamkim raw se cheu; Isu Krista kuoma chun ropuina chatuonin um raw se. Amen."
"But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words.","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, ka ngên cheu, infuina thu hi ngai thei hrâm ro; in kuomah thu tlâwmtê ka ziek sih a."
"Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.","Ei unaupa Timothe kha an insuoktir tah ti lo hre ve ro, a hung inhma deu chun, ama leh hung hmûng kan ti cheu."
"Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.",In hotuhai po po le mi in- thienghai po po kha chibai mi bûkpêk ro. Itali rama mihai hin chibai an bûk cheu.
Grace be with you all. Amen.,In rênga kuomah lunginsietna um raw se. Amen.
"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away from them.","Chuleiin, naa ei ihriethai kha ṭhahnemngaitakin ei pawisa nâwkzuol ding a nih, chuong naw chun, intawl hmang hlau rawi ei tih."
"For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;","Vântirkohai hmanga thu hril hman kha a lo det a, bâwsietna le thuâwi nawna tinrênghai chun thungna feltak a hmu pei si chun,"
"how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;","hieng ang lâwma sandamna ropui hi inthlathlam inla, iengtin am tlân suok thei hlak ei ta? Chu Sandamna thu chu Lalpa hmanga a tîra hril a ni tah a, a hretuhai chun an mi sukdet pêk pei a."
"God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.","Pathien khawmin inchiknahai le thilmakhai le, thilthawtheina tin- rênghai le, ama dit zâwng ang peia Thlarau Inthieng thil semhai le chun, anni chu a hrietpui a."
"For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.","Khawvêl la hung um ding, a chanchin ei hril chu vântirkohai hnuoia chu a sie nawh,"
"But one hath somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?","Nisienlakhawm, mi tu amani chun khâwlai âm ani chu hieng thu hi inhriettirin a hril ta lem a: “Mihriem hi ieng am a nih a, i hriet zing hlak a na? Mihriem naupa khawm hi ieng am a nih a, i kan hlak a na?"
"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and honor, And didst set him over the works of thy hands:","Ama chu vântirkohai nêka inhnuoiin i siem hrih a, Ropuina le chawimawina în khumtir a, I kutsuok chungahai chun hotuah i siem bawk a;"
"Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.","“A ke hnuoiah iengkim i sieh a,” tiin. Chuongchun, a hnuoiah iengkim a sie leiin a hnuoia sie naw ieng- khawm a nei nawh. Amiruokchu, tuhin chu iengkim a hnuoiah umin ei la hmu hri nawh."
"But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every man.","Nisienlakhawm, Isu vântirkohai nêka inhnuoia siema la um hri chu thina tuor leia ropuina le chawi- mawina inkhumtira umin ei hmu ta lem a nih; Pathien lunginsietna leia thîna chu mi tin ân tempêkna dingin."
"For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.","A ta dinga iengkim uma, a zâra iengkim um bawk ta ding chun, nau tamtak ropuinaa a ṭhuoi lût chun, an sandamna siemtu kha tuornahai leiin sukfamkim chu a âwm hrim sih a."
"For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,","A sukthiengtu le a isukthieng- hai chu an rêngin Mi pakhata suok an ni sih a; chuleiin, ama chun anni rawi chu “Unauhai,” ti ân zak nawh a:"
"saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.","“Ka unauhai lai i hming hril ka ta, Um khâwmhai laia chun, Hla sakin inpâk ka ti che,” tiin."
"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.","Chun, “Amaah ka ringna innghat ka tih,” a ti nâwk a. Chun, “En ta u, kei le, Pathien mi pêk naupanghai hi,” a ti nâwk bawk a."
"Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;","Chuongchun, naupanghai hi tisa le thisen changtuhai an ni tâwl leiin, ama ngei khawmin chuong bawk chu a chang ve tah a; thînain thîna thuneitu (chu chu Diebol a nih), a sukbohmang theina ding le,"
and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.,thîna ṭi leia dam sûnga suoka um po pohai chu a sansuok theina dingin.
"For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.","A iṭhangpui hlakhai chu vântir- kohai an ni dêr si nawh a, Abraham thlahai an nih a iṭhangpui hlak chu."
"Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.","Chuongchun, mihai ta dingin suol thuphachawina siempêk dingin, Pathien tieng thilhaia chun, Thiem- pu Laltak, mi lâinatthei le ringum tak a ni theina dingin, iengkima a unauhai anga hung um chu a ṭûl hrim a nih."
"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.","Ama ngei chun thlêmna tuokin a lo tuor ta leiin, thlêmna tuokhai chu a ṭhangpui thei a nih."
"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;","Chuongchun, unau inthieng vân kona chang vehai, ei thuringa Tirko le Thiempu Laltak, Isu chu ngaituo ro;"
"who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.","Pathien sûnghai po po laiah Mosie ring a um ang bawk khan, ama chu a ruottu kuoma chun ring a um a nih."
"For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.","Sûng khata a puipa chu a sûnghai nêkin an chawimawi ang ngeiin, ama chu Mosie nêkin ropui nâwk zuolna hmu tlâka ruot a ni sih a."
For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.,"Sûng tin hin a puipa tu amanih bêk an nei seng hlak sih a, iengkima a puipa ruok chu Pathien a nih."
"And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;","Chun, chu hnunga thu la hril dinghai inhriettirna dingin, Mosie chu Pathien sûnghai po po laia rawngbâwltua chun ring a um ngei a;"
"but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.","Krista ruok chu Pathien sûnghai chungah Naupaah ring a um a nih. A sûnghai chu eini hi ei nih, a tâwp chenin ei huoina le, ei beiseina suongum hi dettaka ei chel phawt chun."
"Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,","Chuongchun, Thlarau Inthieng hril ang bawkin:— “Vawisûn hin a râwl in hriet chun,"
"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,","Thlalêra thlêmna nia, An suknuor lai ang khan, In lungril sukngar naw ro;"
"Where your fathers tried me by proving me, And saw my works forty years.","Chutaka chun in thlâtuhai chun An mi fiein an mi thlêm a, Kum sâwmli sûnga Ka thilthawhai an hmuh a;"
"Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;","Chuongchun, chu thlâhai chunga chun ka lungni nawh a, ‘An lungrilin an ngai suol rawp hlak a, Ka lampuihai khawm an hriet nawh,’ ka tih a,"
"As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.","Ka lungsena kân khâm ang khan, Ka châwlnaa chun lût naw nihai,” tiin."
"Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:","Unauhai, fimkhur ro, chuong naw chun, Pathien hring chu bânsan dingin nangni laiah tu sûnga khawm awi nawna lungril suol hung um rawi a tih."
"but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:","“Vawisûn,” an ti sûng hin ni tinin infui tuo lem ro; chuong naw chun, nangni laia mi tûkhawm hi suol hlêmnaa sukngarin um rawi in tih."
"for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:","Krista changtuhai ei lo ni ta sih a, ei ring san phutna kha a tâwp chena dettaka ei chel tlat phawt chun,"
"while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.","“Vawisûn hin a râwl in hriet chun, An suknuor lai ang khan, In lungril sukngar naw ro,” an ti sûng po hin."
"For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?","Anleh, tuhai am an na hre zing sia suknuor kha? Aigupta rama inthawka Mosie ṭhuoia suok po pohai kha an ni naw am a nih?"
"And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?","Chun, tuhai chung âm a na kum sâwmli sûng a lungni naw kha? Suksuoltu, an ruong thlalêra tlu tahai chunga khan a ni naw am a nih?"
"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?","Chun, thuawi nawhai kuoma chau naw chun tu kuom âm a châwlnaa lût naw dingin inkhâmin a tiem a?"
And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.,"Chuongchun, ring nâwna leiin an lût thei ta nawh ti ei hriet a nih."
"Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.","Chuleiin, ṭîng ei tiu, chuong naw chun, a châwlnaa lûtna thutiema la umin, nangni laiah tûkhawm tling naw angin lo um hlau rawi in tih."
"For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.","An kuoma hril a ni ang bawk khan Chanchin Ṭha chu ei kuoma hril a ni ngei sih a; nisienlakhawm, an thu ngai chun anni a sukṭhahnem si nawh a, ngaitu taktakhai leh ringnaa zawmin an um naw leiin."
"For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.","Eini ring tahai hi chu châwlnaa chun ei lût zing a nih. “Ka lungsena kân khâm ang khan, Ka châwlnaa chun lût naw ni hai,” a ti ang khan, leilung insieng tira sinhai chu thaw zo ni ta sien khawm."
"For he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;","Khâwlai hmuna manih ni sari ni thu hieng ang hin a hril a nih, “Chun, ni sari nia chun Pathienin a sinthaw po po a châwl san tah a,” tiin,"
"and in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest.","Chun hi hmuna hin, “Ka châwlnaa chun lût naw ni hai,” a ti nâwk a."
"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,","Chuongchun, ṭhenkhat chu châwlnaa chun an la lût ding thu a um leiin le, inhmaa Chanchin Ṭha hril dawngtuhai chu awi naw leia an lût ta naw leiin,"
"he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.","sâwttak hnung khan David chun, “Vawisûn hin,” tiin ni ieng amanih a ruot nawn nâwk a nih, “Vawisûn hin a râwl in hriet chun, In lungril sukngar naw ro,” tia a hmaa ka hril ang khan."
"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.","Josua chun anni chu ân châwltir ta si chun, chu hnunga chun ni dang thu chu hril naw ni."
There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.,"Chuongchun, Pathien mihai ta ding chun Châwlnia châwlna a la um ta rawp a."
"For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.","A châwlnaa lût ta chu, Pathienin ama sinthawhai a châwl san ang khan ama khawm chun a sinthawhai a châwl san ve tah a."
"Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.","Chuongchun, tûkhawm chu thuawi nawna leia an tlûk anga ei tlûk nâwna dingin, chu châwlnaa lût ding chun ṭhahnem ngai ei tiu."
"For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.","Pathien thu hi a hring a, thil a thaw thei a, kâwlhnâm ngeituo ieng ang nêk khawmin a ngei a, hringna le thlarau, rulechâng le thlin kawi dar khawp hielin a sun thei a, lungrila ngaituo le tumhai hi a hriet nghâl thei a nih."
And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.,Thil siem ama mithmua inlang naw hrim hrim a um nawh. Ei chanchin ei intlunna ding mithmua chun iengkim saruok le inhawng sain a um lem a nih.
"Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.","Chuongchun, vânahai fe thleng tah, Thiempu Laltak ropuitak, Isu Pathien Naupa chu ei nei leiin, ei thuring hi pawm tlat ei tiu."
"For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.","Thiempu Laltak ei hrât nawzie inhrietnahai mi hrietpui phâk naw nei ei ni si nawh a. Eini anga kawng tinrênga thlêmna tuok tah, suol ruok chu suol naw nei ei ni lem."
"Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.","Chuongchun, zângaina ei hmu theina ding le, ṭhangpui ei ngai phaa ṭhangpuina lunginsietna chu ei hmu theina dingin lunginsietna lalṭhung- pha chu huoitakin hnai ei tiu."
"For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:","Thiempu Laltak taphawt, suolna- hai leia thilpêk le inthâwina ân hlân kawp theina dingin, mihriem laia inthawka lâk tuma lo umin, Pathien tieng thilhaia chun mihriem- hai ta dingin ruot an ni hlak sih a."
"who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;","Chuonghai chun iengkhawm hre nawhai le lampui inhmanghai chungah zai an daw thei hlak a nih, anni ngei khawm hrât nawna inhuol vêla an um bawk leiin."
"and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.","Chun, chu lei chun, mihai ta dinga an inhlânpêk angin, anni ta ding ngei khawmin suolhai leiin in- hlân ve naw thei an ni nawh."
"And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.","Chun, tûkhawmin chu chawi- mawina chu mâni ta dingin an inbel ngai nawh. Aron anga Pathien iko an ni naw chun."
"So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee:","Chuong ang bawkin Krista khawm chu Thiempu Laltaka siem dingin mâni ân sukropui nawh a, “Nang chu ka Naupa i na, Vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih,” tia hriltu khan a sukropui ta lem a nih;"
"as he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.","“Nang chu Melkizedek um dân anga Chatuon Thiempu i nih,” tia hmun danga a hril ang khan."
"Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,","Ama chun a tisa put lai nihaia khan thinaa inthawka ama sandam theitu kuoma khan nasataka khêk le mitthli tla puma ṭawngṭainahai le hninahai ân hlân a, a ṭi dêk leiin ngaiin a um a,"
"though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;",Naupa rau ni sienla khawm a thil tuorhaia chun thu âwi ân chûk tah a nih;
"and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;","chuongchun, sukṭhat famkima hung umin a thu awi po pohai ta dingin chatuona sandamna bulpui a hung ni tah a,"
named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.,Melkizedek um dân anga Thiempu Laltakah Pathienin ân bûk tah a.
"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.","Chu mi chanchina chun hril ding tamtak kan nei a, hrilfie khawm ân tak, in na a lo sêt ta leiin."
"For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.","A hun ngaituo chun inchûktirtu ni rau ta âwm in nia chu, Pathien thu inchûktirna bulhai chu inchûktir in ngai nâwk tah a; bu rum ni loa, nênetui la ngai mi ang in hung ni nâwk ta hi."
For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.,"Nênetui ring taphawt chun felna thua chun hrietna an nei nawh a, nautê an la ni leiin."
"But solid food is for fullgrown men, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.","Bu rum ruok chu puitlinghai ta dingin a nih, chuonghai chun asie aṭha hrefie dingin an hriettheina chu hmangin an sâwizawi tah."
"Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,","Chuongchun, Krista thu bul hril ta loin puitling tieng pan ei tiu; lungphûm chu phûm nâwk ta loin– simna dâm, Pathien tienga ringna dâm,"
"of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.","baptismahai le, kut innghat le, mithi thonâwkna le, chatuona rorêl- na kawng thu inchûktirna lungphûm chu."
"And this will we do, if God permit.",Pathienin rem a ti chun chu chu thaw ngei ei tih.
"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,","Chun, vawikhat lungril sukvara, vân thilpêk intema, Thlarau Inthieng inchangtira,"
"and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,","Pathien thu ṭha le hun la hung um dinga thilthawtheina intem ta zeta,"
"and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.","tlûksanhai kawng thu chu — chuong mihai chu an simna dingin siem thar nâwk ruol an ni nawh, Pathien Naupa chu anni ta dinga hemde nâwka sukmuolpho an ni leiin."
"For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:","Hnuoi, a chunga ruotui tla rawp lo dâwn taa, thloa a umna sanhai ta dinga thlai fâk tlâk hung insuotu chun, Pathiena inthawkin malsâwm- na a hmu hlak a nih."
"but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.","Amiruokchu, hlohlingnei le buor- hai ân suo chun mâkin a hung um a, ṭawngsephur hielin a um hlak a, a tâwpa chun raw a tuok hlak."
"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:","Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, chuong ang chun hril inlang khawm, nangni chun, thil ṭha lem sandamnaa ṭhang thilhai chu in thaw kan ring tlat cheu a nih."
"for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.","In sin thaw le a hming leia hmangaina in inlangtir, mi inthieng- hai rawng in ibâwl, tu chen khawma in ila bâwl rawp chu theinghil dingin Pathien chu mi fel naw a ni si nawh a."
And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:,"Chun, in beiseina chu a fam- kima hmu dingin a tâwp chenin in ṭhahnemngaina pângngai insuo pei unla kan ti bêk bêk a nih."
"that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.","Chuongchun, inthlada naw ti niu a, ringna le nghâk peina leia thutiemhai ro hluotahai inchûk tuhai ni lem in tih."
"For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,","Pathienin Abraham kuoma thu a hung tiem lai khan, ama nêka ropui lem sâlin ân khâm thei naw leiin ama le ama insâlin,"
"saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.","“Matheiloin, mal sâwm ngei ngei ka ti che a, pung khawm suk pung pêk ngei ngei ka ti che,” tiin ân khâm tah a."
"And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.","Chuongchun, seltaka a tuor suok hnungin thiltiem chu a hmu ta ngei a."
For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.,"Mihriem hin anni nêka ropui lem sâlin an inkhâm hlak a nih, an insêlna tinrênga khawm sukdetna dingin inkhâm hi suktâwpna a ni hlak a."
"Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;","Chuongchun, Pathienin thu- tiem rohluo dinghai kuoma chun a rêl danglam thei nawzie, nasa nâwk zuola inentir nuomin inkhâmin a sukdet a;"
"that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:","Pathien inkhêl ruol a ni nawna, thil danglam thei naw pahni leiin, eini, insanhimna dinga ei hmaa beiseina um chel dinga tlânhai in- fuina nasatak ei nei theina dingin."
"which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;","Chu beiseina chu hringnaa thîr- chakaiah ei nei a, ringum le dettak a nih, puonzâr sûnga mia khawm chun a lût a,"
"whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.","chutaka chun Isu, Melkizedek um dân anga chatuon Thiempu Laltak lo ni tain, ei hmaṭhuoitu dingin a lût tah a."
"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","Chu Melkizedek chu Salem lal, Pathien Chunghnungtak Thiem- pu, Abraham lalhai thata a hung tieng lo tuoka malsâwmtu a nih."
"to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;","Ama chu Abrahamin iengkim sâwma pakhat a pêk a. A hming umzie chu a hmasatakah Felna Lal a na, a dawtah Salem lal a ni bawk a, chu chu Remna Lal tina a nih."
"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.","Ama chu pa nei loin, nu nei loin, chi thlatuhai chanchin nei loin, um ṭanna nei loin, hring tâwp khawm nei chuong loin, Pathien Naupa anga siema umin, Thiempuah a um zing a nih."
"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.","Chuongchun, chi thlatu Abra- hamin a râllâk ṭha po sâwma pakhat a ipêk chu, chu mihriem ropuizie chu ngaituo ta u."
"And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:","Levi thlahai laia thiempu sin chang taphawt chun Dân thu angin mihai kuoma inthawkin sâwma pakhat lâkna thu an hmu ngei a nih, chu chu an unauhaia inthawkin a nih; chuonghai chu Abraham ṭhalbea insieng ni hai sien khawm;"
"but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.","amiruokchu, anni laia thlatuhai sui sa ve naw khan Abrahama inthawk- in sâwma pakhat a lâk a, thutiemhai vawngtu chu mal a sâwm ta sih a."
But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.,"Nisienlakhawm, sêl ruol loin a chîn lem chu a lien lem malsâwm pêkin a um hlak."
"And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.","Chun, hitaka hin mihriem thi hlakhai hin sâwma pakhat an hmu hlak a, chutaka ruok chun, “a hring zing,” tia a thu an inhriettir chun a hmu a nih."
"And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;","Chun, Levi sâwma pakhat la hlaktu hmanin, Abraham kuta khan sâwma pakhat a pêk tah, ti thei a nih;"
"for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.",Melkizedekin a lo tuok lai khan a pa ṭhâlbeah a la um sih a.
"Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?","Chuongchun, Levihai thiempu nîna leia famkimna hmu thei a ni chun (chu hnuoia chun mihaiin Dân thu an lo hmu sih a), Aron um dân anga ruot loin, Melkizedek um dân anga thiempu dang hung um hi ieng am a ngai na?"
"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.",Thiempu nîna chu a hung danglam ta leiin Dân thu chu suk- danglam ve a hung ngai ta hrim a nih.
"For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.","Hieng a thu an ihril hi hnam dang mi a ni sih a, chu hnam laia mi chu tûkhawm mâichâmah an châng ngai nawh."
For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.,"Ei Lalpa chu Juda hnam laia inthawka hung suok a ni ti ân lang fel sih a, chu hnam thua chun Mosiein thiempuhai kawng thu iengkhawm a hril nawh."
"And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,","Chun, ei thu hril kha nasatakin chieng nâwkzuol a tih: Melkizedek anga thiempu dang,"
"who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:","tisa thupêk Dân thu anga siem mi ni lo, hring tâwp nei lo, thilthaw- theina anga siem lem mi, a hung um ding chun:"
"for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.","“Nang chu Melkizedek um dân anga, Chatuon thiempu i nih ie,” ti inhriettir a ni sih a."
For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness,A hrât naw le a ṭhathnem nawna leiin thupêk um hmasa chu peiin a um a.
"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.",Dân thu chun iengkhawm a sukfamkim si nawh. Beiseina ṭha lem lâk lûta hung um hin Pathien a mîn hnaitir lem a nih.
And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath,"Chun, inkhâm naw a ni naw leiin, anni chu inkhâm loa thiempua siem an ni sih a,"
"(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);","ama ruok chun, “ ‘Nang chu chatuona Thiempu i nih,’ tiin Lalpa ân khâm a, inkîr nâwk ta naw ni,” tia hriltu kut khan (inkhâma Thiem- pua siem a ni lem),"
by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.,chuong ang bawka nasa chun Isu chu thuthlung ṭha lem sukdet- puitu a hung ni tah a.
"And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:","Chun, anni ruok chu thi leia um sawng thei an ni naw leiin, thiempua siem an tam ngei a;"
"but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.",ama ruok chu chatuona a um zing leiin a Thiempu nina chu thleng thei ruol loin a nei ta lem a nih.
"Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.","Chuongchun, amaa Pathien kuoma hunghai chu a tâwp khâwk chenin a sandam thei bawk a nih; anni ṭawngṭai pêk dingin chatuona a hring zing leiin."
"For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;","Chuong ang, Thiempu Laltak, mi inthieng, sawisêlbo, inthieng naw- na kai lo, mi suolhai laia inthawka a tuma um, vânhai nêka chunghnung lema siem ta chu ei ta dingin a âwm hrim sih a."
"who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.","Chuong thiempu lalhai chun ni tin mâni suolna leiin inthawina an inhlân hmasa zet a, chu hnungah mihai suolna leiin an inhlân nâwk a. Chuong chu ama ta ding chun a ngai nawh, ama le ama ân hlân fâwm lai khan ṭum khatah a lo suktlingtla ta leiin."
"For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.","Dân thu chun mihriem hrât nawna neihai chu, Thiempu Laltakah a ruot hlak a; inkhâm thu, Dân thu hnunga hung um ruok chun, Naupa chatuona dinga sukfamkim ta chu a ruot lem a nih."
"Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,","Chuongchun, ei thu hrilhai laia a pawimaw tak chu hi hi a nih: Chuong ang, thiempu Laltak, vânahai khin Ropuitak lalṭhungpha chang tienga hang ṭhung chu ei nei a nih;"
"a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.","Hmun Inthieng le biekbûk taktak, mihriem ibâwl ni loa, Lalpa ibâwl lema rawngbâwltu chu."
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.,"Thiempu Laltak taphawthai chu thilpêk le inthawinahai inhlân dinga ruot an ni sih a; chuongchun, hi Thiempu Laltak khawm hin ieng amani bêk inhlân ding nei a ngai a nih."
"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;",Hnuoia hin hung um sien chu Thiempu hrim ni naw tawp a tih; Dân thu ang peia thilpêk inhlântuhai lo um sa an um leiin.
"who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.","Chuonghai chun vân thilhai chu a lim le a hlim rawng an bâwl hlak a, Mosiein biekbûk a bâwl ding laia, “Tlânga enkhi ding i kuoma inentira um ang tak khan, iengkim siem dingin fimkhur rawh,” tia Pathienin a hril ang khan."
"But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.","Tu ruok hin chu thuthlung ṭha nâwkzuol palai a nizie ang peiin rawngbâwl sin ṭha lem a lo chang tah a, chu thuthlung chu thutiem ṭha lem chungahai siem a nih."
"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.","Chu thuthlung hmasa chu dem- na um lo lo ni sien chu, a pahnina ta ding chun hmun a zawng naw ding bah."
"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;","Anni demin hieng hi a hril a nih: “Ngai ta, nihai a hung tlung ding a ni tah, Lalpain a tih, Chuong niahai chun Israel sûnghai le, Juda sûnghai lai chun thuthlung thar siem ka ta,"
"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.","An thlatuhai Aigupta rama ṭhuoi suok dinga, An kuta ka chel nia, Ka thuthlung ang kha ni loin; Ka thuthlunga chun an um zing si nawh a, Chuongchun, anni chu ka ngaisak ta naw a nih, Lalpain a tih."
"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:","Chuong ni hnunga chun Israel sûnghai kuoma Thu ka thlung ding chu hieng hi a nih, Lalpain a tih; An lungrilah ka thupêkhai sieng ka ta, An lungrilah ziek bawk ka ta; Chun, anni ta dingin Pathien nîng ka ta, Keia ta dingin anni chu ka mihai ni bawk an tih:"
"And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.","Chun, mi tinin, ‘Lalpa chu hre rawh,’ tiin Mâni tuolbâwm le, Mâni unau inchûktir ta naw ni hai a, A chîn taka inthawkin a lien tak chenin, An rêngin an mi hriet seng ta ding leiin."
"For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.","An bawsietnaahai zângai ka ta, An suolhai khawm hre zing ta naw ning,” tiin."
"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.","“Thuthlung thar,” tiin a hril lei khan a hmasa chu a sukhlui tah a nih. Chuongchun, hung hluia hung upa ta chu a bo vâng vâng ta a nih."
"Now even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this world.","Chun, thuthlung hmasa khawm khan Pathien rawngbâwl dânhai le, a hmun inthieng, hi khawvêla hmun inthieng chu a nei a."
"For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein were the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.","Biekbûk an siem a, a tawntir chu khâwnvar siena dâm, dâwkân dâm, entirna bei siena a nih, chu chu Hmun Inthieng an ti a nih."
"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;","Chun, puonzâr pahnina khêla chun biekbûk Hmun Inthieng Tak an ti chu a um a;"
"having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;","chutaka chun riminhnik râwna rângkachak bâwm le, thuthlungna bâwm rângkachak tuia inluon chu a um a; chu thuthlungna bâwm sûnga chun, manna umna rângkachak bêl dâm, Aron hmawl hung inder dâm, thuthlungna lungphêk dâm a um a;"
and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.,"a chungtiengah zângaina ṭhung- pha hliein, ropuina Cherubhai an um bawk a; chuong thuhai chu tuhin chu a kip a kawiin hril thei nâwm ei nih."
"Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;","Chun, chuong thilhai chu chuong anga siem a lo na, Thiempuhaiin Pathien rawng bâwlin biekbûk tawntira chun an lût rawp hlak a;"
"but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:","a dawttua ruok chun Thiempu Laltak chau kum tin vawikhat thisen chawi ngeiin a lût hlak, chu chu mihai le ama suolna ta dingin ân hlân hlak."
"the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;","Thlarau Inthiengin hi hi ân hriettir a; Hmun inthienga lûtna lampui chu a lân lang hri nawh a, biekbûk tawntir chu a la ngîr sûng chun, ti hi;"
"which is a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,","chu chu tulai tekhina hi a nih; chuong ang peiin thilpêk le in- thawinahai khawm an inhlân hlak, chuonghai chun sie le ṭha hrietna kawnga chun a betu chu a sukfamkim thei nawh;"
"being only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.","chuong chu fâk ding dâm, dâwn ding dâm, sâwp ding dang dang dâm leh, tisa tieng dânhai chau siem ṭhat hun hmaa dinga ruot chu a nih."
"But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,","Nisienlakhawm, Krista chu thil ṭha hung um dinghaia Thiempu Laltak hung niin, biekbûk kuta bâwl naw, (chu chu hieng thilsiem laia mi hi a ni nawh tina a nih), ropui le famkim lem fe thlengin,"
"nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.","ei ta dingin chatuona intlanna hmu tain, kêlte le bâwngte thisen lei ni loin, ama thisen lem leiin, Hmun Inthienga chun vawikhatah a lût thleng ta nghâl a."
"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:","Kêl le bâwngchalhai thisen le, bâwngla vâm mi inthieng naw chunga the hmanin tisa inthieng khawpa a sukthieng si chun,"
"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?","Krista, chatuona Thlarau hmêl- hem loa Pathien kuoma inhlân thisen chun Pathien hring rawng bâwl dingin in sie le ṭha hrietna chu thilthaw thihaia inthawk chun a va sukthieng nasa âwm de!"
"And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.","Chun, hi lei hin ama chu thuthlung thar palai chu a nih, thuthlung hmasa hnuoia bawsiet- nahaia inthawk intlanna dingin mi a lo thi ta leiin, koa umhai chun chatuona ro hluo ding chu chang thei an tih."
"For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.",Thurosie umna taphawtah a sietu thina um ve naw thei a ni si nawh a.
For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.,"Mi an thi hnungin thurosie chun thu a nei sih a, a sietu a la dam sûng chun thu a nei hlak am a nih?"
Wherefore even the first covenant hath not been dedicated without blood.,"Chuongchun, thuthlung hmasa khawm kha thisen naw chun an sukdet nawh."
"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,","Dân thu ang peiin thupêk taphawt chu Mosiein mi po po a hril hnungin bâwngte le kêlte thisen chu, tui le senlâr le, husawp leh a lâk a, lekhabu ngei le mi po po khawm chu a theh a."
"saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.","“Hi hi Pathienin in kuoma a pêk tlat thuthlung thisen a ni hi,” tiin."
Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.,Chu naw khawm chu biekbûk le rawngbâwlna hmangruo po po chu chuong ang bawk chun thisen chun a the tah a.
"And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.","Chun, Dân chun chu iengkim deuthaw hi thisena sukthiengin a um hlak a, thisen insuo naw chun ngai- damna hrim a um nawh."
It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.,"Chuongchun, vâna thil um anghai chu sukthiengin a um hrim ding a nih, vân thil taktakhai ruok chu chuong nêka inthawina ṭha lem haiin sukthiengin a um ding a nih."
"For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:",Krista chu kuta bâwl hmun inthieng a tak angpuia chun a lût si nawh a; tuhin Pathien hmaa ei aia ngîr dingin vâna ngei a lût ta lem a;
"nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;","nisienlakhawm, Thiempu Lal- tak chu kum tinin, mâni thisen naw, thisen chawi puma Hmun Inthiengah a lût hlak angin, ama chu mâni inhlân rawp dingin a lût naw bawk a,"
else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.,"chuongchu ni naw sienla leilung insieng tira inthawk vawi tamtak a tuor ta ding a na; nisienlakhawm, tulai hun tâwpa hin inthâwina dinga inhmang fâwmin, suol sukbona dingin vawi khatah a hung inlang ta nghâl a nih."
"And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this cometh judgment;","Chun, mihriem ta dingin vawi khat thi ruot a nih, chu hnunga chun rorêlna um a tih;"
"so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.","chuong ang bawkin Krista khawm mi tamtakhai suol fepui dinga vawi khat inhlâna um tain, sandamna hmu dinga ama lo nghâktuhai kuoma chun, suol ṭhang loin vawi hninaah hung inlang nâwk a tih."
