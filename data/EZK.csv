"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.","Kum sâwmthumna kum, a thla linaa, ni nga ni chun, Kebar vadung panga salhai laia ka um lai chun, vânhai a hung inhawng a, chun, Pathiena thil hmulâwkhai chu ka hmu tah a."
"In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,","Chu thla ni nga ni, (chu chu lal Jehoiakin sala ân tâng a kum ngana kum a na)."
"the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.","Kebar vadung panga Kaldaihai rama chun, Buzi naupa thiempu Ezekiel kuoma chun LALPA thu chu fietakin a hung tlung tah a; chutaka chun ama chunga chun LALPA kut chu a um a."
"And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.","Chun, ka hang en a, ngai ta, hmârtienga inthawkin thlipui nasa- tak a hung hrâng a, sûm nasatak, meia inlap pup pup, a vêl po poa var, a mei lai tak darsen tle anga tle zur zur a um a."
And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man;,"Chun, chutaka inthawk chun thilhring ang pali an hung suok a. Hi hi an inlang dân chu a nih: mihriem hawina an nei a."
"and every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.","Hmai pali an nei chit a, thla pali an nei chit bawk a."
And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.,An kehai chu ke intluon ringawt hi an na; an kephahai chu bâwngtê kepha ang a nih; dârsen nâwttle angin an tleh a.
And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings thus:,"An sîr lia an thlahai hnuoia chun mihriem kuthai ang kut an nei a; chuongchun, an pali chun chuong ang chun thlahai le hmaihai chu an nei a;"
their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.,"an thlahai chu ân zawmtuo seng a, an fe pha khawmin an inher ngai nawh a; an rêng el chun hmatieng ngawt an fe el hlak a nih."
"As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.","Chun, an hmaihai inangpui thua chun, mihriem hmai ang an nei a; an pali chun changtieng panga chun sakeibaknei hmai ang an nei a; an pali chun vawitieng panga chun bâwngchal hmai ang an nei a; an pali chun mupui hmai ang hi an nei chit bawk a."
"And their faces and their wings were separate above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.","Chun, a chungtienga chun an thlahai an zâr a; an rêng chun, an thla pahnihai chu an zâr zawm a; pahnihai chun an taksa chu ân khum a."
"And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.","Chun, an rêng el chun, hma- tieng zâwng ngawtin an feh a; thlarau a fena tieng tienga chun an fe ve a; an fe lai chun sîrtieng an inher ngai nawh."
"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.","Chuong thilhringhai laia chun thil pakhat, meiling chawklai ang, meiser ang el, thilhringhai laia asuk atunga fe a um a, mei chu a var hle a, meia inthawk chun kâwlinlep a suok a."
And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.,"Chun, thilhringhai chu kâwl inlep var inkhaw ang hin an tlân a, an kîr nâwk a."
"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.","Chu thilhringhai ka en zing lai chun, thilhringhai sîra chun tawlailîr ke, pakhat chutaka hmai palihai pakhat senga dingin, hnuoi chunga chun ka hmuh a."
The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.,"Chu tawlailîr ke inlang dân le an sinthaw chu berul lung zie ang a na, an pali chun inangna an nei seng a; an inlang dân le an sinthaw dân chu tawlailîr kekuol sûnga tawlailîr kekuol um ang a nih."
"When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.","An fe pha khawm, an sîr lia chun an feh a; an fe pha chun an inher ngai nawh."
"As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.","An kekuolhai chu, an insângin ṭi an um hle a; an pali chun kekuol mita siphai chu an nei seng a."
"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.","Thilhringhai chu an fe pha chun, tawlailîr kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun an fe ve pei a, chun, tawlailîr kekuolhai chu, thilhring- hai chu hnuoia inthawka dawm kâng an ni pha chun, an inkâng ve pei a."
"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.",Khâw tieng tieng khawm thla- rau a fena tienga chun an feh a; thlarau chu a fena tieng tienga chun tawlailîr kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun dawm kângin an um a; thilhringhai thlarau chu tawlailîr kekuolhaia chun a um sih a.
"When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.","Sâwngsaw an fe pha, hieng khawm hi an feh a; sâwngsaw an ngîr pha hieng khawm hi an ngîr a; chuonghai chu hnuoia inthawka dawm kâng an ni chun, tawlailîr kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun dawm kâng an ni veh a, thilhringhai thlarau chu tawlailîr kekuolhaia chun a um sih a."
"And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.","Thilhring lua chun vân ang el krustal lung ṭiumtak zie ang, chung- tienga an lu chunga inzâm suok hi a um a."
"And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.","Chun, vân ang hnuoia chun an thlahai, tuok khat chu thilhring dang tâwkin ân zâr a; tuok khat dang chun an taksa an inkhum a."
"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.","Chun, an lâwn pha chun, an thla ri chu: tui nasatak ri ang elin, Iengkimthawthei râwl ri ang elin, sipai ruol ri ang, buoi mur mur ri ang ka hriet a. An ngîr pha chun, an thlahai chu an sie thlâk a."
"And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.","Chun, an luhai chunga vân chunga chun râwl ri a um a; an ngîr pha chun, an thlahai chu an sie thlâk a."
"And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.","An luhai chunga, vân chunga chun, lalṭhungpha ang, sapphir lung anga inlang a um a; lalṭhungpha angtak chunga chun mihriem anga inlang a um a."
"And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.","Chun, a kâwng chungtienga po chun ṭhihna zie ang, a vêla a sûnga mei anga inlang ka hmu bawk a; chun, a kâwng le a hnuoitieng inlang dâna chun, mei anga inlangin ka hmuh a, ama vêla po po chun var chu a um a."
"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.","Ruo sûr nia sûma sumrisâng inlang angin, a vêla varna inlang dân chu a um a. Hi hi LALPA ro- puina angpui inlang dân chu a nih. Chun, chu chu ka hmu phing chun, bawkkhupin ka tlu a, chun, mi pakhat râwl thu hung hrilin ka hriet a."
"Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.","Chun, ka hang en a, ngai ta, cherubhai lu chunga vâna chun sapphir lung ni âwmtak, lalṭhungpha ang hi a hung inlang a."
"And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.","Chun, mi puon zai inhmia inchei kuoma chun thu a hril a, “Cherubhai hnuoia tawlailîr kekuol invirhai inkâra chun fe la, cherubhai inkâra meihawl chu i kut khinghniin suksip ve ve la, chun, khawpui chunga chun the dar rawh,” tiin. Chun, ka mithmu ngeia chun a va lût tah a."
"Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.","Chun, mi chu a va lût lai chun cherubhai chu in changtieng panga chun an ngîr a; chun, sûm chun tuol- lai sûng ril lem chu a suksip tah a."
"And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.","Chun, cheruba inthawk chun LALPA ropuina chu a tungin a kai a; in kawtkhâr bula chun a ngîr tah a; chun, in chu sûmin a hung sip a, tuollai chu LALPA ropuina var chun a hung sip tah a."
"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.","Chun, cherubhai thla ri chu Pathien Iengkimthawtheiin thu a hril laia a râwl angin, tuollai puo lema inthawk khawm chun ân hriet a."
"And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.","Chun, mi puon zai inhmia inchei kuoma chun, “Tawlailîr kekuol invir zinghai inkâra inthawk chun, che- rubhai inkâra inthawk chun, mei la la,” tia thu a pêk chun, a va lût a, tawlailîr kekuol sîra chun a va ngîr tah a."
"And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.","Chun, cherub pakhat chun che- rubhai inkâra inthawk chun, cherub- hai inkâra mei chu a kutin a hei ban a, a hei lâk tah a, chun, chu chu mi puon zai inhmia inchei kuthaia chun a sieh a, ama chun a lâk a, a fe suok tah a."
And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.,"Chun, cherubhai thla hnuoia chun mihriem kut ang hi a hung inlang tah a."
"And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.","Chun, ka hei en a, ngai ta, cherubhai sîra chun kekuol pali, cherub pakhat sîrah kekuol pakhat, cherub dang sîrah kekuol dang pakhat ka hmuh a. Chuong kekuolhai inlang dân chu berul lung ang el a nih."
"And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel.","Chun, an inlang dâna chun, an pali chun inangna an nei seng a, kekuol pakhat chu kekuol dang sûnga um ang elin."
"When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.","An lâwn pha chun, an sîr lia chun an lâwn a; an lâwn lai chun sîrzâwngin an inher ngai nawh a; amiruokchu, a hmasatak chun a nghatna tieng tienga chun an zui pei a; an lâwn lai chun sîrzâwngin an inher nawh."
"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.","Chun, an taksa pumpui dâm, an ruongzânghai dâm, an kuthai dâm, an thlahai dâm, an kekuolhai dâm, chuong ang palia kekuol an neihai chu, mit ringawt hin a sip vawng a."
"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.","Chuong kekuolhai chu, ka hrieta chun kekuol invir zinghai tiha inbûk an nih."
"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.","Chun, cherub tin chun hmai pali an nei seng a; hmai pakhatna chu cherub hmai chu a na, hmai pahnina chu mihriem hmai a na, hmai pa- thumna chu sakeibaknei hmai a na, a palina chu mupui hmai a nih."
And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.,"Chun, cherubhai chu dawm kângin an um a, hi hi a nih Kebar vadung panga thilhring ka hmu chu."
"And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.","Cherubhai chu an lâwn pha chun, kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun an lo lâwn veh a; cherubhai chun hnuoia inthawka inlakâng dinga an thlahai an suksâng pha chun kekuolhai khawm chu anni sîra inthawk chun an inher hmang chuong nawh a."
"When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.","An ngîr pha chun, hieng hi an ngîr veh a, an indawm kâng pha chun hieng hi anni ruolin an indawm kâng veh a; annia chun thilhring thlarau chu a um sih a."
"And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.","Chun, LALPA ropuina chu in kawtkhâr bula inthawk chun a fe suok a, cherubhai chunga chun a ngîr tah a."
"And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.","Chun, cherubhai chun an thla- hai chu an zâr a, an fe suok lai chun ka mithmua ngei chun hnuoia in- thawk chun an insukkâng a; kekuol- hai khawm chu an sîrhaia chun an um veh a; chun, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr saktienga chun an ngîr a; chun, an chunga chun Israel PATHIEN ropuina chu a um a."
This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.,"Kebar vadung panga, Israel Pathien hnuoia thilhring ka hmu chu hi hi a nih; chun, cherubhai an nih ti ka hriet bawk a."
"Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.","Cherub tin chun hmai hran pali seng an nei a, thla pali seng leh; chun, an thlahai hnuoia chun mihriem kut angpui a um bawk a."
"And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.","Chun, an hmêl ka hmuhai ang kha an na, an inlang dân le annihai hrim hrim chu; anni chu tlûntakin hmatieng an fe seng a."
"Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.","Chu nawa chun thlarau chun a mi hang dawm kâng a. LALPA in dâi saktieng kawtkhâr, saktieng sawnga chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a; chun, ngai ta, chu dâi kawtkhâra chun mi sâwmhni panga an um a; chun, anni laia chun Azzur naupa Jaazania le Benaia naupa Pelatia, mipuihai hotuhai chu ka hmuh a."
"And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mi- hriem naupa, hi khawpuia thurâwn rilo pea, suolna suksuoktuhai chu hieng mihai hi an nih."
"that say, The time is not near to build houses: this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.","Anni chun, ‘Inhai bâwlna ding hun a hnai ta a ni nâwm a nih? Hi khawpui hi sumbepui chu a na, eini hi a sahai chu ei nih,’ an tih a."
"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.","Chuleiin, an chunga chun thu hrillâwk la, aw mihriem naupa, hrillâwk rawh,” a ta."
"And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.","Chun, LALPA thlarau chu ka chungah a hung tlung a, ka kuoma chun, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih ti hril rawh: Aw Israel sûngkuohai, chuong ang chun in hril am a ni; in lungrilhaia thil hung lûthai chu ka hriet sih a."
"Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.","Hi khawpuia hin in mi thathai chu in sukpung a, chutaka kawtthlêr- hai chu mi thathaiin in suksip a."
"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: In ithathai a sûnga in inzâltirhai hi, sa chu an nih; khawpui chu sumbepui chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, a sûnga inthawk chun lâk suokin um a tih."
"Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Kâwlhnâm chu in ṭih a; in chung- ah kâwlhnâm chu hung intlungtir ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
"And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun la suok ka ti cheu a, hmêlhrietlohai kutah pêng ka ti cheu a, chun, nang- ni lai chun rorêlna chu tirsuok ka tih."
Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.,"Kâwlhnâmah tlûng in ta, Israel ramria chun ro rêlpêk ka ti cheu a; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti hre tâng in tih."
"This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;","Hi khawpui hi in sumbepui chu ni naw nih a, nangni khawm a sûnga sa chu ni nâwng in tih; Israel ramria chun ro ka rêlpêk ding cheu a nih;"
"and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.","chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti hre tâng in tih; ka thuruothaia chun in fe nawh a, ka rorêlhai khawm in zâwm si nawh a; amiruokchu, in vêla hnam- hai dân ang chun in thaw ta lem a,” tiin."
"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?","Chun, thu ka hril lai chun Benaia naupa Pelatia chu a thi tah a. Chun, ka hmaia hnuoi sikin ka bawk- khup a, râwl inringtakin ka khêk a, “A khai, Lalpa PATHIEN! Israel la um sunhai hi i suktâwp el ding am a nih?” tiin."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.","“Mihriem naupa, i unauhai, i unauhai ngei, i chipuihai, Israel sûngkuo po po chu, an rêngin, an kuoma chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chun, ‘LALPAA inthawk chun fe hmang unla, keini kuomah hi ram hi nei dinga pêk a ni tah,’ an tih a;"
"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.","chuleiin, hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ‘Hnamhai laia inthawka hlataka chun ka lo sawn ta deh a, ramhai laia chun anni chu ka lo sukdar ta deha chu, an va fena ramhaia chun hun sâwt nawtê sûnga ding chun an ta dingin hmun inthieng la ni ta fan ka tih’ tiin."
"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.","Chuleiin, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, hnamhai laia inthawk chun la khâwm ka ti cheu a, sukdara in umna ramhaia inthawk chun kei khâwm ka ti cheu a, Israel ram chu pêng ka ti cheu,’ ti rawh."
"And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.","Chun, chutaka chun hung an ta, chutaka inthawk chun thil tirdakum- hai po po le thil pawrchehai po po chu la hmang an ta."
"And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;","Anni chu lungril hmunkhat pêng ka ta; nangmaa chun lungril thar sie bawk ka tih; chun, an tisaa lungril lung anga ngar chu lâng ka ta, an kuoma chun tisa lungril innêm pêng ka tih."
"that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.","Ka thuruothaia an fe theina ding le, ka dânhai chu an kawl a, an thaw theina dingin; chun, ka mihai hung nîng an ta, kei khawm an Pathien nîng ka tih."
"But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, an lungrilhaia an tirdakumna le an pawrchenahai zâwmtuhai chu, an lu chunghaia ngei chun an suol maw chu innghat ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
"Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.","Chun, cherubhai chun an thla- hai chu an zâr a, kekuolhai chu an sirahai chun a um a; chungtienga chun Israel ropuina chu an chungah a um a."
"And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.","Chun, LALPA ropuina chu khawpui laia inthawk chun a hung suok a, khawpui saktieng sîra um tlâng chunga chun a hang ngîr tah a."
"And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.","Chun, thlarau chun a mi dawm- kâng a, Pathien thlaraua thilhmu- lâwknaa chun Kaldaia sal intânghai kuoma chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a. Chuongchun, ka thilhmulâwk hmu chun chungtieng a mi fesan tah a."
Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.,"Chun, sal intânghai kuoma chun LALPAIN ka kuoma a lo inentir tah thilhai po po chu ka hril tah a."
"The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung nâwk a.
"Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.","“Mihriem naupa, nang sûngkaw hel hmang, hmûna dinga mithai nei sih a, hmu lohai, hrietna dinga nahai nei sih a, hre lohai laia chêng, sûng- kaw hel hmang an ni sih a."
"Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.","Chuleiin, nang mihriem naupa, sal intâng ding angin thuomhnaw intêl la, sûnah an mithmu ngeiah fe suok rawh; chun, an mithmua chun i hmuna inthawkin hmun dangah insawn rawh; sûngkaw hel hmang an ni nâka chu an ngaituo thei rawi mawh."
"And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.","Chun, i thuomhnaw chu sûnah an mithmuah hung la suok i ta, sal intâng ding angin; chun, sal intânga fe dinghai thaw angin zântieng hun- ah an mithmuah nang ngei chu fe suok i ta."
"Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.","An mithmua chun bang chu ver âwng la, chutaka chun i thuomhnaw chu la suok rawh."
"In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.","An mithmua chun i liengkoah phur i ta, inthima chun phur pei i ta; i hmai khawm hnuoi hmu lo dingin în khum ding a nih; Israel sûngkuohai dinga inchiknaah ka sie ta si cheh a,” tiin."
"And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.","Chun, chuonga thu pêka ka um ang tak chun ka thaw tah a; ka thuomhnaw chu sûnah ka hung lâk suok a, sal intâng ding ang tak chun; chun, zântieng chun ka kutin bang chu ka ver âwng a; thuomhnaw chu inthima chun ka hung lâk suok a, an mithmua chun ka liengkoah ka phur tah a."
"And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,","Chun, zîngkâr chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?","“Mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo, sûngkaw hel hmang chun i kuomah, ‘Ieng am i thawh a?’ an ti che a ni naw maw?"
"Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.","an kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, ti rawh, Hi chungrikna hin Jerusalema lal le Israel sûngkuohai po po an umnahai chu a kâwk a nih."
"Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.","Hril la, in ta dinga inchikna ka na, ka thaw ta angin an kuoma chun hung tlung a tih, hnawt suoknaa chun, salah an fe ding a nih."
"And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.","Anni laia lal um chun inthim hnuoia chun a liengkoin phur a ta, fe suok a tih; chutaka phursuok- na ding chun bang chu ver âwng an tih; a mithaia hnuoi a hmu nawna dingin a hmai chu inkhum tlat a tih."
"My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.","Chun, ka lên khawm chu a chunga chun dêngkhum ka ta, ka chânga chun âwk a tih; chun, Kaldai- hai ram Babulona chun ṭhuoi ka ta; chutaka chun thi ding ni sien khawm, hmu chu hmu naw ni."
"And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.","Chun, a pâwlhai po po le, ama vêla ama ṭhangpuituhai ding po po chu kil tinah the dar ka ta; an hnunga kâwlhnâm chu phawi ka tih."
"And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.","Chun, ramhaia ka hnawt dar pha le, hnamhai laia ka sukdar pha chu LALPA kha ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih."
"But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, anni laia mi tlâwmte chu kâwlhnâma manih, hri- puia manih, ṭâmnaa inthawkin amani chun hlâng ka ta; an fena tieng tienga hnamhai kâwla chun an tirdakumna po po chu an phuongdar theina dingin; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
"Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,","Chu nawa khawm LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;","“Mihriem naupa, i bei kha inthin pumin fa la, i tui khawm kha inthin pum le ṭitak pumin dâwn rawh;"
"and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and despoiled of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.","chun, kha rama mipuihai kuoma chun, Israel ram le Jerusalem hluotuhai chungthua chun Lalpa PATHIENIN hieng ang hin a tih; an bei chu ṭitumna leh fâng an ta, an tui chu maktina leh dâwn bawk an tih, chutaka chêngtuhai po po pâwng- nêkna leiin, chutaka umhai po pohaia inthawka chu ram chu râusan a ni theina dingin."
"And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, khawpui, hluoa umhai chu suksiet nîng a ta, ram chu râusan nîng a tih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?","“Mihriem naupa, hi thuvar Israel rama in inei, ‘Nihai chu sukseiin a um a, thilhmulâwkhai tin chu a puitling ta nawh,’ ti hi ieng tina am a na?"
"Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Hi thuvar hi suktâwp ka ta, Israel rama chun thuvarah hmang ta naw ni hai; amiruokchu, an kuoma chun hril la; thilhmulâwk thu tin tlungna chu a hnai tah,’ tiin."
For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.,"Israel sûngkaw sûnga chun thilhmulâwk teplo amanih, aiena inhlêmna hrim hrim a um ta naw ding a ni sih a."
"For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","LALPA chu ka ni sih a: thu hril ka ta, chu ka thuhril chu thawin a um ngei ding a nih; sukbahla ni ta ngai naw ni; aw sûngkaw hel hmang, in nihaia chun thu hril ka ta, thaw ni bawk a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
"Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a,"
"Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.","“Mihriem naupa, ngai ta, Israel sûngkuohai chun hieng hin an ta, ‘Thil hmulâwk a hmuhai hi ni sâwttak la hung tlung dinghaia mi ding chu a na, hun la hlataka mi dinghai chu a lo hril a nih,’ tiin."
"Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ka thu hrim hrim chu sukbahla ni ta naw nih a, amiruokchu, thu ka ihril chu thawin a um lem ding a nih,’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:","“Mihriem naupa, Israel rama zâwlnei, anni lungrila inthawk ela thuhrillâwkhai hril hlaktuhai kuoma chun thu hril la, ‘LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u,’ ti rawh."
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: zâwlnei invêt, iengkhawm hmu si loa mâni ngaidân ngawt zâwmtu chu a chung a rik!"
"O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.","Aw Israel, i zâwlneihai chu hmun ṭâwpa sihalhai ang an ni tah a."
"Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.","A âwnga chun in hang fe nawh a, LALPA nia indonaa ngîrna dingin Israel sûngkaw ta ding chun paldâi in siem bawk nawh a."
"They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.","Anni chun teplo mei mei le vân tieng thil khêl thu an hmu a, LALPA- IN anni chu a tir naw sain, ‘LALPAIN a tih’ tiin an thu chu sukdet ni ngei dingin mihai an inbeiseitir a."
"Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?","Keiin ka hril nawh a, ‘LALPA chun a hril a nih,’ in ti hin thilhmulâwk teplo chu in hmuin vântieng thil inkhêl chu in hril a ni nâwm a nih?” tiin."
"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: “Teplo mei mei in hril a, khêlhai chu in hmu leiin, ngai ta u, nangni chu ka dodâl cheu a nih.

"And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.","Vântieng thukhêl le, zâwlnei teplo mei mei hmutuhai chunga chun ka kut chu um a ta; ka mihai in- khâwmnaa chun ṭhang ve naw ni hai a, Israel sûngkaw chanchin inziek- naa chun ziek ni bawk naw nih a; Israel rama chun lût bawk naw ni hai a; chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng in tih."
"Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar:","‘Inremna,’ tiin ka mihai chu an ṭhuoi suol a; inremna chu a um nawh a, chun, miin bang a siem lai chun, ngai ta, chirhak inhnâk loin an bel a;"
"say unto them that daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.","chuong chirhak inhnâk loa beltuhai kuoma chun, a tla nâwk el ding a nih ti hril rawh, ruo a hrâta hrât hung sûr a ta, riel nasatak tlâng a ta, thlipui nasatakin nuoi a tih."
"Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?","Ngai ta u, bang chu a tla pha chun in kuomah, ‘In ibelna chu khâwlai am a um leh?’ an ti naw ding cheu maw?"
"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; Ka lunginsenin thlipui hrângin suksieng ka tih; ka lunginsennaa chun ruo a hrâta hrâta sûr um a ta, a sukbohmang ding lunginsena riel nasatak leh."
"So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chuongchun, bang chirhak in- hnâk loa in bel kha suksieng ka ta, hnuoiah hung la thlâng ka tih; chuongchun, a lung phûm chu inlang tâng a ta, tlûng a ta, chu sûnga chun sukbohmangin um in tih; chun, LALPA ka ni mi hre tâng in tih."
"Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;","Chuong ang chun ka lungin- senna chu bang chunga le chirhak inhnâk loa beltuhai chunga chun sukpuitling ka ta; in kuoma chun, ‘Bang chu a um ta nawh a, a beltuhai khawm,’ tîng an tih."
"to wit, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Zâwlneihai Jerusalem chung- thu hrillâwktu le inremna um silo inremna dinga thilhmulâwk hmuhai chunga chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
"And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, an lungrila inthawka thu hriltuhai, i mihai naunuhai tieng chu ngha rawh; anni kalin thu hril la,"
"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?","Lalpa PATHIEN chun, ‘Nu- hmei, kutrîng tina inbuntir ding ṭhuitu le, thlahai pêl dinga mi saput ieng ang po el lua dinga rawmawl siem chu a chung a rik de! a tih,’ ti rawh. Ka mihai thlahai chu pêlin nangni ta ding chauin thla chu in sandam ding maw?"
"And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.","Buṭei vei khat le bei hlek hmu dingin ka mihai lai chun, mi thi lo dinghai chu that ding le, mi hring lo dinghai chu sandam dingin, thu khêl ngai hlak ka mihai chu hlêmin, ka mihai lai chun i mi lo sukhmingsiet tah a."
"Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, Ngai ta u, vate anga manna dinga in thil inbuntirhai chu ka dodâl a nih; in kuthaia inthawkin ka keithlêr ding a nih; in man tumhai chu infetir ka ta, vate anga in ipêlhai ngei chu."
"Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","In rawmawlhai chu keithlêr ka ta, ka mihai chu in kuta inthawkin sansuok ka tih; chun, pêl dingin in kuta chun um ta naw ni hai; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih."
"Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive;","Mi fel lungril ka suklungngai naw chu thukhêla in suklungzîng tâk leiin mi rilo kuthai khawm in lo suk- hrât tah a, a lampui riloa inthawka a kîr nâwk nawna dingin hringna thu in tiem a;"
"Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","chuleichun, teplo chu hmu nâwk ta naw ti niu a, vântieng thil- hmulâwkhai khawm chu; chun, ka mihai chu in kuta inthawkin sansuok ka ta, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
"Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.","Chun, Israel upa ṭhenkhat ka kuomah an hung a, ka hmaa chun an ṭhung a."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?","“Mihriem naupa, hieng mihai hin an milimhai chu an lungrilhaia chun an lâk tlat a, an hmaihmaa chun an suolna tlûkna lunghai chu an sie tah a; annihai thu indawn hin ka la um rawp ding am a nih?"
"Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun thu hril la, an kuomah, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih, Israel sûngkuo laia mi tukhawm a milimhai chu a lungril sûnga la tlat a, a hmaihmaa a suolna tlûkna lung sietu zâwlnei kuoma hung si chu, keima LALPA ngeiin a milimhai tamzie ang peiin dawn ka tih;"
"that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.","an milimhai leia keimaa in- thawka an invâkhmang vawng tâk leiin, Israel sûngkuo chu an lungril- hai ka lâk theina dingin’ tiin."
"Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.","Chuleiin, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hril la, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Hung kîr unla, in milimhaia inthawkin fe hmang ro; chuongchun, in tirdakumnahai po poa inthawk chun in hmai chu ngha hmang ro."
"For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself:","Israel sûngkuoa mi tin amanih, Israel rama mikhuol inzin mikhuol amanih khawm keimaa inthawka pêthrana, a milimhai chu lungrila la tlata, a hmaihmaa a suolna tlûkna lung sie a, ama ta dinga ka kuoma thu indawn dinga zâwlnei kuoma hung si chu; kei LALPA ngeiin, keiin dawn ka tih;"
"and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","chu mipa chunga chun ka hmai innghat ka ta, thuvara inchikna ding- in thilmakah siem ka ta, ka mihaia inthawk chun ama chu sât thlâng ka tih; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng in tih."
"And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.","Chun, zâwlnei chu hlêmin a um a, thu a hril chun, kei LALPA hin chu zâwlnei chu ka hlêm a na, ama chunga chun ka kut inlet ka ta, ka mi Israelhai laia inthawkin ama chu sukbohmang ka tih."
And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh unto him;,"Chun, an suol maw chu phur an ta; zâwlnei suolna chu mi ama kuom- ah zawngtu suolna ang ngei chu nîng a tih;"
"that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Israel sûngkuo chu keimaa inthawka an fe pêt ta nawna ding le, an bawsietnahai po po leia anni an insukpawrche ta nawna dingin; ami- ruokchu, ka mihai an hung ni theia, an Pathien ka ni theina dingin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"

"Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.","Chun, tuiin kân sil cheh a; anih, i thisen chu nangmaa inthawk chun ka sâwpfai vawng a, hriek ka nâl cheh a."
"I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.","Puon cheimawiin kân thuom cheh a, seal vun kekawk kân buntir cheh a, puon zai inhmiin ka hrên cheh a, tuktulungêk puonin ka tuom che kha."
"And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.","Incheina thuomhaiin ka chei cheh a, i kuta chun bânbunhai kân buntir cheh a, i rîngah khaidiet leh."
"And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.","Chun, i hnârah hnârbê le, i na- haia chun nabêhai le, i lu chungah lukhum mawitak ka sieh a."
"Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate.","Chuongchun, rângkachak le tangkaruoa cheiin i um a; i silfênhai khawm, puon zai inhmi dâm, tuktu- lungêk puon dâm le puon cheimawi dâm an nih; beiphit indîtak le khuoizu le hriek chu i fâk a; i hung hmêlṭha êm êm el a; chun, lalnu khawm chu i hung tling pei tah a."
"And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.","I mawina leiin i hming chu hnamhai laia chun ân darsuok a; kân lalna leia i chunga ka lo sie ta chu, ṭhat famkimna a ni sih a.’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
"But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was.","“Nisienlakhawm, i hmêl ṭhatna chu i ring a, i hming inthangna lei chun nawchizawrah i um tah a; nang- ma hung khêltu taphawthai chunga chun i châkna chu i phal a; ama ta a ni tah a."
"And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors, and playedst the harlot upon them: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.","I silfênhai chu i lâk a, i bâwl- hmunhai chu ze dang dangin i chei a; a chunga chun nawchizawrna thil chu i thaw tah a; chuong ang thil chu um nâwk ta ngai naw nih a, chuong ang chu a la ni ngai bawk nawh."
"Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;","Ka rângkachak le ka tangka în cheina hluhai ka pêkhai che chu i lâk a, mihriemhai limhaia chun i siem a, anni le chun nawchizawrna thil chu i thaw tah a;"
"and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.","i puon cheimawihai chu i lâk a, anni chu în khum a; an hmaa chun ka sahriekhai le riminhnikhai chu în tung a;"
"My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor; and thus it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.","ka bei ka ipêk che, beiphit indî- tak, hriek le khuoizu leh, ka châwm- na che chu, an hmaa chun riminhnika dingin i sie ve bawk a, chuong chu a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
"Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,","Chu nawa khawm chun, naunu- hmeihai le naupasalhai i mi nei- pêkhai chu i lâk a, an kuomahai chun fâkzoa um dingin inthâwinain i hmang a."
"that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire unto them?","I nawchizawrna chu thil chîn tham a ni ding maw? Ka nauhai i that a, meia infethlengtir dinga an kuoma i pêk hi!"
"And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood.","I nawchizawrna le i tirdakum- nahai poa hin i tleirâwl lai nihai, saruok le ruoka i um a, i thisena în sukpawrche lai kha i hriet zing ta naw a nih."
"And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah),","“Chun, i rîtlona po po hnunga chun (i chung a rik, i chung a rik! Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih),"
"that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.","hmun langsârtak takhai chu i ta dingin i bâwl a, kawtthlêr tinahai chun hmun insângtakhai chu i ta dingin i siem tah a."
"Thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.","Lam tluongpui tinahai chun i hmun insânghai chu i bâwl a, i mawi- na chu tirdakumnain în changtir a, mi a hung khêl taphawt che kuoma chun în hlîm a, i hurna chu i sukpung tah a."
"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.","I tuolbâwm, tisa ropuina, Aigupta mi le khawm chun i lo uire tah a; lunginsennaa mi chophâwk dingin i hurna chu i sukpung tah a."
"Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.","Chuleichun, ngai ta, i chungah ka kut kân let a, i bu pângngai chu ka suktlâwm ding a nih, chun, Philistin naunuhai, i lampui tirdakum inza- puituhai, nangma theidatuhai duthu- sâmah pe suok ka ti che."
"Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.","Mumal boa i um lei khan Assuria mihai kuoma khawm naw- chizawrah i lo insiem tah a; anih, an kuoma chun nawchizawr thil chu i lo thawa chu i lungawi tâwk si nawh a."
"Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.","Chu nawa khawm chun Kanaan rama chun, Kaldai ram chenin i hurna chu i sukpung a; anâhlakchu chu khawm chun i la lungawi tâwk nawh a."
"How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot;","Hieng thil, nuhmei châk tawm tawmhai sin i thaw hi hmuin, ‘I lungril chu a va khawhlo de!’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a ti a nih."
"in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire.","Lampui tluong tinahai chun i hmun langsârhai chu i bâwl a, kawt- thlêr tinahai chun i hmun insânghai chu i siem bawk a; hawman khawm i lâk nawnaa hin nawchizawr el ang khawm i ni nawh."
A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband!,"Nuhmei uirenu, mâni pasal nêka mikhuolhai la lemtu!"
"They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.","Nawchizawrhai po po kuoma chun miin thilpêkhai an pêk hlak a, nang ruok chu i hmangaihai po po chu thilpêkhai i pêk a, anni chu i tham a, i châknaa ding chun sîr tina nangma kuoma an hung theina dingin."
"And thou art different from other women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different.","I châknaa hin nuhmei danghai nêka danglamna a um a, nang chu mi tukhawma châkna ang thaw dingin an hung zui naw chea hin; nang chun hâwman chu i pêk lem a, nangma kuoma chun hawman chu pêk a ni nawh a, chuleiin, i danglam a nih."
"Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:","“Chuleiin, aw nang nawchi- zawr, LALPA thu chu lo hre rawh:"
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; i hmangaituhai kuoma i châkna zâra chun i saruokna chu hmusuok a na, i tirdakumna chu bunsuok a ni bawk lei le; i pawrchena milimhai po po le, an kuoma i lo pêk tah i nauhai thisen po po lei chun,"
"therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.","ngai ta, chuleichun, i hmangai- hai po po chu ko khâwm ka ta, inhawi i lo chênpuihai po po le, i lo hmangai tahai po po le, i lo theida tahai po po le chun, kil tina inthawkin, i chungah hung ṭhuoi khâwm ka ta, i saruokna po pohai chu an hmu theina dingin an kuoma chun i saruokna chu hâwk ka tih."
"And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.","Chun, nuhmei inneina dân baw- se le, mâni nau thisen insuo chunga rorêl angin i chungah rorêl ka tih; i chunga chun îtthîkna le lunginsenna thisen chu hung intlungtir ka tih."
"I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.","Chun, anni kuta chun pe bawk ka ti cheh a, i hmun langsârhai chu peisieng an ta, i hmun insânghai chu sukchim an tih; i puon sil chu hlîppêk an ti cheh a, în cheina thil hluhai chu lâng an tih; chuongchun, saruok le ruokin mâksan an ti che."
"They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.","Nangma chunga chun in- khâwmpuina nei bawk an ta, lung- haiin dêng an ti cheh a, an kâwl- hnâmhaiin sunthleng bawk an ti che."
"And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.","I inhai chu meiin râwng an ta, nuhmei tamtak mithmua chun i chunga rorêlna chu sukthlûng an ta; chun, nawchizawr anga um chu ma dingin siem ka ti cheh a, chun, hawman khawm pe ta ngai hrim hrim naw ti ni."
"So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.","Chuongchun, ka lunginthakna chu i chungah hrîtthlâng ka ta, ka îtthîkna chu nangmaa inthawk chun fe hmang tâng a ta, to ṭawk ṭawk ka ta, lunginsen nâwk ta naw ningah."
"Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.","I tleirâwl lai nihai kha i hriet zing ta nawh a, amiruokchu, hieng thilhaia hin i mi suklungsen a; chuleiin, ngai ta, kei khawma i nun suol maw chu i lu chungah hung intlungtir ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; chun, pawrchenahai po po belsain hi khawhlona hi thaw ta naw ti nih."
"Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.","“Ngai ta, mi tukhawm thuvar- hai hmangtu chun hi thuvar hi i chungah hung hmang an tih, ‘A naunu khawm a nu ang bawk,’ ti hi."
"Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.","Nang chu i nu naunu, a nauhai le a pasal khawm dawnsaklo naunu chu i na, nang chu i zuorpuihai, mâni nauhai le pasalhai khawm dawn- saklohai unaunu chu i na; in nu chu Hit mi a na, in pa khawm Amor mi a nih."
"And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.","I zuorpui upa lem le a naunu- hmeihai chu i vawitienga chêng Samaria hi a na; chun, i zuorpui naupang lem i changtienga chêng chu Sodom le a naunuhmeihai hi an nih."
"Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways.","An lampuihai chu i hrawin, an tirdakumnahaia chun i lungawi tâwk nawh a; amiruokchu, hun sâwt nawtê sûngin i um dân po poah anni nêk hmanin i se lem a."
"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.","Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih, ‘nang le i nau- nuhaiin, nangin i thaw angin i zuor- pui Sodom chun amanih, a naunu khawmin amani khawm a thaw nawh a."
"Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.","Ngai ta, hi hi i zuorpui Sodom suolna chu a nih; ama le a naunuhaia chun chapona, bei ditkhawp, hausaka inhawitirna a um a, mi tlasamhai le mi rimsihai chu a ṭhangpui chuong nawh."
"And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.","An chapo a, ka hmaa chun tirdakumna an thawh a, chuleiin, ṭha ka ti ang peiin anni chu ka lâk hmang tah a."
"Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.","Samaria khawm chun i suol zâtve khawm a thaw nawh a, nang ruok chun anni nêkin i tirdakumna chu i sukpung nasa lem a, chuleiin, tirdakumna i thawhai po po chun i zuorpuihai chu felah în langtir tah a nih."
"Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.","I zuorpuihai fel lema în lang- tirna hin nang ngeiin i muolphona chu phur rawh, anni nêka tirdakum- na nasa lem thawha i suolnahai leiin anni chu nanga nêkin an fel lem a nih, i zuorpuihai chu fel lema în langtir leiin."
"And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;","“An sal nina chu inlet ka ta, Sodom le a naunuhmeihai sal nina, Samaria le a naunuhmeihai sal nina le, anni laia i salhai sal nina khawm inlet ka tih,"
"that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.","an ta dinga thlamuongtu nia i thil lo thaw tahai po poa khan în zak a, i muolphona chu i phur theina dingin."
"And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.","I zuorpuihai Sodom le a nau- nuhmeihai le Samaria le a naunu- hmeihai chu an um dân hmasaa bawk kîr nâwk an ta, nang le i naunu- hmeihai khawm in um dân hmasaa bawk kîr nâwk in tih."
"For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,","I chapo ni khan i zuorpuinu Sodom chu i ṭawngse hnâwkna ni lo am a nih,"
"before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about.","i rîtlona suklang a ni hma khan? Tuhin amanu angin Suria naunu- hmeihai le a vêla umhai po po le, Philistin naunuhai i kîmvêla hmu- sittuhai che hrilsiet i hung ni ta hi."
"Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah.","I hurna le i tirdakumna hremna chu i phur a nih, LALPAIN a tih."
"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: thuthlung bawsea, inkhâm- na hmusita nangin i lo thaw ta ang khan nanga chunga khawm thâwng ka tih."
"Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.","Nisienlakhawm, i tleirâwl lai nihaia nang le ka thuthlung chu hre zing ka ta; chun, nang le chun cha- tuon thuthlung indin ka tih."
"Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.","I unauhai, i unu le i sangnu i pawmlût pha chun naunuhmeihai dingin anni chu i kuomah pêng ka tih, i thuthlung lei ruok chu ni loin."
And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;,"Chun, ka thuthlung chu nang leh sukdet ka tih, chun LALPA ka nih ti mi hre tâng i tih."
"that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Thil i lo thawtahai po poa ka ngaidam pha che chun i hriet zing a, i hmai a mâwk a, în zak leia i bau i kâk dêr ta nawna dingin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;","“Mihriem naupa, thukhirkhân sie suok la, Israel sûngkuohai kuoma chun tekhithu hril rawh;"
"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih a, Mupui ropuitak, thla ropuitak le chang seitakhai nei, hmula sip, ze hran hran nei chu Lebanona chun a hung a, sidar thing zîka chun a hung a;"
"he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.","a zîk insâng tak chu a chuk tan a, Kanaan rama chun a put hmang tah a; sumdâwng mihai khawpuia chun ân thlâk tah a."
"He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.","Chun, chu ram thlai chi chu a lâk bawk a, leihnuoi ṭhataka chun a phun tah a; tui tamtak kâwla chun a sieh a; phahrâm thing angin a sieh a."
"And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.","Chun, a hung inṭhang chun, grêphrui inhnuoitaka inzâm mi a hung na, a kâuhai chu ama tieng chun ân zâm lêt a, a zunghai chu ama hnuoia chun an um a; chuong- chun, grêphrui a hung na, kâuhai a hung nei a; dâwnhai a hung insuo tah a."
"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.","Chun, mupui dang ropuitak thla ropuitakhai le hmul tamtak nei a um bawk a; chun, ngai ta, grêphrui chun a zunghai chu ama tieng chun ân kawmtir a, a kâuhai khawm chu ama tienga bawk chun ân dâwn suoktir a, tui a buok zing theina dingin.

"Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots thereof.","Hril rawh, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; a puitling ding am a nih?

"Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew.","Anih, ngai ta, phunin um de sienkhawm a puitling ding am a nih?

"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a;
"Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon.","“Sûngkaw hel hmanghai kuoma chun thu hril la, ‘Hieng thilhai hi ieng tina am a na ti in hriet naw maw?’ tiin, hril rawh, ngai ta, Babulon lal chu Jerusalema chun a hung a, chutaka lal le, chutaka lal nauhai chu a ṭhuoi a, ama kuomah Babulona chun a fepui tah a;"
"And he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;","chun, lal chi khawm chu a ṭhuoi a, ama le chun thuthlung a siem tah a, chun, ama khawm chun inkhâmna hnuoiah a hung ṭhuoi a, rama mi thilthawtheihai chu a lâk hmang a;"
"that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.","lalram chu a hung inhnuoi a, ama khâta ân dawm kâng thei nawna dingin, chu a thuthlung chu a zâwm lei chaua a ngîr theina dingin."
"But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?","Amiruokchu, mi tamtak le sakawrhai an pêk theina dingin, ama aiawtu chu Aigupta rama tirin, ama chunga chun a hel tah a.

"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.","Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; ama chu lala siemtu, a inkhâmna a hmusit le, a thuthlung a bawsietpêk lal umna hmun, ama kuomah Babulon sûng ngeia chun thîng a tih."
"Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.","Mi tamtak chu sât thla dinga kulhai bâwla, tlângpâwnghai siema an um pha chun, Pharao le a sipai pâwl thilthawtheitakhai le, a pâwl ropuitakhai chun indonaa dingin iengkhawm thawpêk naw ni hai."
"For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.","Thuthlung chu bawsein, in- khâmna chu a lo pêk tah a, amiruok- chu, hieng thilhai po po hi a la thaw ta rawp sih a; pumpel naw hrim hrim a tih."
"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ka hring zing angin ka inkhâmna a hmusit le, ka thuthlung a bawsiet ta chu ama lu chunga ngei chun hung intlungtir ngei ngei ka tih."
"And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.","Chun, a chunga chun ka lên chu keiphar ka ta, ka chânga chun ama chu âwk a ta, ama chu Babulonah hung ṭhuoi ka ta, chutaka chun a bawsietna, ka chunga a lo bawsietna chu a kuomah phût ka tih."
"And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.","Chun, a pâwlhai po po laia a tlân hmanghai po po chu kâwlhnâm- ah tlûng an ta, chun, a la um zinghai khawm chu kil tinah sukdar ni bawk an tih; chun, kei LALPA hin ka lo hril ta a nih ti hre tâng i tih."
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain:","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; sidar lêr zîk insâng chu lâng ka ta, phun ka tih; a lêr zîktaka inthawk chun a kâu dâwng chu ektliek ka ta, tlâng insângtak le lang- sârtak chungah phun ka tih;"
"in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell.","Israel insângna tlânga chun phun ka ta; kâuhai hung insuong a ta, ra hung nei a ta, sidar thing ṭhatak hung nîng a ta; a hnuoia chun vate tinrênghai chu chêng an ta; chutaka a kâuhai hlima chun chêng an tih."
"And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.","Chun, chu loa thing po pohai chun kei LALPA chun thing insâng chu ka keihnuoi a, thing inhnuoi chu ka suksâng tah, thing hring chu ka sukṭâwl a, thing ṭâwl chu ka suk- hring tah ti hrieng an tih; kei LALPA chun ka hrilin ka thaw tah a nih,” tiin."
"The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung nâwk a,"
"What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?","“Hi thuvar Israel rama in hmang, ‘Pahai chun grêp thûr an fâk tah a, nauhai hahai chu a ṭim,’ ti hi ieng tinâm a na?"
"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.","Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; Israel rama chun hi thuvar hi hmangna ding hun hrim nei ta naw ti niu."
"Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.","Ngai ta, thlarau po po chu ka ta an na, pa hringna chu ka ta a ni ang bawkin, naupa hringna khawm chu ka ta a nih; thlarau thil suksuol chu thîng a tih."
"But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,","Amiruokchu, mi chu a fel a, ân dik le dân anga a thawh a,"
"and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor’s wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity,","tlânghai chunga chun a fâk bawk nawh a, Israel sûngkuohai milimhai tieng chun a mithai ân lên bawk nawh a, a tuolbâwm nuhmei chu a lo sukpawrche nawh a, nuhmei insiehran lai a hung hnai bawk nawh a;"
"and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;","tukhawm ân suksuoltir nawh a, battu kuoma chun a hnina chu ân hmutir a, thawluinain tukhawm a suksiet nawh a, mi phîngṭâmhai chu bei a lo pêk tah a, saruokhai chu silfên a lo inkhum tah a;"
"he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,","a pung hnawt dinga pe suok ngai lo a, a pung khawm la ngai lo a, suolnaa inthawka a kut keitîm a, mi le mi inkâra rorêlna indiktak lo hmang hlak a,"
"hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.","indiktaka thaw dinga ka rorêlhai zâwm a, ka thuruothai a pawm chun, ama chu mi indik a na, hring ngei ngei a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
"If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things,","Amiruokchu, naupasal a nei a, inru a nih a, thisen insuotu, hieng thilhai a ieng amani hi thawh a,"
"and that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor’s wife,","hieng thil thaw dinghai hi thaw lo a, amiruokchu, tlâng chunga lo fa tah a, a tuolbâwmhai nuhmei lo suk- pawrche tah a,"
"hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,","mi tlasam le mi rimsihai lo insuksuoltir tah a, thawluinaa lo sukse tah a, hnina lo ngaisak lo a, milimhai tienga a mithai lo inlên tah a, tirdakumnahai lo thaw tah a,"
"hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.","a pung um dinga lo pe suok tah a, a pung khawm lo la ta hlak chu, ama chu a hring ding am a nih? Ama chu hring naw nih a, hieng tirdak- umnahai po po thawtu hi chu thi ngei ngei a ta, a thisen chu ama chunga chun a um ding a nih."
"Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doeth not such like;","Chun, ngai ta, ama chun naupasal hung nei ve sien, a pain suolna a thawhai po po chu lo hmu tah a, ama chun ṭih a, chuonga thaw ve lo a,"
"that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor’s wife,","tlânghai chunga khawm lo la fa lo a, Israel sûngkaw milimhai tienga a mithai khawm lân lên ngai lo a, a tuolbâwm nuhmei khawm lo la sukpawrche lo a,"
"neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;","mi tu chunga khawm lo suksuol ngai lo a, hninaa thutiem la ngai lo a, thawluinaa la sukse ngai lo a, ami- ruokchu, a bei chu tlasamhai kuoma peh a, saruok chu silfêna lo inkhum tah a,"
"that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed mine ordinances, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.","mi rimsihaia inthawka kut lo keitîm tah a, a pung hnawta lo inpûktir lo a, a pung khawm la lo a, ka rorêlnahai lo thaw tah a, ka thuruothai lo zâwm tah; chuong ang mi chu a pa suolna lei chun thi naw nih a, hring ngei ngei a tih."
"As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.","A pa chungthua chun, ama chun rilotakin a lo nêksâwr tah a, thaw- luinain a unau chu a lo suksiet tah a, a mihai laia thil ṭha naw chu a lo thaw leiin ngai ta, a suolnaa chun thi ngei a tih."
"Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.","Amiruokchu, nang chun, ieng- dinga naupa chun pa suolna chu a phur nâwm a na? i ti a ni thei a. Naupa chun dân ang le thil indik chu a thaw pha chun, ka thuruothai chu a pawm bawk a, a thaw bawk chun, hring ngei a tih."
"The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.","Mi a suksuoltu chu, chu chu thîng a ta; naupa chun pa suolna chu phur naw nih a, pa khawma naupa suolna chu phur bawk naw ni; mi fel felna chu mi fel chunga chun um a ta, mi rilo rîtlona chu mi rilo chunga bawk chun um a tih."
"But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.","“Amiruokchu, mi rilo chu a thil suksuolhaia inthawk chun ân her hmang a, ka thuruothai chu a zâwm a, ân dik le dân ang thilhai chu a thaw chun, hring ngei a ta, thi naw nih."
None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.,"A bawsietnahai po po a ieng khawm chu ama chunga chun hriet zing ni ta naw nih a, chun, a felna a ithaw ngeia chun ama chu hring a tih."
"Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?",Mi rilo thina chunga hin inhawi tina hrim ka nei am a nih? Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; a lampuia inthawk chun hung kîr lemin a hring ding a ni naw am a nih?
"But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.","Nisienlakhawm, mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân her hmang a, suolna a thaw chun, mi riloin a thaw hlak anga tirdakumnahai po po kha a thaw ve chun, a hring ding am a nih?

"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?","Amiruokchu, Lalpa lampui chu ân ang rawp nawh a, in la ti a ni thei a; tuhin ngai la, Aw Israel sûngkuo, ka lampui chu ân ang vawng an nâwm a nih? In lampuihai ni lo am a ni ân ang vawng naw chu?"
"When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.","Mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân her hmang a, thil suol a thaw chun thîng a ta, suolna a ithawa chun thîng a tih."
"Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.","Chu nawah, mi rilo chu a rîtlonaa rîtlona a lo thaw tahaia in thawka ân her hmang a, chun, ân dik le dân ang thilhai chu a thaw chun, a thlarau chu hringin sanhim a tih."
"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.","Ama chun a ngaituoh a, a lo thaw tah, a bawsietnahai po poa inthawk chun ân her hmang tâk leiin thi naw nih a, hring ngei ngei a tih."
"Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?","Israel sûngkuo chun, Lalpa lampui chu ân ang vawng lêm, an la ti rawp khawm a ni theia, Aw Israel sûngkuo, ka lampuihai chu ân ang vawng a ni naw maw? Nanga lam- puihai lem an nâwm a nih ân ang naw chu?"
"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.","Chuleiin, Israel sûngkuo, mi tin chu a thilthawhai ang peiin rêlpêk ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih. Hung kîr unla, in bawsietnahai po poa inthawkin hung kîr ro; chuongchun, suolna chu in tlûkna lung hung ni naw nih."
"Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?","In bawsietnahai po po, in lo bawsiet tahai chu, nangnia inthawk- in peihâwn unla, thlarau thar le lung- ril thar insiempêk unla, aw Israel sûngkuo, iengdingin am thîng in ta?"
"For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.","Mi thinaa chun lâwmna ka nei si nawh a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih, chuleiin, hung kîr unla, hring ro,” tiin."
"Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,","Chu nawa chun Israel lalhai ta ding chun sûnna hla phuok la,"
"and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.","I nu chu ieng am a na? Sakeibakneipui a nih, A bawk a, a têhai châwmin, sakeibaknei tuoihai laia chun."
"And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.","A têhai pakhat chu a hung châwm tlei a, Sakeibaknei tuoi a hung na, fâkding man ân chûk a; Mihriemhai chu a fâk zo tah a."
The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.,"Hnamhai khawm chun a chanchin an lo hriet a, An khura chun lâkin a um a; Khaidieta khitin Aigupta rama chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a."
"Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.","A nu chu a nghâk zing a, a beiseina a bo tah ti a hriet a, A te dang a lâk vak a, sakeibaknei tuoiah a siem nâwk a."
"And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.","Sakeibakneihai lai a suk a tungin ân lawn a, Sakeibakneituoi a hung na, fâkding man an chûk a; Mihriemhai chu a fâk zo tah a."
"And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.","An in ropuihai chu a hriet a, an khawpuihai a suksiet a, Ân rûm ri leiin ram chu râusanin a um a, a bitna lai po po le chun."
Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.,"Rambunghaia inthawk sîr tinah hnamhaiin ama an hung kal a, A chungah an lênhai an keiphar a, an khura chun a tla tah a."
"And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.","Kawl inbunin bâwmah an khum a, Babulon lal kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; Kul dettak sûngah an ṭhuoi a, A râwlhai chu Israel tlânghaia inthawk hriet a ni nâwk ta nawna dingin."
"Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.","I nu chu i thisena chun tuihai kâwla phun, grêphrui, Tuihai tam leia ra nuomtak le kâua sip ang a nih."
"And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.","A kâu ngartakhai chu rorêltu lalhmawla hmang an hung nih a, A buk samup laia khawm chun an dâwk lûr bik a; Kâu tamtakhai laiah ân sâng leiin an hmu bîk lûr bawk a."
"But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.","Nisienlakhawm, lunginsenna hmalthlakin a um a, Hnuoia pei thlâkin a um a, Sak thliin a sukṭâwl a, a ra a mût ṭil a, A kâu ngartak khawm chu suktliek a hung na, A vuoi tah a, meiin a kâng hmang tah a."
"And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.","Tuhin chu thlalêrah, Ram ṭâwl le tuihulnaah phunsawn a ni tah."
"And fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.","A kâu kuonghaia inthawk mei a suok a, a ra a kâng hmang zo a, Chuleiin, kâu ngartak rorêlnaa lalhmawla hmang thei khawm a um ta nawh. Hi hi sûnna chu a na, sûnna hla chu la hung nîng a tih."
"And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.","Chun, ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, i kehai chun ngîr la, in- biekpui ka ti che,” a mi tih a."
"And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.","Chun, ka kuoma thu a hril lai chun thlarau chu ka sûnga chun a hung lût a, ka kehai chun a mîn ngîrtir a; chun, ka kuoma thuhriltu chu ka ngai tah a."
"And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.","Ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, Israel thlahai, hnam helhai, keima chunga helhai kuoma chun tir ka ti che; vawisûn ni chen hin, anni le an thlatuhai khawmin ka chungah an bawsiet a nih."
"And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chu thla chu zakmawtak le lungril ngar an na; an kuoma chun ka tir che a ni hi; chun, an kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril i tih, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih,’ tiin."
"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.","Chun, an lo ngai khawma, an lo ngaisak naw khawmin amanih, anni laia zâwlnei a um ti chu hre chêk an tih, (sûngkaw hel an ni sih a)."
"And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.","Chun, nang mihriem naupa, anni chu ṭi naw la, hlo hlingnei le buorhai i kâwla chun umin, ainuvêt laia chun chêng la khawm, an thuhai chu ṭi chuong bawk naw la; sûngkaw hel hmang ni hai sien khawm an thuhaia chun ṭi naw la, an hmêl enin beidawng bawk naw rawh."
"And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.","Chun, an lo ngai khawma, an lo ngaisak naw khawma, an kuoma chun ka thuhai chu hril hrim hrim i ta; hel hmangtak el an ni sih a."
"But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.","Nisienlakhawm, nang mihriem naupa, i kuoma ka hril chu ngai ta; chu sûngkuo hel hmang ang chun hel hmang ni ve naw la; i bau chu ka la, ka pêk che chu fa rawh,” a ta."
"And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;","Chun, ka hang en a, ngai ta, keia tieng hin bân hin a mi hei ban a; chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun lekhabu zuol hi a um a;"
"and he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.","ka hmaa chun a hung phar a, a sûngtieng le a puotienga ziek a na; chutaka chun sûnna le, ṭâna le chungrikna ziek a nih."
"And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.","Kum sarina, thla ngânaa, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun, Israel upa ṭhenkhathai chu LALPA kuoma thu indawn dingin an hung a, ka hmaa chun an ṭhung a."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel upahai kuoma khan thu hril la, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; ka kuomah thu indawn dinga hung in ni maw?

"Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;","Anni chu ro rêlpêk i ti, mihriem naupa, anni chu ro rêlpêk i ti? An thlatuhai tirdakumnahai chu in- hriettir la;"
"and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;","an kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ‘Israel hi ka thlang a, Jakob sûngkaw thlahai chunga chun ka bân ka phar a, Aigupta ramah anni laia kân suk- hmêlhriet nia chun; ka bân ka phar a, LALPA in Pathien ka nih,’ tiin;"
"in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.","chu nia chun Aigupta rama in- thawka, ram po pohai ropuina nenetui le khuoizua luong ram an ta dinga ka lo enthlit tah rama hung ṭhuoi dingin, an kuoma chun ka bân ka phar a."
"And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.","An kuoma khawm chun, a mithmua tirdakumnahai po po chu nangni mi tinin peithla unla, Aigupta ram milimhai chun insukpawrche naw unla; LALPA in Pathien ka ni hi, tiin ka hril a."
"But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.","Nisienlakhawm, ka chungah an hel a, ka thu an ngai nawh a; mi tin chun an mithmua an tirdakumnahai chu an pei thlâk naw bawk a; Aigupta milimhai khawm chu an nghatsan bawk nawh a; chun, kei chun, ‘an chunga chun Aigupta ram sûnga an chunga ka lungsenna sukpuitling dingin ka lunginsenna chu ka bun- thlâk ding a nih,’ ka tih a;"
"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.","nisienlakhawm, ka hming leiin, Aigupta rama inthawk anni hung ṭhuoi suoka an kuoma ka lo intârlang tâkna hmutu, an laia an umna hnam- hai mithmua, hrilsiet ka ni nawna dingin, ka thawh a."
"So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.","chuongchun, Aigupta rama inthawka suok dingin ka siem a, thlalêra chun anni chu ka hung ṭhuoi tah a."
"And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.","Ka thuruothai le ka rorêlhai, chuong chu miin an thawh a, an hring pui dinghai chu, an kuomah ka pêk a, kân entir bawk a."
"Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them.","Chu nawa khawm, ka châwlni chu anni le keia kâra inchikna nih a, anni sukthiengtu LALPA chu ka nih ti an hriet theina dingin ka pêk bawk a."
"But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.","Amiruokchu, Israel sûngkuo chu thlalêra khan ka chungah an hel a, ka thuruotahai chun an fe nawh a, chuong chu miin a thawa a hringna dinghai ka rorêlhai khawm chu an dang kîr a; ka châwlni khawm chu nasatakin an suksiet a, chun, kei chun thlalêra chun anni chu kâng- hmang dingin ka lunginsenna chu an chungah ka bunthlâk ding a nih ka ti tah a."
"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.","Chun, ka hming leiin, hnamhai anni mithmua anni ka hung ṭhuoi- suoknahai, chuonghai mithmua chun hrilsiet a ni ding a ni nawh tiin ka thawh a."
"Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;","Chu nawa khawm, ram po pohai ropuina, nênetui le khuoizua luong anni ka lo pêk ta rama chun anni chu ka ṭhuoi lût naw ding a nih tiin thlalêra khan an kuomah ka bân ka lo phar tah a;"
"because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.","ka rorêlhai chu an dang kîr a, ka thuruothai chu an hraw nawh a, ka châwlnihai chu an bâwsiet ta leiin; an lungrilhai chun an milimhai chu a zui sih a."
"Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.","Nisienlakhawm, anni suksiet- naa inthawk chun ka mit chun a hlah a, thlalêra khan anni chu ka lo suktâwp dêr el bawk nawh a."
"And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.","Chun, an thlahai kuomah thla- lêra khan, ‘In thlatuhai thuruothai chu hraw naw unla, an rorêlhai chu pawm bawk naw unla, an milimhai chun nangni le nangni insukpawrche bawk naw ro;"
"I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;","LALPA in Pathien chu kei ka na, ka thuruothai chu hraw unla, ka rorêlhai chu pawm unla, thaw ro;"
"and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.","ka châwlni khawm chu inza bawk unla; LALPA in Pathien ka nih ti in hriet theina dingin nangni le keia inkâra inchikna nîng a tih,’ tiin."
"But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thlahai chu ka chungah an hel ta rawp a, ka thuruothai chu an hraw nawh a, ka rorêlhai khawm chu thaw dingin an zâwm bawk nawh a; chuong chu miin a thaw chun chuonga chun hring a tih; ka châwlni khawm an sukpawr- cheh a; chun, kei chun thlalêra an chunga ka lunginsenna chu sukpui- tling dingin an chunga chun ka lunginsenna chu ka bunthlâk ding a nih ka tih a."

"As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my wrath upon you.","Tangkaruo chu pûmmeia ân tui angin chuong ang chun chutaka chun intui in tih, chuongchun, kei LALPA hin in chungah ka lunginsenna chu ka hung bunthlâk a nih ti hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a:"
"Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.","“Mihriem naupa, amanu kuoma chun hril la; Ram thienglo le, lungin- senna nia a chunga ruo tlâk nawna ang chu i nih, ti rawh."
"There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.","Sakeibaknei inrûmin a sa fâk ding ân rûm khum angin, a sûnga chun a zâwlneihai chu phierrûkna a um a; mi tin hringin an fâk zo a, thil hluhai le thil rohai chu an lâk a, a sûnga chun hmeithai tamtak an siem a."
"Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.","A thiempuhai chun ka dâna chun thawluina an hmang a; ka thil inthienghai chu an sukpawrche a; thil pângngai le thil inthieng khawm chu an ṭhe hran nawh a, chuongchun, mihai khawm chu thil inthieng le thienglo chu hre hran dingin an siem nawh a; ka châwlnia inthawkin an mithai an hup a; anni laia chun sukhmingsiet ka ni tah a nih."
"Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.","A sûnga a lalhai chu satene an sa fâk ding innghir khumhai ang chu an na; thisen insuoa, mi hring sukbo- hmanga hlâwkna indik lo an hmuna dingin."
"And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah hath not spoken.","Chun, a zâwlneihai chun an kuoma aisân inkhêlhai le, teplohai chu hmuin anni ta ding chun chirhak sukhnâk lo chun an chârkhum a; LALPAIN thu a hril naw sa khawma, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, an tih a."
"The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.","Chu ram mipuihai chun nêk- sâwrna an hmang a, inrûk an chîng bawk a; anih, tlasamhai le mi rimsi- hai chu an suklungngai a; mikhuol chu indik lotakin an nêksâwr a."
"And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.","Anni lai chun mi, ram chu ka suksiet nawna dinga dâi chu siem ṭha ding le, ram ta dinga, ân âwngnaa ka hmaa ngîr ding ka zawng a, nisien- lakhawm, tukhawm ka hmu nawh a,"
"Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuleiin, ka lunginsenna chu an chunga chun ka bunthlâk a, ka lunginsenna mei chun anni chu ka kâng hmang tah a; an lampuihai chu anni lu chunga ngei chun ka hung intlungtir tah a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
"The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a:
"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:","“Mihriem naupa, Nuhmei pahni, nu pakhat naunuhmeihai chu an um a;"
"and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.","Aiguptaa chun nawchizawr sin an thawh a, an tleirâwla inthawkin nawchizawr sin chu an thaw a na, an nênehai chu hmet a na, chuongchun, an nunghâk inthiengna nêne chu hmet zêk a na."
"And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.","An hminghai chu, a upa lem chu Ohola a na, a sangnu chu Oholiba a nih; ka ta an hung ni a, naupasalhai le naunuhmeihai an hung nei tah a. Chun, an hming thua chun Ohola chu Samaria a na, Oholiba chu Jerusalem chu a nih."
"And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,","Chun, Ohola chun ka ta a ni sûng khawm chun nawchi a zawr a; a dit zâwnghai a tuolbâwm Assuria mihai ân saipuia,"
"who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.","a dum pâwla incheihai, ram awp- tuhai le rorêltuhai le tlangvâl ditumtak tak sakawr chung chuong mi sakawr chunga chuonghai chu."
"And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.","An kuoma chun a nawchizawrna chu a pêk a, an rêng chun Assuria mi ditumtak takhai an na, chun, tukhawm ân saipui taphawthai chu, an milimhaia chun ama chu ân suk- pawrche ve pei tah a."
"Neither hath she left her whoredoms since the days of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.","Aiguptaa umna nihaia inthawk ta khan a nawchizawr chu a ma nawh a, a tleirâwl lai an lo zâlpui a; a nunghâk inthieng nêne hmûrhai chu an lo sukhliem ta sih a; chuongchun, an hurna chu a chunga chun an lo bunthlâk tah a."
"Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.","Chuleichun, a hmangaihai kut- ah, a însaipui Assuria mihai kuta chun ka pêk suok tah a."
These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.,"Chuonghai chun a saruokna chu an hlîmpêk a, a naupasalhai le a naunuhmeihai chu an lâkpêk a; ama le chun kâwlhnâmin an that a, ama chu nuhmeihai laia ṭawngnaa hmang a lo ni tah a, ama chunga chun rorêlna chu an lo sukthlûk ta sih a."
"And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.","“Chun, a unaunu Oholiba khawm chun hi hi a hmu zing a, anachu, ama chu a mi insaipuinaa chun ama nêk hin nasatakin ân suksiet lemin, a nawchizawrnaa khawm chun a unau- nu nawchizawrna nêkin a nasa lem a."
"She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.","Ama chun Assuria mihai, ram awptuhai, rorêltuhai, a tuolbâwmhai chu, ropuitaka incheihai, sakawr chung chuong mi sakawr chunga chuonghai, an rênga tlangvâl ditum- tak takhai chu ân saipui a."
And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.,"Chun, ama chu an sukpawrche ti ka hmuh a, an pahni chun lampui thuhmun an hraw leiin."
"And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,","Chun, a nawchizawrna chu a sukzuol pei a, bang chunga chun mihriemhai lim zieka umhai chu a hmu sih a; Kaldaihai lim sen mawia incheia ziek,"
"girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.","an kâwnghaia kâwngkhitnaa inkhit an luhaia lukâwm sukdum kâwma, hang en khawma lalhai ang, an piengna rama Kaldaia Babulon mi nina nei chie ruok an nih."
"And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.","Chun, a hmu phingle chun ama chun ân saipui a; Kaldaia chun an kuomah mitirhai a tir a."
"And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.","Chun, Babulon mi chu a kuoma inditna khuma chun a hung a, an nawchizawrna chun ama chu an sukpawrche a, anni le chun a lo pawr- che tah a, a lungril chun anni chu a ngei ta hle a."
"So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.","Chuongchun, a nawchizawrna chu langchangtaka a thaw a, a saruokna a hlîm chun, ka lungril chu amaa inthawk chun ân her a, a unaunua inthawka ka lungril a lo inher ta ang bawk khan."
"Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.","Nisienlakhawm, Aigupta rama nawchizawr thil a thaw lai, a tleirâwl lai nihai chu hre zingin, a hurnahai chu a la belsa ta rawp a."
"And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.","An tisa khawm sabengtunghai tisa ang, an thilsuok khawm sakawr- hai thilsuok ang, an mi lepchiehai chu ân saipui a."
"Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.","Chuongchun, Aigupta rama i tleirâwl lai nênehai an hmeta, a hmûrhai an hmet zêk lai a, i tleirâwl- lai hurna chu i ngai a."
"Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:","“Chuleiin, Oholiba, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Ngai ta, i dit zâwnghai chu i chungah hung inṭuongtir ka ta; i lungrilin a hran- sanhai chu, sîr tina chun i chungah inhungtir ka tih;"
"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.","Babulon mihai, Kaldai mihai po po le, Pekod mihai, Soa mihai, Hoa mihai, anni le Assuria mihai po po leh; tlangvâl ditumtak takhai, ram awptuhai, rorêltuhai, an rêngin lal nauhai, mi hming inthanghai, an rêngin sakawr chunga chuong mihai chu."
"And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.","Chun, nanga chunga chun hriemhreihai, sakawr tawlailîrhai, tawlailîrhai, mipui inkhâwm nasa- tak leh hung do an ti cheh a; a vêlin, thîr lukhumhai, âwmphawhai le phawhai leh an hung ep ding che a nih; chun, an kuoma chun rorêlna dân ang peiin i chungah rorêlpêk an ti che."
"And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.","I chunga chun ka îtthîkna chu sieng ka ta, i chunga chun lunginsen pumin thâwng an tih; i hnâr le i nahai chu la hmang an ta; i la mahlahai chu kâwlhnâmah tlûng an tih; i naupa- salhai, i naunuhmeihai chu lâng an ta, i la mahlahai chu meiin kâng hmang vawng a tih."
"They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.","Chun, nang khawm i silfênhai chu hlîppêk an ti cheh a, în cheina man tamhai chu la hmang an tih."
"Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.","Chuongchun, Aigupta rama i nawchizawrna hung lâk le, i hurna chu nangmaa inthawka bo ta dingin siem ka ta; chuongchun, anni chu i mithai chun mel ta ngai naw nih a, Aigupta chu hre zing ta bawk naw ti nih."
"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated;","Hieng hin Lalpa PATHIEN chun a ti sih a: Ngai ta, i theidahai kuta le, i lungrilin a hransanhai kuta chun ka pêk suok ding che a nih;"
"and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.","theida hlêng an ti cheh a, i sinthaw inrimna po po chu la hmang vawng an ta, saruok le silfên boin mâksan an ti che; chun, i hurna saruokna chu hlîm nîng a ta, i hurna le i nawchizawrna chu."
"These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols.","Hieng thilhai hi i chungah thawin a um ding a nih; khawhri be mihai hnung chu châkin i lo hnawt tah a, an milimhai chun i lo insuk- pawrche ta si leiin."
Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.,"I unaunu lampuia chun i lo fe tah a; chuleiin, ama no chu i kutah ka pêk ding a nih."
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: I unaunu no tung lientak chu i dâwn ding a nih, Hmusita nuisanin um i ta, hrilinsîm ni bawk i tih, A keng râwn hle sih a;"
"Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.","Lungngaina le inruinain sip tâng i ta, Râusanna le maktina no, i zuorpuinu Samaria no le chun Dâwn khawm dâwn ngei i ta, thlâksuok i ta,"
"Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chutaka a nâwihai chu, sawi i ta, I nênehai chu sukhliem i tih; Ka lo hril ta sih a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Kei i mi lo theinghil tah a, i hnungah i mi pei tah a, chuleiin, i hurna le i nawchizawr- nahai chu nangin phur rawh,” tiin."
"Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations.","Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA chun ka kuomah a hril a, “Mihriem naupa, Ohola le Oholiba chungthu hi i rêl ding am? an tirdakumnahai chu anni hril la."
"For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through the fire unto them to be devoured.","An lo uire ta sih a, an kuthaia chun thisen a kai a; an milimhai chun uiretna thil chu an lo thaw tah a; chun, an naupasalhai an mi neipêk- hai khawm chu, an kuomah fâk zoa um dingin meia chun an infethleng- tir a."
"Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.","Chu naw khawm chu hi hi ka chungah an thaw bawk a; a ni pâng- ngaia ma chun ka hmun inthieng chu an sukpawrcheh a, ka châwlnihai khawm chu an lo bawsiet tah a."
"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.","An milimhai kuoma an nauhai an that laiin, chu nia ma chun ka hmun inthieng chu sukpawrche dingin an hung sih a; chun, ngai ta, ka in sûnga chun chuong ang chun an thaw a nih."
"And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,","Chu nawa chun, hlataka in- thawka hung ding mihai ta ding chun mi i tir a, an kuoma chun mitir chu tir a na; chun, ngai ta, an hung tah a; chuong ta ding chun în sâwp a, i mithai i nâl a, incheinahaiin în chei a;"
"and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil.","lal khum a hmaa dawkân buot- saia um chunga chun i ṭhung a, chu chunga chun ka riminhnikhai le ka hriek chu i sie kha."
"And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them twain, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.","Chun, mipui râwl inhawitihai chu a kuoma chun a um a; chun, mi chi narânhai le chun thlalêra in- thawkin zu inrui mihai chu hung ṭhuoi an na. An kuthaia chun bân- bunhai chu a thuoin an inbuntir a, an luhai chunga chun lallukhum mawi- takhai le chun."
"Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she with them.","Chun, kei chun uirea a upa lemnu kuoma chun, ‘Tuhin anni chun ama le uiretna thil chu an thawin, ama khawma anni leh a thaw ding am aw?’ ka tih a."
"And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.","Nuhmei nawchizawr hlak kuoma an lût hlak angin, anni chu ama kuoma chun an lût tah a; chuongchun, nuhmei hur, Ohola le Oholiba kuoma chun an lût tah a."
"And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.","Mi felhai chun, anni chu uirenu chunga rorêl ang le, nuhmei thisen insuotu chunga rorêl angin rorêlpêk an tih; uirenuhai an na, an kutahai chun thisen a kai bawk si leiin."
"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a; An chungah mipui in- khâwm hung ṭhuoi ka ta, anni chu a suk a tunga vawrlênga suksiet dingin an kuomah pêng ka tih."
"And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.","Chun, mipui inkhâwmhai chun anni chu lungin dêng an ta; an kâwl- hnâmhai chun that an ta; an naupa- salhai le an naunuhmeihai chu that an ta, an inhai chu meiin raw hâwp an tih."
"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.","Chuongchun, hurna chu chu rama inthawka bo dingin siem ka ta, nuhmeihai po po chu in hurna ang thaw lo dinga inchûktir an ni theina dingin."
"And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, in hurna chu in chungah thung an ti cheu a, in milimhai suolna chu phur in ta, chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
"Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Kum kuona kum, thla sâwm- na, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a;"
"Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.","“Mihriem naupa, hi ni hin Babulon lal chun Jerusalem a hung hnai a nih."
"And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:","Chun, sûngkaw hel hmanghai kuoma chun tekhithu hril la, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih: Sumbepui inchuon unla, inchuon unla, A sûnga chun tui buok unla;"
"gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.","Chun, chutaka chun a sa tlinhai thlâk unla, A tlang ṭha deu deuhai, a mal le a dârhai le A ru tuihnâihai chun suksip ro."
"Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the caldron; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.","Ran ruol laia ditumtak chu la unla, A ruhai chu a hnuoi tieng sie unla, Insoṭhattir hle unla, a ruhai chu but ro;"
"Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Khawpui, thisen insuo hmang chu a chung a rik, sum- bepui a tuiêkna a sûnga um le, a tuiêkna khawm bo thei lo chu, a chung a rik! a tlang tlangin la suok rawh, thlang bik nei loin."
"For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.","A thisen chu ama sûnga chun a um sih a, lungpui ruok chunga chun ân suoh a; pilvuta zuk vurkhum theina ding, leihnuoi chunga chun a bunthlâk si nawh a."
"That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.","Phuba la dinga hung tlung dinga lunginsenna chu ân umtir theina dingin, a thisen chu lungpui ruok chunga chun kân suoh a, inkhum a ni nawna dingin."
Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.,"Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Khawpui thisen insuo hmang chu a chung a rik! Kei khawma a thing sep khawm chu suklien ka ta."
"Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.","Thing buk ṭeu la, mei ti chawk ṭha la, sa chu intlawk ṭhattir hle la, a tuihâng chu hâng deuin, a ruhai chu râw hmang ni raw se."
"Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.","Chun, meiling chunga chun a ruokin inchuon la, a hung luma, a dârsen chu a hung inling theina dingin, chuongchun, ân thieng nawna chu a sûnga chun a hung intui theina dingin le, a tuiêkhai chu a hung kâng- hmang theina dingin."
She hath wearied herself with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust goeth not forth by fire.,Sâwl neng khawpa thaw hnung khawmin a tuiêkna chu amaa in- thawk chun a tlan hmang si nawh a; a tuiêkna chu mei khawma a sukbo thei nawh.
"In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.","I pawrchenaa chun hurna a um a; ka sukfai cheh a, sukfaia i um naw leiin, i pawrchenaa inthawkin sukfai ni ngai ta hrim hrim naw ti ni, ka lunginsenna hi i chunga ka suk- lungâwi hmakhat chun."
"I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Kei LALPA chun ka hril tah a, hung tlung ngei a ta, thaw khawm thâwng ka tih, kîr nâwk naw ning a, hla naw nîng a, insîr bawk naw ning; i um dânhai ang pei le i thilthawhai ang peiin ro rêlpêk an ti che, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
"Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung nâwk a:
"Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.","“Mihriem naupa, ngai ta, thâwkkhatin i mithai châkna chu nangmaa inthawkin ka lâk hmang ding a nih; ṭap naw ti nih a, sûn bawk naw ti ni, i mitthlihai khawm luong thla bawk naw ni."
"Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.","Inthuok huoi la, amiruokchu, inring loin, mithi ta ding chun sûnna siem naw la, i lukâwm chu kâwm la, i kehaia chun i kekawkhai chu bun la, i hmûrhai chu hup naw la, lusûntuhai bei chu fa naw rawh,” tiin."
So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.,"Chuongchun, zîngkâr chun mi- puihai kuoma chun thu chu ka hril a, a zântieng chun ka nuhmei chu a thi tah a; chun, thu pêka ka um ang chun zîngkâr chun ka thaw tah a."
"And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?","Chun, mipuihai chun ka kuoma chun, “Hieng thil i thawhai hi, keini ta dingin ieng am an niha i mi hril naw ding maw?” an ta."
"Then I said unto them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Kei chun an kuomah, “LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:"

"Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.","Chu bâkah mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân herhmang a, suol a thaw pha chun, ama hmaa chun tlûkna lung ka sieh a, ama chu thi ngei a tih; ama chu vaulâwkna chu i lo pêk naw leiin, a suolnaa chun thîng a ta; chun, a thil fel thawhai chu hriet zing ni ta naw ni; amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu nangma kutah hung phût ka tih."

"But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.","Nisienlakhawm, vêngtu chun kâwlhnâm hung tlung chu a hmuh a, tawtawrâwt a mût nawh a, mipuihai chu vaulâwk an ni nawh a, kâwlhnâm chu a hung tlung a, anni laia mi tukhawm chu a lâk hmang chun; a suolnaa chu lâk hmang a na; amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu vêngtu kuta chun phût ka tih,’ tiin."
"So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.","Chuongchun, nang mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo ta ding chun vêngtuah ka sie ta che a nih; chuleiin, ka baua thu chu hre la, anni chu keimaa inthawka vaulâwkna chu pe rawh."
"When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.","Mi rilo kuoma chun, ‘Aw mi rilo, i thi ngei ding a nih,’ ka tih a, mi rilo chu a um dân bânsan dinga vau- lâwkna thu i hril si naw chun mi rilo chu ama suolnaa chun thîng a ta, amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu nangmaa chun ka phût ding a nih."
"Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.","Nisienlakhawm, mi rilo chu a um dân bânsan dinga i vaulâwk a, a um dân a bânsan si naw chun, ama chu ama suolnaa chun thîng a ta, nang chun i nun i sanhim nîng a tih."
"And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hieng hin hril rawh, ‘Hieng ang hin in tih a; Ei bâwsietnahai le ei suolnahai chu ei chungah a um a, annia chun ei riral hmang a ni hi, iengtin am hring ei ta?’ tiin."
"Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?","An kuoma chun, ‘Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; mi rilo thinaa chun lâwmna ka nei nawh a; mi rilo chu a um dân a bânsan a, a hring ruok chun lâwmna ka nei a; hung kîr ro, in lampui suola inthawk chun hung kîr ro; aw Israel sûngkuo, iengdingin am thîng in ta?’ ti rawh."
"And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.","Chun, nang mihriem naupa, i chipuihai thlahai kuoma chun hieng hin hril rawh; mi fel felna chun ama chu a bâwsietna nia chun sanhim naw nih a; mi rilo rîtlona thua chun, a rîtlonaa inthawka a hung kîr nia chun a rîtlonaa chun tlu naw nih; chun, mi fel chu a suksuolna nia chun a felnain hring bawk naw nih."

"Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;","Chun, mi rilo kuomah, ‘I thi ngei ding a nih,’ ka ti ve a; ama chu a suolnaa inthawk chun a hung kîr a, ân dik le dân thil chu a thaw chun;"
"if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.","mi rilo chun bathai chu a thung a, inrûka a lâk tahai chu a pêk nâwk a, nun dân thuruot chu a hrawh a, thil a suksuol naw chun, hring ngei ngei a ta, thi naw nih."
None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.,Ama chunga chun thil a lo suksuol tahai hrim hrim a ieng khawm chu hriet zing ni ta naw nih a; ân dik le dân thil chu a lo thaw tâk lei chun a hring ngei ding a nih.
"Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.","Amiruokchu, i chipui thlahai chun, ‘Lalpa lampui chu ân ang vawng nawh a,’ an ti chun, anni chungthua ruok chun, anni lampui chu ân ang vawng naw lem a."
"When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.","Mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân herhmanga thil suol a thaw chun, chutaka chun a thi ngei ding a nih."
"And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.","Chun, mi rilo chu a rîtlonaa inthawka ân her hmanga, ân dik le dân thil chu a thaw chun, chutaka bawk chun hring a tih."
"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.","Amiruokchu, ‘Lalpa lampui chu ân ang vawng nawh,’ in la ti rawp chun, Aw Israel sûngkuo, mi tin chu ama lampuihai ang sengin, a chung- ah rorêl ka tih,” tiin."
"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.","Kan sal intâng a kum sâwmpa- hni kum, thla sâwmna, chu thla ni nga ni chun Jerusalema inthawka hung tlân suok mi pakhat chu ka kuomah a hung a, ka kuomah “Khaw- pui chu suksiet a ni tah,” a hung tih a."
"Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.","Chun, chu hung tlân suok hung hma, zântieng chun LALPA kut chu ka chungah a um a, zîngkâra ka kuoma a hung hma po chun ka bau chu a mîn kâktir a; ka bau chu inkâk- tirin a um a, ṭawng thei loin ka um ta nawh a."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"

"Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.","Hieng hin an kuoma chun hril rawh; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ka hring zing angin, chuong hmun se taha umhai chu kâwl- hnâmah tlûng an ta, rama umhai chu ramsahai kuomah fâk zo dingin ka pêk ding a nih; chun, kul det le pûka umhai chu hripuiin thîng an tih."

"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:"
"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep?","“Mihriem naupa, Israel berâm- puhai chungah thu hril la, thu hril la, berâmpuhai kuom ngeia chun, an kuoma chun hril rawh; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Israel berâmpuhai mâni le mâni inchâwm- tuhai chu an chung a rik de; berâm- puhai chun berâmhai chu an châwm ding a ni naw am a nih?"

"The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them.","A hrât naw chu in sukhrât nawh a, a na khawm chu in sukdam bawk nawh a; a tliek khawm chu in tuom nawh a, khal hmanga um ta khawm chu in hung ṭhuoi nâwk bawk nawh, ân hmang khawm chu in zawng bawk nawh; amiruokchu, thawluina le, hrohrângsetakin an chungah ro in rêl a."

"Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:","Chuleiin, nangni berâmpuhai, LALPA thu chu ngai ta u;"
"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my sheep;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun, Ka hring zing angin ka berâmhai chu, berâm- puhai an um nawh a, ka berâmpuhai chun ka berâmhai chu an zawng bawk nawh a, berâmpuhai chu anni le anni an inchâwm a, ka berâmhai chu an châwm naw leiin, rama ram- sahai po po bu le an sasehai chu an lo ni ngei chu a ni ta hi;"

I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.,"Hlo pet ding ṭhatak chun anni chu châwm ka ta, Israel insângna tlâng chungahai chun an in chu um a tih; in ṭhatak sûnga chun bawk an ta, Israel tlâng chungahai chun hlo petna hmun tuihnâitaka chun tlâng an tih."

"Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;","Hun tâwpa hremna huna, an vângsiet lai hunah Israel thlahai chu kâwlhnâm thilthawtheina kuoma i lo pêk a, anni chu hmêlmâkna rê lo i nei leiin;"

"therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;","nangni Israel tlânghai, Lalpa PATHIEN thu chu lo ngai ta u; Tlâng- hai kuoma dâm, muolhai kuoma dâm, tui luongnahai kuoma dâm, phai- ruom kuoma dâm, khawpui mâksana um le suksieta râusana umhai kuoma dâm, an sîrvêla hnamhai la um sun- hai ifâk zo le hrilsîma lo um tahai kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih;"

"Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of the nations:","“Chuleichun, Israel ram chung- châng thua chun thu hril la, tlânghai kuoma dâm, muolhai kuoma dâm, tui luongnahai kuoma dâm, phairuom- hai kuoma dâm chun hril la; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ngai ta, hnam danghai biekrâwpna chu i lo phur tâk leiin, ka lunginsenna le ka itthîknain thu ka lo hril tah a;"

"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a.
"Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel sûng- kuo chu anni ram ngeia an chêng lai khan, an thil thawhai le an lampuihai chun an sukpawrcheh a; an lampui chu ka kuoma chun nuhmei ân siehran laia ân thieng nawna ang chu a nih."
"Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;","Chuleiin, ram chunga an lo bunthlâk thisen chunga chun ka lunginsenna chu ka bunthlâk a; an milimhaia an lo sukpawrche ta leiin;"

"And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land.","Chun, hnamhai laia an hung chun, an fena tieng tieng ka hming inthieng chu an sukpawrcheh a; chu- taka chun mihai chun, ‘Hienghai hi LALPA mihai chu an na, a rama inthawka suokhai chu an nih,’ an tih a."

"And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.","Chun, ka hming ropuitak chu, hnamhai laia sukpawrchea lo um tah, anni laia in lo sukpawrche ta chu sukthieng ka ta; chuongchun, hnam- hai chun LALPA chu ka nih, ti mi hre tâng an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; an mithmua nangnia sukthienga ka um pha chun."

"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.","Lungril thar pêng ka ti cheu a, thlarau thar nangniah sie bawk ka tih; chun, in tisaa inthawkin lungril lung ang chu la hmang ka ta, tisa lungril innêm pe lem ka ti cheu."

"And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.","In thlatuhai kuoma ram ka pêka chun chêng in ta, nangni chu ka mihai nîng in ta, kei khawm in Pathien nîng ka tih."
"And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.","Chun, in inthiengnawna po poa inthawkin sandam ka ti cheu a, chun, bu ko ka ta, sukpung ka ta, in chung- ah ṭâm inumtir naw ningah."
"And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.","Thing rahai le hnuoi ra hlâwk- hai chu sukpung ka ta, hnamhai laia chun ṭâm leia deusâwna tuok ta ngai naw ti niu."
"Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.","Chun, in lampui rilohai le, in thilthaw ṭha nawhai chu hre zing in ta; chuongchun, in tirdakumnahai le in suolnahai leiin in mithmu ngeia chun nangni le nangni chu inten in tih."
"Nor for your sake do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.","Hi thil hi nangni leia thaw ka ni nawh ti hi nangni ihriet ni raw se, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; aw Israel sûngkuo, in um dânhaia chun buoi unla, inzak ro."
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; In suolnahai po poa in- thawka ka sukthieng ni cheu chun, khawpuihai chu hluoa um dingin siem ka ta, hmun se tahai khawm chu bâwl nîng an tih."
"And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.","A fethlengtuhai mithmua râu- sana a lo um ta angin, ram râusana lo um ta khawm chu inlet nîng a ta."
"And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.","Anni chun, ‘Ram râusana lo um ta hi, Eden huon ang a hung ni nâwk a; khawpui se tah, suksieta um taha râusana um tahai khawm chu hluo an ni tah,’ tîng an tih."

"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Hi hi dinga khawm hin, an ta dinga thawpêk dingin, Israel sûng- kuo mi râwnin um bawk ka tih; anni chu berâm ruol angin mihriem sukpung ka tih."
"As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Inthawina dinga berâm ruol ang, a ruoiṭhena hun bia Jerusalema berâm ruol angin, khawpui se ta- hnunghai chu mihriema suksip nîng an ta, chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
"The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.","LALPA kut chu ka chungah a um a, LALPA thlarau chun a mi ṭhuoi suok a, phairuoma hin a mi sie tah a; rua sip a na;"

"And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, hieng ruhai hi hring thei an ti?” a ta. Chun, “Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, nangin i hriet,” tiin, ka dawn a."
"Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hieng ruhai chunga hin thu hril la, an kuoma chun, ‘Aw nangni ru ṭâwlhai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u,’ ti rawh."
"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.","Hieng ruhai kuoma hin Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, nangniah thuok inlûttir ka ta, hung hring in tih."

"So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.","Chuongchun, thu pêk ka ni ang chun thu chu ka hril tah a; chuonga thu ka hang hril chun ri a hung um a, ngai ta, simkhawlei a hung inhnîng a, ruhai chu mâni zawmpui sengah an hung fe khâwm tah a."
"And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.","Chun, ka hei en a, ngai ta, an chungahai chun thahruihai chu a um a, taksa chu a hung insukbit a, a chunga chun vun chun ân khum tah a; nisienlakhawm, anniahai chun thuok chu a la um nawh a."
"Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Thli kuomah thu hril la, thu hril la, mihriem naupa, thli kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Aw thli, hnuoi kil lia inthawk chun hung la, hieng thata umhai chunga hin hung inthli rawh, an hring theina dingin,’ tiin,” a ta."
"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.","Chuongchun, thu a mi pêk ang chun thu chu ka hril tah a, chun, thli chu annia chun a hung lût a, an hring tah a, an kein, sipai pâwl nasa êm êm el angin an hung ngîr suok tah a."

"Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.","Chuleiin, thu hril la, an kuomah hieng hin ti rawh: Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, in thlânhai chu hung hawng ka ta, in thlânhaia inthawk chun hung in- suoktir ka ti cheu, aw ka mihai; chun, Israel rama chun ṭhuoi ka ti cheu."

"And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.","Chun, ngai ta, in puotienga chun bang chu a vêlin a um a; chu mipa kuta inkhina luonghmawl chu tawng ruka sei a na, tawng khat le kut- phabawk seng a nih; chun, a in sa tieng chu ân khi a, luonghmawl khat a na; ân sâng tieng khawm chu luong- hmawl khat bawk."

"Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, ngai ta, pindanhai le lungpha, a vêla huon sûng tuollai dinga an siem chu a um a; lungpha chunga chun pindan sâwmthum a um a."
"And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.","Lungpha chu dâi kawtkhârhai sîra chun a um a, dâi kawtkhârhai le inchen chie, lungpha hnuoihnung lem chu a nih."
"Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr hnuoi- hnung lema tuolthlâka inthawka, a huon sûng tuollai sûngril lem tuol- thlâk khangtieng chu ân khi a, a saktieng a le a hmârtieng chun tawng za khat ve ve a nih."
"And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.","Chun, a huon sûng tuollai puo lem dâi kawtkhâr, hmârtienga ngha chu, a chu dungtieng le chu khang- tieng chu ân khi a."
"And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.","Chun, vêngna pindanhai chu hi tieng sîrah pathum, khingtieng sîrah pathum bawk a nih; chun, a kawt- khâr bienghai le a tuolpûkhai chu a dâi kawtkhâr pakhatna tie seng chu a na; a dung tieng chu tawng sâwmnga a na, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwm- hni panga."
"And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.","A tukverhai le, a tuolpûk le, chutaka intûm thinghai chu, sak- tieng panga ngha dâi kawtkhâra mi tie seng kha an nih; chun, sirbi pa- sariin a hang tlung a, chun, tuolpûk chu sûngtienga chun a um a."
"And there was a gate to the inner court over against the other gate, both on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr dang zâwn- a chun, tuollai sûng sûngril lema dinga dâi kawtkhârhai a um a; sak- tieng panga le hmârtieng panga chun dâi kawtkhâra inthawka dâi kawt- khâr chen chun tawng za khatin ân khi a."
"And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.","Chun, sim tieng panga chun a mi ṭhuoi a, simtienga dâi kawtkhâr chu ka hmuh a, chuongchun, hi inkhina dân ang pei hin chutaka a kawtkhâr bienghai le a tuolpûkhai chu ân khi a."
"And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.","Khâng tukverhai ang bawk kha, a keikul haia le chun chu- taka chun tukverhai a um a, a seizie chu tawng sâwmnga a na, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhni panga a nih."
"And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.","Chun, a hang kaina dinga chun sirbi pasari a um a; a tuolpûkhai chu chuonghai hmaa chun a um a; chun, chutaka a kawtkhâr bienghai chunga chun intûm thinghai, hi tiengah pakhat, khing tiengah pakhat bawk a um a."
And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.,"Chun, simtieng panga chun a huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema dâi kawtkhâr chu a um a; chun, sim- tienga a dâi kawtkhâra inthawka dâi kawtkhâr chu tawng za khatin ân khi a."
Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;,"Chun, simtienga dâi kawtkhâra chun huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a; hieng inkhina dân hin simtienga dâi kawtkhâr chu ân khih a;"

"And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.","Chun, a vêlin tuolpûkhai tawng sâwmhni pangaa sei, tawng ngaa lien a um a."
And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.,"Chun, a tuolpûkhai chun huon sûng tuollai puo lem tieng a nghaa, a kawtkhâr bienghai chunga chun in- tûm thinghai an um a; a hang kainaa chun kailâwn pariet a um a."
And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;,"Chun, saktieng panga huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, hieng inkhina ang pei hin dâi kawtkhâr chu ân khi a,"

"And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.","A tuolpûkhai chun huon sûng tuollai puo lem tieng a ngha a, a kawtkhâr bienghaia chun, hi tieng le khing tienga khawm intûm thinghai an um a, chun a hang kaina chu sirbi pariet a nih."
And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured it according to these measures;,"Chun, hmâr tieng dâi kawt- khâra chun a mi ṭhuoi a; ama chun hieng inkhina dân ang hin ân khi a;"
"the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.","a vêngna pindanhai, a kawt- khâr bienghai, a tuolpûkhai chu; chun, chutaka chun a vêlin tukverhai a um a, a dung tieng chu tawng sâwmnga, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhni panga a nih."
"And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.","Chun, kawtkhâr bienghai chu huon sûng tuollai puo lem tienga chun a na, chun, chutaka kawtkhâr bienghaia chun, hi tieng sîra le khing tieng sîra khawm chun intûm thing- hai an um a; a hang fe kaina chu sirbi pariet a nih:"
And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.,"Chun, dâi kawtkhârhaia kawt- khâr bienghai sîra chun pindan le kawtkhârhai an um a; chutaka chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an sâwp hlak."
"And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk lûtnaa chun, hi tieng sîrah dawkân pahni, khing tieng sîrah dawkân pahni bawk, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân dâm, suol thilinhlân dâm, baw- sietna thilinhlân dâm thatna dingin a um a."
"And on the one side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.","Chun, hmârtieng dâi kawt- khâra lûtnaa hang feh a, sîr khat a puotienga chun, dawkân pahni a um a; chun, a sîr khata chun, dâi kawt- khâra tuolpûka ṭhangsaa chun dawkân pahni bawk a um a."
"Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew the sacrifices.","Hi tieng sîrah dawkân pali, khingtieng sirah dawkân pali bawk; dâi kawtkhâr sîra chun an um a; chuong dawkân pariethai chunga chun inthâwinahai chu an that hlak."
"And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânna dingin lung a saka sak, tawng khat le a chenvea sei, tawng khat le a chenvea lien, tawng khata insâng dawkân pali an um a; chuong chunga chun inthawina le pumrawhmang thilinhlân ding an thatna ding hriemhreihai chu an sie a."
"And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.","Chun, in sûnga chun a vêlin kuoikimhai kutpha bawka lienhai chu inbûk an na; chun, dawkânhai chunga chun inthâwina sa chu a um a."
"And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr sûngril lem puoa chun a mi ṭhuoi lût a; Ngai ta, pindan pahni huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema chun an um a; hmar- tieng kawtkhâr bula chu a nghat dân chu sim sawng a na, simtieng dâi kawtkhâr sîra pakhat chu a nghat dân hmâr sawng a nih."
"And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hi pindan, a nghat dân sim sawng hi in enkawl sin kawltu thiempuhai ta ding a nih."
"and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.","Pindan a nghat dân hmar sawng hi thiempuhai, mâichâmhai sin enkawlna kawltuhai ta ding chu a nih; chuonghai chu Zadok naupasal- hai, chuonghai chu Levi naupasalhai laia ama rawng bâwl dinga LALPA kuom hnaia hunghai chu an nih."
"And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai chu ân khih a, tawng zaa sei, tawng zaa lien, kil li inchen a nih; chun, mâichâm chu in tuola chun a um a."
"Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.","Chun, in tuolpûka chun a mi ṭhuoi a, tuolpûk kawtkhâr bienghai chu ân khih a, hi tieng sîrah tawng nga, khing tieng sîrah tawng nga bawk; chun, kawtkhâr khingtieng chu hi tieng sîrah tawng thum, khing tieng sîrah tawng thum bawk a nih."
"The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.","Chun, tuolpûk seizie chu tawng sâwmhni a na, a lien tieng chu tawng sâwmpahni a nih; chun, an hang kainaa chun sirbi sâwm a um a; chun, kawtkhâr bieng sîrhaia chun sût- puihai a um a, hi tieng sîrah pakhat, khing tieng sîrah pakhat bawk."
"And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.","Chun, ama chun Pathien biek ina chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, kawtkhâr bieng chu ân khi a, hi tieng sîrah tawng ruka lien a na, khing tieng sîra khawm tawng ruka lien bawk a nih; chu chu biekbûk khang tieng ruol a nih."
"And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.","A lûtna khang tieng chu tawng sâwm a na; lûtna sîr chu sîr khatah tawng nga a na, sîr danga khawm tawng nga bawk a nih; chun, chu dung tieng chu tawng sâwmliin ân khi a, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhniin."
"Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.","Chun, a sûngah a lût a, lûtna kawtkhâr bieng chu tawng hniin ân khi a; a lûtna chu tawng rukin; a lûtna khang tieng chu tawng sariin."
"And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.","Chun, pindan chu ân khi a, a dung tieng chu tawng sâwmhniin ân khi a, a khang tieng khawm tawng sâwmhni bawkin; chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hi hi hmun inthiengtak chu a nih,” a ta."
"Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.","Chun, in bang chu ân khi a, tawng ruk a na, sîr tinah a in vêl chun, pindan kêmhai khang tieng chu tawng li pei a na."
"And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house.","A sîr pindanhai chu pathum a na, pakhat chungah a dang, chuong ang peia sâwmthum chena indawt peiin; Inpui banga chun inbûkna nei loa, chutaka chun inbûkna an nei thei lemna dingin, a vêla pindan kêmhai ta ding hrima ruot inpui banga filawrhaia chun an vân bûk a."
And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.,"Pindan kêmhai chun in chu an vêl sâng deu deu chun an lien deu deu a; in sîr vêl chun a pindan inzâwnpui ang peiin a lien tung pei a; chuong- chun, in vêlin a sûngpui chu a chin deu deu pei a, in sîra chun leilâk a fe tung pei a; chuongchun, mi chun pindan hnuoihnung taka inthawka a chunghnung taka chun pindan lai- lung hraw tlangin a fe a nih."
I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.,"Chun, in chun a vêlin a rei sukkho a nei ka hmu bawk a; chun, pindan kêmhai lungphûmhai chu luonghmawl tling tawng ruk a nih."
"The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.","Chun, pindan kêmhai bang sazie chu a puotiengah tawng nga a nih; chun, chutaka la mahla chu pindan kêmhai a sûnga umhai sîr thlâk chu a la nih."
And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.,"Chun, inpui lungrem le pindan kêmhai inkâr chu sîr tinah a in vêl suokin, tawng sâwmhnia lien a um a."
"And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.","Chun, pindan kêmhai kawt- khârhai chu chu hmun la âwl tieng- haia chun hawng a na, kawtkhâr pakhat chu hmârtiengah, kawtkhâr dang chu simtiengah; chun, chu hmun la chuonga ngai khang tieng chu tawng nga a nih a vêlin."
"And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.","Chun, in thlangtieng panga hmun âwl hmaa in chu tawng sâwm- saria lien a na; chun, chu in chu a bang sazie chu a vêlin tawng ngaa sa a nih, a dung tieng chu tawng sâwm- kuo a nih."
"So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;","Chun, in chu tawng zaa seiin ân khi a; chun, hmun daidana um le a in le, chutaka banghai le chun tawng za chu a nih;"
"also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.","chun, in hmai khang tieng saktieng panga hmun âwla um chu tawng za a nih."
"And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;","Chun, chu hnungtienga um hmun âwla in seizie chu ân khi a; chutaka a dawdanhai le, sîr khat le sîr khingtienga dawdanhai le chun tawng za a nih; chun, biekin sûngril lem, huon sûng tuollaia tuolpûkhai, a kawtkhâr bienghai, thingphêka in- thuo a na;"
"the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows (now the windows were covered),","a tukver inkhâr zinghai, a sâwng thuma a dawdanhai a vêlin a um a; a inpui kawt lûtnaa inthawk, a vêla thingphêka remin ṭuonga in- thawka tukver chen rem a nih;"
"to the space above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.","chuongchun, tukverhai chu in- thuo an na; kawtkhâr lu chung hmun, in sûngril lem le puo lem, a vêlin a puo le sûngah banghai chun, inkhi thlapa inkhum a nih."
"And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;","Chun, cherubhai le intûm thinghaia chei a na; intûm thing chu cherub le cherub inkâra chun a um a, chun, cherubhai chun hmai pahni seng an nei a;"
"so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. Thus was it made through all the house round about:","chuongchun, sîr khata chun in- tûm thing tieng chun mihriem hmai chu a nghah a, chun, sîr khingtienga chun intûm thing tieng ngha ma chun sakeibaknei tuoi hmai chu a ngha a; in chu a vêlin chuong ang taka siem suok vawng chu a nih."
from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made; thus was the wall of the temple.,Hnuoia inthawka kawtkhâr lu chung chen chun cherubhai le intûm thinghaia siem a na; biekin bang chu chuong ang chu a nih.
"As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple.","Biekin thua chun, a kawtkhâr bienghai chu kil li nei an na; chun, hmun inthieng tak hmaa chun, thinga siem mâichâm ang a um a."
"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.","Chun, mâichâm chu thing a na, ân sâng tieng chu tawng thum a na, a sei tieng chu tawng hni a nih; a kihai le, a mawnghai le a banghai chu thing ruok a nih; chun, ama chun ka kuom- ah, “Hi hi LALPA hmaa dawkân chu a nih,” a tih a."
And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.,"Chun, biekin le hmun inthieng tak chun kawtkhâr pahni a nei a."
"And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves: two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other.","Kawtkhârhai chun, phêk hran pahni, phêk hni inthlep a nei a, kawtkhâr pakhat ta dingin, phêk hni, kawtkhâr dang ta dingin phêk hni bawk."
"And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.","Chun, an chunga chun, biekin sûtpui kawtkhârhaia chun cherubhai le intûm thinghai lim siem an na, bang chunghaia siem ang bawk khan; chun, tuolpûk puotieng hmaa chun thingpum lientak tak a um a."
"And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.","Chun, tukver inkhârhai le, tuol- pûka chun sîr khata le sîr khing- tienga khawm chun intûm thinghai chu an um a; pindan kêmhai le thing- phêk satakhai chu chuong ang chu a nih."
"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.","Chun, hmârtieng lampuia, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun a mi ṭhuoi suok a; hmârtieng panga in zâwna um, hmun daidan epa pindan kêma chun a mi ṭhuoi lût a."
"Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.",Hmartieng panga pindan chu a sei tieng tawng za khat a na; a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmnga a nih.
"Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.","Huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema ṭhang tawng sâwmhni zâwna le, huon sûng tuollai puo lem epa lungpha zâwna chun dawdan inep ṭhieuin sâwng thumin a um a."
"And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits’ breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.","Chun, pindanhai hmaa chun, sûnglûtin inlawnna tawng sâwma lien, tawng za khata sei a um a; chun, an kawtkhârhai chu hmar sawng an nih."
"Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.","Chun, pindan chunghnung lem- hai chu an tawi lem a; dawdanhai chun a hnuoihnung le a laitak nêkin ina chun hmun an aw lien lem sih a."
"For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.","Sâwng thum an ni sih a; huon sûng tuollaia sûtpuihai ang kha sûtpui an nei ve nawh a; chuleiin, a chunghnung tak chu a hnuoia nêkin ân têp a, a hnuoihnung tak nêkin a lailung chu ân têp lem a."
"And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.","Pindan kêmhai zâwn pei puoah, tuollai puo lem tiengah pindanhai epa ân huonna chu tawng sâwmngaa sei a nih."
"For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.","Huon sûng tuollai puo lema pin- dan chu a dung tieng tawng sâwmnga an ni sih a; chun, ngai ta, biekin tuola chun tawng za khat a nih."
"And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.","Hieng pindanhai hnuoia hin saktieng pangah lûtna a um a, huon sûng tuollai puo lema inthawka lûtna chu."
"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.",Chutaka chun puo tieng bang ân ṭan a. Simtienga khawm huon sûng tuollai le inepa chun pindanhai an um bawk a.
"And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.","An hmaa lampui chu hmâr- tienga pindanhai lampui ang bawk kha a na; an seizie le a khang tieng khawm ân ang; a suokna lampuihai le an rem dân dâm, a kawtkhârhai chenin ân ang vawng a nih."
"And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.","Simtieng panga pindanhai hnuoia chun saktieng pangah lûtna a um a, chu chu fe thlengna lampui chu a nih. Chuonghai epa chun pindanna bang a um a."
"Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Hmârtienga pindanhai le simtienga pindanhai, hmun âwl hmaa umhai hi, pindan inthieng, thiempu LALPA hnaituhaiin thil inthiengtakhai an fâkna ding a nih; chutaka chun thil inthiengtakhai chau chu sieng an tih, bu thilinhlân dâm, suol thilinhlân dâm, bawsietna thilinhlân dâm chu; chu hmun chu ân thieng sih a."
"When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.","Thiempuhai chu an lût pha chun, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun hmun inthienga inthawk chun an fe suok ding a ni nawh a, ami- ruokchu, chutaka chun, an rawng- bâwlnaa chun an silfênhai sieng an ta; an inthieng sih a; silfên dangin inbel an ta, chun, mipui tieng chu an hung hnai chau ding a nih,” a ta."
"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.","Chun, in sûngril lem chu inkhi zo hnung chun, dâi kawtkhâr, sak- tieng nghaa chun a mi ṭhuoi suok a, chun, a vêl chun ân khi tah a."
"He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.","Inkhina luonghmawl chun sak- tieng chu ân khi a, inkhina luong- hmawl chun a vêlin tawng za nga a nih."
He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.,"Chun, hmârtienga khawm chun a vêlin, inkhina luonghmawl chun tawng za ngain ân khi bawk a."
He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.,"Inkhina luonghmawl chun, sim- tieng pang khawm chu tawng za ngain ân khi a."
"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.","Chun, thlang tieng chu ân khi nâwk a, inkhina luonghmawl chun tawng za ngain ân khi a."

"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih: In vêla hnam umhai nêkin in buoi ngun lem a, ka thuruothai in zâwm bawk nawh a, ka rorêlhai in pawm bawk nawh a, in vêla hnamhai dân ang chun in thaw bawk naw leiin;"
"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee; and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih: Ngai ta u, kei hin, kei ngei hin ka dodâl cheu a nih; hnamhai mithmua ngei chun nangmaa chun rorêlna chu ka hung tirsuok ding a nih."

"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on thee; and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.","Chuongchun, i sûnga chun pa- hai chun naupahai chu fâng an ta, naupahai chun an pahai chu fa bawk an tih; chun, nangmaa chun rorêl chu hung sukthlûng ka ta, nangmaa la mahlahai po po khawm chu thedar vawng ka tih."
"Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.","Chuleiin, ka hring zing angin, i tirdakumna po po le i thilpawrchehai po po chun ka hmun inthieng chu i lo sukpawrche tâk leiin hung sukriral ngei ngei ka ti che a, ka mit khawma hla naw ni cheh a, kei khawma lunginsietna nei bawk naw ning che."
"A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.","Nanga hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu hripuiin thîng an ta, i sûnga chun ṭâmnaa fâkzoin um an tih; chun, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu i vêla chun kâwlhnâmah tlûng an ta; chun, a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu the dar ka ta, an hnunga chun kâwlhnâm keidawk ka tih."
"Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted: and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.","“Chuongchun, ka lunginsenna chu sukpuitling ni tâng a ta, ka lung inthakna chu an chunga chun suktlai tâng ka ta, inhawi ti tâng ka tih; chun, an chunga ka lung inthakna ka sukpuitling pha chun kei LALPA hin ṭhahnemngaia ka lo hril a ni ti hre tâng an tih."
"Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.","Chu nawa khawm chun, i vêla hnamhaia le, nang hung fe khêltu- hai po po che mithmua chun râusana le mi ṭawngdawngah siem ka ti cheh a."
"So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes (I, Jehovah, have spoken it);","Chuongchun, vauna ṭiumhai le, lunginthak le lunginsennaa rorêlna- hai ka hung suktlung pha chun, i vêla hnam umhai ta ding chun makti ding le, inchûkna ding le, hrânghla le, invaunaa hmang la nîng a tih, kei LALPA hin ka hril tah a nih:"
"when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;","chu pha chun, an chunga chun ṭâmna thal ṭha nawhai chu sukbo- hmangna dingin, anni sukbohmang- na dinga ka hung tir ding chu, hung tir ka ta, beia in ringsan khawm chu suktliek ka ta;"

"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them,","“Mihriem naupa, i hmai kha Israel tlâng tiengahai sawn innghat la, an kuomah thu hril la,"
"and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.","‘Nangni Israel tlânghai, Lalpa PATHIEN thu chu lo ngai ta u, Lalpa PATHIEN chun tlânghai le muol- hai le, tui luongnahai le, phairuom- hai kuoma chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ngai ta u, keiin, keima ngeiin, in chungah kâwlhnâm intlungtir ka ta, in bâwlhmunhai sukse vawng ka tih."
"And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.","In mâichâmhai chu râusan hung nîng an ta, in nisa milimhai khawm chu suktliek nîng a ta, in mi thathai chu in milimhai hmaa chun hung pei thlâng ka tih."
And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.,"Chun, Israel thlahai thiruonghai chu an milimhai hmaa chun sieng ka ta; in ruhai chu in mâichâmhai vêla chun the dar ka tih."
"In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished.","In chêngna hmunhaia po po chun khawpuihai chu suksiet nîng an ta, bâwlhmunhai chu râusan nîng an ta; in mâichâmhai chu râusan le suksiet a ni theina ding le in milimhai chu suktliek le suktâwp a nia, in nisa- milimhai chu phûr thlûk a na, in sinthawhai chu suktâwp a ni theina dingin."
"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, thata umhai chu nangni lai ngei tlûng an ta, chun, LALPA ka ni mi hre tâng in tih."
"Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.","Amiruokchu, ṭhenkhat la hlâng ka ta, ramhaia sukdara in um pha chun, hnamhai laia chun ṭhen- khat chun kâwlhnâm chu pumpel in tih."
"And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.","Chun, nangni laia chuonga suok- hai chun, hnamhai sala ṭhuoia an umnahai laia an um lai chun mi hre zing an ta, an lungril keimaa in- thawka ṭhea um tah, châkna chu ka lo sukkawi ta zie hai le, an mithai an milimhai châktaka an enna le chun; chun, anni an tirdakumna po poa an lo thaw tah, thil ṭha naw ta ding chun an mithmu ngeia chun intirdak an tih."

"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, “I kut ben la, i kein sir la, chun, Ehei!

He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.,"Hlataka umhai chu hripuiin thîng an ta; a hnaia umhai chu kâwl- hnâmah tlûng an ta, chun, umhmuna uma inhuol khuma um chu ṭâmin thîng a tih: chuong ang chun ka lungsenna chu an chunga chun ka sukpuitling ding a nih."
"And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.","Chun, an mi thathai chu an mâichâm vêla an milimhai laia a um a, muol insâng tina dâm, tlâng sâng sîp tinahai dâm, thing hring tin hnuoiahai dâm, thingsaisuo lien hnuoi tinahai dâm, an milimhai kuoma riminhnik an inhlânnahai po poa chun an um pha chun LALPA ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih."

"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chu nawa khawm, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"

"Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, upon the mountains.","Aw ram hluotu, i chungrikna chu a hung tlung tah; a hun chu a hung tlung a, a ni chu a hnai tah, tlâng chunghaia hlimna khêk rihai ni loin, buoina ni chu."

"They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.","An tangkahai chu kawtthlêr- haia chun dehâwn an ta, an râng- kachakhai khawm chu thil thieng naw ang hung nîng a tih; an tangka le rângkachak chun LALPA lungin- senna nia chun anni chu sansuok naw nih a; an lungril chu suktlaiin, an phîng khawm chu sukkhawp bawk naw ni hai, an suolnaa tlûkna lung a ni tâk leiin."
"As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.","An incheina mawina chu inlal- saknân an hmang a; nisienlakhawm, an tirdakumna limhai chu an siemin, an pawrchena thilhai limhai le chun; chuleiin, an ta ding chun thil thieng- nawah ka siem tah a nih."
"And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.","Man dingin ramdang mihai kut- ah pêng ka ta, mi rilohai kuomah râllâk dingin; chuongchun, sukpawr- chêng an tih."
"My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.","Ka hmai chu an kuoma in- thawkin la hmang ka ta, ka hmun inthieng chu sukpawrchêng an tih; inru hmanghai chu a sûngah lût an ta, sukpawrchêng an tih;"
"Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.","Khaidiet chu siem rawh; ram chu thisen insuo thusiein a sip a, khawpui sûng chu inpâwngnêknain a sip sih a."
"Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.","Chuleichun, awi naw mi ṭha nawtakhai chu hung ṭhuoi ka ta, an inhai chu neipêk an tih; mi hrâthai chapona chu suktâwp bawk ka ta; chun, an hmun inthienghai chu sukpawrche nîng an tih."
"Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.","Bohmangna chu a hung tlung mêk a, inremna chu zawng an tih; anachu um naw ni."
"Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.","Sietna chunga siet nâwk zuolna hung tlung a ta, thuthang chunga chun thuthang um a ta; chun, zâwlnei thilhmulâwkhai chu zawng an ta, nisienlakhawm, thiempua inthawkin dân le, mi hluihaia inthawkin thu- râwn chu bohmang tâng a tih."
"The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Lal chu lusûnin um a ta, hotu khawm chu beidawngnain inthuom a tih; chun, rama mipuihai kuthai chu sukbuoi nîng a ta; an um dânhai ang peiin an chungah thâwng ka tih; chun, an ngaithana ang peiin rorêl- pêk ka ta; chun, LALPA ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.","Chun, kum ruknaa thla ruknaa, chu thla ni nga ni chun, ka ina chun ka ṭhung a, ka hmaa chun Juda upahai an ṭhung laiin, Lalpa PATHIEN kut chu chutaka chun ka chunga chun a um tah a."
"Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.","Chun, ka en a, mei inlang anga inlang hi ka hmuh a; a kâwng le hnuoitieng inlang dân chu mei a na, a kâwng le a chungtieng inlang dân chu var ang, ṭhihna zie ang a na."
"And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.","Chun, kut ang tak hi a hang ban suok a, ka samtawma chun a mi man a, chuongchun, thlarau chun vân le hnuoi kâra chun a mi dawm kâng a, Pathien thil hmulâwknahai chun Jerusalemah, tuolsûng sûngril lem dâi kawtkhâr hmâr tieng sawnga chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a; chutaka chun îtthîkna milim, îtthîk dinga chawk- tho hlaktu ṭhungpha chu a um a."
"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.","Chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun phaia ka hmu ta ang tak khan, Israel Pathien ropuina chu a um a."
"Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, i mit khan hmâr tieng hang en rawh,” a mi tih a. Chuongchun, hmâr tieng ka mit chun ka hei en a, mâichâm kawtkhâr hmâr tieng panga chun a lûtnaah îtthîkna milim chu ka hmuh a."
"And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, an ithaw saw i hmu am? Hitaka hin Israel sûngkuo chun tirdakumna nasatak el an lo thaw tah a, ka hmun inthienga inthawka hlataka ka fe hmang hielna dingin; amiruokchu, tirdakumna nasa nâwk zuol chu i la hmu ding a nih,” a tih a."
"And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.","Chun, tuolsûng tuollai kawt- khâra chun a mi ṭhuoi a; chun, ka hei en chun, banga chun âwng ka hmu tah a."
"Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, tuhin bang kha hang ker rawh,” a ta. Chun, bang ka hei ker chun, kawtkhâr ka hmuh a."
"And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Va lût la, hitaka tirdakumna suoltak an thaw chu va en rawh,” a ta."
"So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.","Chuongchun, ka va lût a, ka va en a, ngai ta, thilhring bawka invâk chi tinrênghai, ramsa tirdakumhai le, Israel sûngkuo milimhai po po chu bang chunga chun a vêla limziekin ka hmuh a."
"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.","An hmaa chun Israel sûngkuoa upahai sâwmsari an ngîr a, anni laia chun Saphan naupa Jaazania chu a ngîr a, mi tin chun an kutah rimin- hnik râwna thlêng an chawi seng a; chuongchun, riminhnik khu rim chu a hang feh a."
"Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, mi tin mâni milim pindan chitah, Israel sûngkaw upa- hai chun inthim hnuoia chun ieng am an thawh a, i hmu am? Anni chun, ‘LALPA chun a mi hmu nawh, LALPA chun hnuoi hi a nghatsan tah,’ an tih a,” tiin."
"He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Tirdak- umna an thaw nasatak dang khawm la hmûng i tih,” a ti bawk a."
"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah’s house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.","Chun, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr hmârtienga uma chun a mi ṭhuoi a; chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun nuhmeihai Tammuz ṭain an lo ṭhung a."
"Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Aw mihriem naupa, hi hi i hmu am? Hieng nêka tirdakumna nasa lem la hmu nâwk i tih,” a ta."
"And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah’s house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.","Chun, LALPA in tuollai sûngril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a, chun, ngai ta, LALPA biekin kawtkhâr, mâichâm le a tuolpûk inkâra chun mi sâwmhni panga, LALPA biekin chu an hnungtieng innghata, an hmai- hai chu khawsak tieng nghain an um a; saktienga nisa chu chibai an bûk a."
"Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Aw mihriem naupa, hi hi i hmu am? Tirdakumna hitaka an lo thaw ta hi, Juda sûngkaw ta ding chun thil chîn tham am a nih? Ram chu inpâwngnêknain an suksip a, lung- insen dingin an mi chawktho nâwk a, en ta, an hnârah sâwlhna an sie a."
"Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.","Chuleiin, kei khawma lungin- senin thaw vêng ka ta, ka mitin anni chu hla naw nih a, lunginsietna nei bawk naw ning; ka naa chun râwl inringtakin hung khêk hai sien- khawm, anni chu lo ngai naw ning,” tiin."
"Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.","Chun, râwl inringtakin ka naa chun a hung khêk a, “Mi tinin mâni suksietna hriemhrei a kuta chawiin, khawpui enkawltuhai chu hung inhnaitir rawh,” a ta."
"And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.","Chun, ngai ta, hmârtienga um, dâi kawtkhâr chunghnung lema chun mi paruk, mi tinin mâni sukhlumna hriemhrei chu kuta chawiin an hung a; anni laia pakhat chu puon zai inhmiin ân chei a, a kâwngah lekhaziektu lekhatui bûr a pai a. Chun, anni chu an va lût a, dârsen mâichâm bula chun an ngîr tah a."
"And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.","Chun, Israel Pathien ropuina chu, a umna hmuna inthawk chun in kawtkhâr bula chun a hang feh a; chun, mi puon zai inhmia inchei a, a kâwnga lekhaziektu lekhatuibûr neitu chu a ko tah a."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.","Chun, LALPA chun a kuoma chun, “Khawpui laia chun, Jerusalem laia chun fe suok la, chu sûnga tirdak- umnahai thawa um tahai po po leia khêk a, thuokdawnghai mi chuonghai bâwkhaia chun inchikna sie rawh,” a tih a."
"And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;","Chun, mi dang kuoma khawm keia hrieta chun, “Ama hnunga chun khawpui chu va fang la, va sukhlum rawh; i mitin hla naw sienla, lungin- sietna nei bawk naw rawh;"
"slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.","putarhai, tlangvâlhai, nunghâk- hai, naupangtêhai, nuhmeihai chu that fairêt rawh; amiruokchu, mi a chunga inchikna um chu hung hnai naw la; chun, ka hmun inthienga chun ṭan rawh,” tiin. Chun, biekin tuola um mi upahaia chun an ṭan tah a."
"And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “In chu sukpawrche unla, tuollaihai chu mi thathai chun suksip ro; fe ro le,” a ta, chun, an fe suok a, khawpuia chun an that tah a."
"And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?","Chun, an that zing lai chun keia khâta mâksanin ka um a, ka hmaia hnuoi sikin ka bawkkhup a, ka khêk a, “A, Lalpa PATHIEN! Jerusalem chunga i lunginsenna i bunthlâka hin Israel la um sunhai po po chu i suk- bohmang vawng ding am a nih?” ka tih a."
"Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting of judgment: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Juda le Israel sûngkaw suolna chu a nasa êm êm a, ram chu thisenin a sip a, khawpui sûng chu rorêlna pawisak nawnain a sip a, ‘LALPA chun ram hi a nghatsan tah a, LALPA chun a hmu nawh,’ an ti sih a."
"And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.","Chuongchun, keia ta ding khawma, ka mitin hla naw nih a, lunginsietna nei bawk naw ning, ami- ruokchu, an suol man chu an lu chungah innghat lem ka tih,” a ta."
"And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.","Chun, ngai ta, mi puon zai in- hmia inchei a, a kâwnga lekhatuibûr neitu khan thu chu a hung hrilsâwng a, “Nangin thu i mi pêk ang tak khan ka thaw tah,” tiin."
