"I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.","“Mihriem le sa khawm sukbo- hmang ka ta, chunglêng vatehai le, tuisuorieta ngahai le mi khawhlohai insuithlûktir ka ta; chun, sukbo- hmang vawng ka ta; chun, leihnuoi chunga inthawk hin mihriem chu sât thlâng ka tih,” LALPA chun a tih."
"And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests;","“Juda le Jerusalema chênghai po po chunga chun ka kut phar ka ta; thiempuhai laia milim bie hmingput le, Baal milim la um sunhai chu hi hmuna inthawk hin pei thlâng ka tih;"

"And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.","Chun, chu ni chun hlêmna le nunsietna leia an hotuhai in suksip hlaktuhai, hrizâwl chunga inchâwm hlakhai chu hrem bawk ka tih."
"And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.","Chun, chu ni chun nga kawt- khâra inthawk chun khêk ri nasatak um a ta, muolhaia inthawka kawi- hâwp ri nasatak le Misneha in- thawka ṭap inrûm ri nasatak um bawk a tih, LALPAIN a tih."

"And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.","Chuong huna chun, Jerusalem chu khâwnvarhai sitin dap ka ta, mi an in kilkhâwrhaia chêng a, an lung- rila, “LALPA chun thil ṭha thaw naw nih a, thil ṭha naw khawm thaw chuong hliek naw ni,” tituhai chu hrem ka tih."

"The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.","LALPA ni ropuitak chu a hnai tah a, LALPA ni râwlri ngei chu a hnai tah a, a tlung ṭêp a nih; chu huna chun mi thilthawtheitak chu rinumti- takin a khêk a nih."
"That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,","Chu ni chu lunginsenna ni, buoina le rinumna ni a na, sietna le sukrêmna ni, inthimna le lungzîngna ni, sûm zîngna le inthim sâmup ni,"

"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.","LALPA lunginsenna nia chun an tangkain amanih, an rângkachak- in amani khawm sansuok thei naw nih a; amiruokchu, ram pumpui chu a thîkna mei chun kâng hmang a tih; tâwpna chu, anih, rama chêngtuhai po po tâwpna râpthlâktak el chu ân tlungtir vak ding a ni sih a."

The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.","Kereth hnam, tuisuoriet panga chêngtuhai chu an chung a va rik de!

"And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.","Chu vakam hrûl chu Juda sûng- kuo a la um sunhai ta ding kha nîng a ta, chutaka chun an ran ruol chu intlattir tâng an ta, Askelon inhaia chun zânah riek an tih; LALPA an Pathien chun anni chu hung sir a ta, an sal intângna chu a hlîppêk ta ding a ni sih a."

"Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.","Chuleiin, kei le kei insâlin, sipaihai LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun a tih: “Matheiloin Moab chu Sodom ang hung nîng a ta, Ammon thlahai chu Gomorra, chikhurhai hmun le zakthlai bil râusan kumkhuo ang chu hung nîng a tih.

"This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.","Sipaihai LALPA mihai chunga chun anni chu an insuklienin, anni chu an lo hrilsiet ta leiin hi thil hi an chapopui dingin an hmu ding a nih."
"Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.","An chunga chun LALPA chu ṭiumtak nîng a ta; hnuoi chunga pathienhai po po chu a sukbohmang ding a ni sih a; chuongchun, mihriem- hai chun ama chu be tâng an ta, mi tinin mâni hmun senga inthawk le, hnamhai po po chun mâni thlierkâr- haia inthawk chun."

"And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work.","A sûnga chun ran ruolhai riek an ta, ran chi tinrênghai chu: kai- kuongrâl le saku chu, a khawpui laia chun riek an ta, an râwlhai chu tukvera inthawka hriet nîng a ta: sidar thinga remhai khawm chu a sukruok ta sih a."
"This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.","Hi hi khawpui hlim, fîmkhur lotaka khawsa a, a lungrila, “Kei ka nih, kei naw chu tu dang khawm an um nawh,” titu chu: iengtiziea râusana umin ran ruol riekna hmun a hung ni el am a ni ta leh aw! tukhawm a fe khêl taphawt chun inhlîp an ta, an kut thinkhum an tih."
Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!,"Khawpui nêksâwra um, sukpawr- chea um le hela um chu a chung a va rik de!"
She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.,"Ama chun râwl chu a pawisa nawh a, sukdikna chu a pawm nawh a, LALPA khawm chu a ring nawh a; a Pathien khawm chu a hung hnai bawk nawh a."

"Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.","Ama sûnga chun LALPA chu mi indik a na; rîtlona chu thaw naw ni; zîng tinin a rorêlna chu varah a hung lâk suok a, a thlâwn ngai hrim hrim nawh a; amiruokchu, mi fel naw chun inzakna a hriet naw a nih."
"I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.","Hnamhai chu ka sât thlâk a, an in insânghai chen khawm chu râu- sanin a um tah a; an kawtthlêrhai chu ka suksiet vawng a, tukhawma an hraw ta nawh a; an khawpuihai chu suksietin a um a, chuongchun, mi an um ta nawh a, a hluotu khawm an um ta nawh."
"I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.","Ama chungthua ka lo ruot ta ang po poin, a chêngna chu sât thlâk a ni nawna dingin. “Matheiloin kei mi ṭîng i ta, sukdikna chu hmu bawk i tih,” ka ta; nisienlakhawm, zîngkâr an tho a, an thilthawhai po poa chun an sukdik nawh a."
"Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.","LALPA chun, “Chuleichun, kei mi nghâk unla, sase se dinga ka tho ni hmakhat chun, ka thiltum chu, ka lunginsenna ṭium tak le ka lungin- thak nasatak chu bun khum dinga ramhai ka kei khâwm theina dingin hnamhai kei khâwm chu a ni sih a; leihnuoi hluo po po chu ka îtthîkna mei chun a kâng hmang ding a ni sih a."

"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.","Ethiopia vadunghai khêla in- thawk chun ka riminhnik rawtuhai, ka hnawtdarhai naunuhmeihai ngei chun, ka thil inhlânhai chu hung chawi an ta."
"In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.","Chu nia chun i thil thawhai po po, ka chunga i bawsietnahai lei chun inzak ta naw ti nih a; nanga sûnga inthawkin nasataka nang chapopui- tuhai che chu ka lâk suok ding a ni ta sih a; chuongchun, ka tlâng inthienga chun chapo ta ngai hrim hrim naw ti nih."
"But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, i sûnga chun mi pasiehai le mî sukrimsika umhai chu mâksan ka ta, LALPA hming chu ring tâng an tih."
"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.","Israel mi hlabîkhai chun rîtlona thaw ta naw ni hai a, khêl khawm hril ta ngai naw nihai; an bauhaia chun lei mi hlêm hmangna hrim hrim khawm hmu ni ngai ta naw nih; khawp dingin fâng an ta, zâl an tih, tukhawma an sukṭi ta naw ding a ni sih a,” a ta."

"Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.","LALPA chun i chungthu rêlna chu a lâk hmang tah a, I hmêlma khawm chu a hnawt dawk tah a nih; Israel Lal, Lalpa ngei chu nangmaa chun a um a, Thil ṭha naw hril ṭi ta dêr naw ti nih."
"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.","Chu ni chun Jerusalem kuoma chun, “Ṭi ta naw rawh: Aw Zion, i kut chu inzawitir naw rawh."
"Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.","LALPA i Pathien thilthawthei- tak, sandamtu ding chu i sûnga chun a um a; Nang chu hlimnain lâwm a ti che a, a hmangainaa chun châwl a ta, Hla sakin nangmaa chun hlim a tih."
"I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; to whom the burden upon her was a reproach.","Nangma ta, sie hmanga um tahai, hrilsietna riktaka phurtuhai chu inkhâwmna ursûntaka dingin kei khâwm ka tih."
"Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.","Ngai ta, chu pha chun nangma sukrimsituhai che chu keiin sawisâng ka ta: A ngîr chu sandam ka ta, hnawt hmanga um chu kei khâwm ka tih; Hnuoi chung po poa an hmaimâwkna lo um ta chu, Hming le inpâkna siempêk ka tih."
"At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.","Chu pha chun hung la lût kati cheh a, chu pha chun la khâwm ka ti cheu; In mithmu ngeia in sal intângna ka hung lâk kîr pha chun, Leihnuoia hnam po polaia chun, inpâkna le hming ka siempêk ding cheu a ni sih a,” LALPA chun a tih."
