"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.","A tîrin thu a um, Thu chu Pathien kuomah a um, Thu chu Pathien a nih."
The same was in the beginning with God.,Chu chu a tîrin Pathien kuomah a um.
All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.,Iengkim a rêngin ama siem a nih; thil siem po po hi ama siem naw iengkhawm a um nawh.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.,Amaa chun hringna a um; chu hringna chu mihriemhai var a nih.
And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.,"Var chu inthim lai a hung var a, inthimin chu chu a hriet nawh."
"There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.","Pathien tir mi pakhat a lo um a, a hming chu Johan a nih."
"The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.","Ama chu inhriettir dingin a hung a, var thu chu inhriettir dingin; ama leia mi po poin an awina dingin."
"He was not the light, but came that he might bear witness of the light.","Ama chu var chu a ni nawh, var thu chu inhriettir dinga hung a ni lem."
"There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world.","Var indik tak mi tin sukvar hlak kha a um a, khawvêlah a hung zing a nih."
"He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.","Ama chu khawvêlah a um a, khawvêl ama siem a na, khawvêlin ama a hriet si nawh."
"He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.","Ama mihai kuomah a hung a, ama mihaiin an lo lâwm si nawh."
"But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name:","Nisienlakhawm, ama lâwm taphawt chu, an kuomah Pathien nauhai ni theina ding a pêk, a hming ringtuhai chu."
"who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.","Chuong mihai chu thisena nei an ni nawh a, tisa dit zâwnga nei an ni bawk nawh a, pasal dit zâwnga nei khawm an ni nawh a, Pathien inei an ni lem."
"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.","Chun, Thu chu tisain a hung inchang a, eini lai a hung um tah a, (Pa nau khât nei ropui angin a ropuizie ei hmuh), lunginsietna le thutakin a sip."
"John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.","Johan chun a thu ân hriettir a, a khêk a, “ ‘Ka hnunga hung ding chu ka nêka ropui lem a nih, ka um hmaa um ta hrim a ni leiin,’ tia a thu ka hril kha ama hi a nih,” a ta."
"For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.","A famkimna ei chang seng, lunginsietna chunga lunginsiet nâwksâwnna leh."
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.,"Dân chu Mosie hmanga pêk a na, lunginsietna le thutak chu Isu Krista leiin a hung um."
"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.","Tukhawmin ienglai khawmin Pathien an hmu nawh; a Naupa khât nei sun, Pa ângsûnga um ngei khan a chanchin a hril tah a nih."
"And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?","Chun, Judahaiin, “Tû am i na?” tia indawn dingin Jerusalema inthawkin a kuomah thiempuhai le Levi chia mihai an tir lai khan, hieng hi Johan thu lo inhriettir chu a nih:"
"And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.",“Kei chu Krista chu ka ni nawh” tiin inphat loin ân phuong a.
"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Tû am i ni leh? Elija i ni?” an ta, an indawn a. Ama chun, “Ka ni nawh,” a ta. “Zâwlnei kha i ni?” an ta, ama chun, “Ni lo e,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Anleh, tû am i na? a mi tirtuhai kan dawn theina dingin mi hril ta la. I chanchin hrim ieng am i hril ding a na?” an ta."
"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.","Ama chun, “ ‘Lalpa lampui suk- ruol ro,’ tia thlalêra khêktu râwl chu ka nih; zâwlnei Isai hril ang khan,” a ta."
And they had been sent from the Pharisees.,Mi tirhai chu Pharisaihai kuoma mi an nih.
"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?","Anni chun a kuomah, “Krista bêk, Elija bêk, zâwlnei amani bêk i ni si naw chun, iengdinga i baptis hlak am a na?” an ta, an indawn a."
"John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,","Chun, Johan chun an kuomah, “Keiin tuiin ka baptis hlak, nangni lai in hriet naw mi pakhat a ngîr a nih,"
"even he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.","ama chu ka hnunga hung ding chu a na, a kekawk hrui sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
"These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",Chuong thil chu Jordan râla Bethania Johanin a baptisnaa kha thaw an nih.
"On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!","Chun, a zînga chun Johanin Isu a kuoma hung ding a hmuh a. Chun, a hril a, “En ta u, Pathien Berâmte khawvêl suol fepuitu ding saw!"
"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.","Saw saw a nih, ‘mi pakhat ka nêka ropui lem, ka hnunga hung ding a um, ama chu ka um hmaa um ta hrim a nih,’ ka ti kha."
"And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.","Ama chu ka lo hriet si nawh; nisienlakhawm, Israelhai kuoma a hung inlangna dingin, tuia baptis-in ka hung a nih,” a ta."
"And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.","Chun, Johanin a thu ân hriettir a, a hril a, “Thlarau chu vaṭhu angin vâna inthawka ṭum ka hmuh a, a chungah a fu zing a."
"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.","Ama chu ka hriet si nawh a, nisienlakhawm, tuia baptis dinga a mi tirtu khan ka kuomah, ‘Tû chunga khawm Thlarau zu fua, a chunga um zing i hmu chun, ama chu Thlarau Inthienga baptistu ding chu nîng a tih,’ a tih a."
"And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.","Chu chu ka hmu tah a, ama hi Pathien Naupa a nih ti kân hriettir tah,” a ta."
"Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;","Chun, a zîng nâwk chun Johan a ngîr a, a închûktirhai pahni leh;"
"and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!","chun, Isu invâk vêl lai chu an en a, “En ta u, Pathien Berâmte saw,” a ta."
"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.","Chun, a închûktirhai pahni chun a thu hril chu an hriet a, Isu an zui tah a."
"And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou?","Chun, Isu a nghah a, an hung zui chu a hmuh a, an kuomah, “Ieng am in zawng a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Rabbi, (chu chu inchûktirtu tina a nih), khâwlai am i um a?” an ta."
"He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hung unla, hmûng in tih,” a ta. Chuong- chun, an feh a, a umna chu an hmuh a, chu ni chun a kuomah an um zing a; zânbu suong pha vêl a nih."
"One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.","Johan thu hril hrea Isu zuihai pahni chu, a pakhat lem chu Andri, Simon Peter unau a nih."
"He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).","Ama chun a hmasatakin ama unau Simon a hmuh a, a kuomah “Messie kan hmu tah,” a ta, (chu chu Krista tina a nih.)"
"He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).","Chuongchun, Isu kuomah a hung ṭhuoi a, Isûn ama chu a lo en a, “Johan naupa Simon i nih, Kipha tîng an ti che,” a ta, (chu chu Peter tina a nih.)"
"On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.","Chun, a zînga chun Isu Galili ramah fe a tum a, Philip a hmuh a, “Mi zui rawh,” a ta."
"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.","Philip chu Bethsaida khuoa mi a nih, chu chu Andri le Peter umna khuo bawk a nih."
"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.","Philip chun Nathanael a hmuh a, a kuomah, “A chanchin Mosiein Dân lekhabua a ziek le, zâwlneihaiin an ziek kha, ama chu kan hmu tah, Nazareth Isu, Josef naupa chu,” a ta."
"And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.","Chun, Nathanael chun a kuomah, “Nazareth khuoah thil ṭha a suok thei am a nih?” a ta. Philip chun a kuomah, “Hung la, en rawh,” a ta."
"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!","Isûn Nathanael a kuoma hung ding chu a hmuh a, a chanchin a lo hril a, “En ta u, Israel mi tak, rîtlona hrim hrim nei lo saw,” a ta."
"Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.","Nathanael chun a kuomah, “Nangin iengtin am i mi hriet a?” a ta. Isûn a kuomah, “Philipin a ko hma cheh a, theichang bula i um lai khan ka hmu che annâwm,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.","Nathanaelin a kuomah, “Rabbi, Pathien Naupa i nih, Israelhai Laltak i nih,” tiin a dawn a."
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.","Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Theichang bulah ka hmu che,’ i kuoma ka ti leiin i ring a ni maw? Hieng nêka thil ropui lem la hmûng i tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.","Chun, Isu bawkin a kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, vân inhawngah, Pathien vântir- kohai Mihriem Naupa chunga hin a lâwn le a ṭum la hmûng in tih,” a ta."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.","“Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm berâm huona kawtkhâra lût loa, a dang tienga lâwn lût chu ama chu iengkhat inruhmang le suomhmang a nih."
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.,"Tûkhawm kawtkhâra lût ruok chu, berâm vêngtu a nih."
"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.","Kawtkhâr vêngtuin ama chu a lo hawng pêk hlak a; berâmhaiin a râwl an hriet hlak a; ama berâmhai chu an hmingin a ko seng a, a ṭhuoi suok hlak a."
"When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.","A ta po po ân suoktir phingleh, an hma a ṭhuoi a, berâmhaiin ama an zu i hlak a, a râwl an hriet sih a."
"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.","Mi dang chu zui naw ni hai a, tlân hmang san lem an tih; mi danghai râwl chu an hriet naw leiin,” a ta."
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.,"Chu tekhithu chu Isûn an kuomah a hril a; nisienlakhawm, ieng thu am a na an kuomah a hril an hriet si nawh a."
"Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.","Chuongchun, Isûn an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, kei hi berâm kawtkhâr chu ka nih,"
All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.,"ka hmaa hunghai po po kha inruhmanghai, suomhmanghai an ni vawng a; nisienlakhawm, berâmhai chun an thu an awi nawh."
"I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.","Kei kawtkhâr chu ka nih; tûkhawm keimaah a lût chun, humhimin um a ta, lûtin suok a ta, fâk ding hmu bawk a tih."
"The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.","Inruhmang chu, inru ding le, sukhlum ding le sukse ding naw chun a hung nawh; kei chu hringna an neina dingin, tamtaka an neina dinga hung ka nih."
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.,Kei bêram vêngtu ṭha chu ka nih; berâm vêngtu ṭha chun berâmhai ta dingin a hringna a pêk hlak.
"He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them:","Inhlawfa, berâm vêngtu tak ni loa, berâmhai a ta ni lo chun satene hung a hmu chun berâmhai a tlânsan hlak; chun, satene chun berâmhai a seh a, a sukdar hlak;"
"he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.","inhlawfa a na, berâmhai a ngai- sak naw leiin a tlânsan hlak a nih."
"I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,","Kei chu berâm vêngtu ṭha ka nih; ka ta chu ka hriet a, ka ta khawmin an mi hriet a nih,"
"even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.","Pain a mi hriet a, kei khawmin Pa ka hriet ang hin; chun, berâmhai ta ding chun ka hringna ka pêk."
"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.","Chun, hi berâm huona mi naw khawm hi, berâm dang ka nei; anni khawm ka la hung ṭhuoi ding a nih, ka râwl khawm hrieng an tih, chuongchun, pâwl khatin um an ta, a vêngtu pakhat leh."
"Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.","“Hi lei hin Pain a mi hmangai a nih, lâk nâwk dinga ka hringna ka pêk ding leiin."
"No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.","Tûkhawmin mi lâkpêk naw ni hai, keima thu thuin ka pêk lem ding a nih; pe thei ka nih, la nâwk thei khawm ka nih. Hi thupêk hi ka Pa kuoma inthawka ka hmu a nih,” a ta."
There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.,"Chuong thu lei chun Judahai an inṭheh a, an inkhing nâwk a."
"And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?","A ṭhen tamtakin, “Khawhri a zâwl a, ân vêt a ni hi; iengdinga a thu in ngai am a na?” an ta."
"Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?","A ṭhenin, “Hieng thu hi khawhri zâwl thuhril a ni nawh ie. Khawhri chun mitdel mit a sukvar thei am a nih?” an ta."
And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:,"Chun, Jerusalema Inpumpêk Ruoiṭhe lai a na; chu chu thlasik lai a nih."
it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.,"Chun, Isu Pathien biekinah, Solomon tuolpûka chun ân lawn ân lawn a."
"The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.","Chun, Judahai a kâwlah an hung a, a kuomah, “Ieng chen am lungâwpinkaiin i mi sie ding a na? Krista i ni chun feltakin mi hril rawh,” an ta."
"Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.","Isûn an kuomah, “Ka hril ta cheu kha in awi si nawh; ka Pa hminga thil ka thaw hi, hieng hin ka chanchin ân hriettir a ni hi."
"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.","Nisienlakhawm, in awi si nawh, ka berâm laia mi in ni naw leiin."
"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:","Ka berâmhaiin ka râwl an hriet hlak, kei khawmin anni chu ka hriet, anni chun an mi zui hlak."
"and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.","An kuomah chatuona hringna ka pêk hlak; kumkhuoin bohmang naw ni hai a, tukhawmin ka kuta inthawkin mi lâkpêk bawk naw ni hai."
"My Father, who hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.","Anni mi petu ka Pa chu mi po po nêka ropui a nih, tukhawmin Pa kuta inthawk chu lâkpêk thei naw ni hai."
I and the Father are one.,"Kei le Pa chu pumkhat kan nih,” tiin a dawn a."
The Jews took up stones again to stone him.,"Chun, Judahai chun a dêngna dingin lung an rût nâwk a."
"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?","Chun, Isûn anni chu a biek a, “Pa kuoma inthawka suok sinthaw ṭha tamtak kân entir cheu a, khâng sinthawhai laia ieng sinthaw lei khan am a ni lunga in mi dêng ding hi?” a ta."
"The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.","Judahai chun a kuomah, “Sin ṭha chunga lunga dêng ding che kan ni nawh a; Pathien i hrilsietna chunga le, nang mihriem ni sih a, Pathiena în siem lei hin a ni lem a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?","Isûn an kuomah, “In Dân lekhabuah, ‘Pathienhai in nih ka tih,’ ti ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),","Pathien thu tlungnahai hman pathienhai an ti chun, (Pathien Lekha thu bân thei a ni si nawh a)"
"say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?","Pain a iruot, khawvêla a itir chunga hin, ‘Pathien Naupa ka nih,’ ka ti leiin, ‘Pathien i hrilsiet,’ in ti a ni maw?"
"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",Ka pa sinthaw ka ni naw chun mi ring naw ro.
"But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.","Amiruokchu, thaw ka ni chun, kei mi ring naw unla khawm, sin- thawhai bêk hi ring ro; Pa keimaah a um ti le, kei Paah ka um ti in hriet a, in ringna dingin,” a ta, a dawn a."
They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.,"Chuongchun, ama chu man an tum nâwk a, nisienlakhawm, an kuta inthawkin a suok a."
And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.,"Jordan vadung râlah, Johanin a tîra mi a baptisna hmun tieng khan a fe hmang nâwk tah a, chutaka chun a um ta zing a."
"And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.","Chun, mi tamtak a kuomah an hung a, “Johanin thilmak iengkhawm chu a thaw nawh a; nisienlakhawm, Johanin hi mipa chungchâng thu a hril taphawt kha chu ân dik hle hi,” an ta."
And many believed on him there.,"Chun, chutaka chun mi tam- takin ama an ring tah a."
"Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.","Chun, mi pakhat, Mari le a zuorpuinu Martha umna khuo Bethania mi, Lazar damnaw a um a."
"And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.","(Mari, hriek rim inhnik Lal chu nâla, a sama a ke hrutu kha, kha minu ṭapa Lazar a nih dam naw chu.)"
"The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.","Chun, a farnuhaiin Isu kuomah, “Lalpa, ngai ta, i hmangai kha a damnaw ie,” tiin mi an tir a."
"But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.","Isûn chu chu a hriet a, “Hi natna hi thina ding a ni nawh, Pathien ropuina ding a ni lem, Pathien Naupa chu hi lei hin a la mawina dingin,” a ta."
"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.","Chun, Isûn Martha hai, a zuor- puinu hai, Lazar hai a hmangai a."
"When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.","Chuleiin, a damnaw ti a hrietin a umna ngaiah ni hni a la um ta rawp a."
"Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judæa again.","Chun, chu hnunga chun a închûktirhai kuomah, “Judai ramah fe nâwk ei tiu,” a ta."
"The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?","Chun, inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Rabbi, kha hma el khan Judahaiin lunga dêng an tum che kha; chuong sa sa chun chutaka chun i la fe rawp ding am a nih?” an ta."
"Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.","Isûn, “Sûnah dârkâr sâwm le pahni a um naw am a nih? Mi sûnah a lêng chun a pêm ngai nawh, hi khawvêl var hi a hmu leiin."
"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.","Amiruokchu, mi zânah a lêng chun a pêm hlak, amaa chun var a um naw leiin,” a ta, a dawn a."
"These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.","Chuong thu chu a hril a; chun, chu hnunga chun an kuomah, “Ei ruolpa Lazar chu a ininnghil tah a; a ininnghil keihar dingin ka fe ding a nih,” a ta."
"The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.","Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Lalpa a ininnghil a ni chun dam nâwk el a tih,” an ta."
Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.,"(Isûn a thi thu a hril a nih; nisienlakhawm, anni chun a châwl sûnga a ininnghil thu a hril amanih an ta.)"
"Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.","Chuongchun, Isûn fietakin an kuomah a hril a, “Lazar a thi a nih."
"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.","Chutaka ka um naw chu ka lâwm pêk cheu, in ring theina dingin; nisienlakhawm, a kuomah fêng ei tiu,” a ta."
"Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.","Chun, Thoma (Didum an ti bawk) chun, ân chûktir chanpuihai kuomah, “A thinaa thi ve dingin fe vêng ei tiu,” a ta."
"So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.","Chuongchun, Isûn a tlung chun, ni li thlânah a lo um tah ti a hriet a,"
"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;","Bethani chu Jerusalem kâwl a na, fing sâwmpanga laia hla a nih;"
"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.","chuongchun, an ṭapa thi chunga sukthlamuong dingin Judahai rawi tamtak Martha le Mari kuomah an hung a."
"Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.",Martha chun Isu a hung ding a nih ti a hriet phingleh a va tuok a; Mari ruok chu inah a la ṭhung zing a.
"Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.","Chun, Martha chun Isu kuomah, “Lalpa hitaka um ni la chu, ka ṭapa a thi naw ding bah."
"And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.","Tukhawm hin Pathien kuoma i ngên taphawt chu Pathienin pêng a ti che ti ka hriet,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.","Isûn a kuomah, “I ṭapa tho nâwk a tih,” a ta."
"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.","Martha chun a kuomah, “Ni kin nia, thonâwknaa chun thonâwk a tih ti ka hriet,” a ta."
"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Kei hi thonâwkna le hringna chu ka nih; tûkhawm a mi ring chu thi sienla khawm hring zing a tih;"

"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Ring e Lalpa, Krista, Pathien Naupa, khawvêla hung ding chu i ni ti ka ring ie,” a ta."
"And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.","Chun, chu thu chu a hril zo phingleh a feh a, a zuorpuinu Mari chu inrûkin a va ko a, “Inchûktirtu hitakah a um a, a ko che,” a ta."
"And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.","Ama chun chu chu a hriet phingleh a tho vak a, a kuomah a va feh a."
"(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)","(Isu chu khuo a la lût nawh a, Marthain a va tuok laia, a umna ngaiah a la um a.)"
"The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.","In sûnga a thlamuongtu a umpui Judahai chun, Mari a tho vaka, a suok an hmu phingleh, thlâna ṭap dingin a fe amanih an ta, an zui a."
"Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.","Chun, Mari chun Isu umna chu a va tlung a, a hmu phingleh a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, hitaka um ni la chu ka ṭapa a thi naw ding bah,” a ta."
"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,","Isu chun Mari ṭap le a hung zuitu Judahai ṭap chu a hmuin, a lungrilin ân rûm a, a lungngai a."
"and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.","“Ama chu khâwlai am in inzâl a?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, hung la, en ta,” an ta."
Jesus wept.,Isu a ṭap tah a.
"The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!","Chun, Judahai chun, “En ta u, Lazar hi a lo va hmangai deh e!” an ta."
"But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?","Nisienlakhawm, ṭhenkhat chun, “Hi mitdel mit sukvartu hin, hi mipa khawm hi ân thi naw tir thei naw am a nih?” an ta."
"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.","Chun, Isu chu a lungrilin ân rûm nâwk a, thlân chu a tlung tah a. Chu thlân chu pûk a na, a kawtkhâra chun lung pakhat a um a."
"Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days.","Isûn, “Lung hi dawm tâwl ro,” a ta. A thipa farnu Martha chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, tuhin chu thu tâng a tih, a thina ni li a ni ta sih a,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?","Isûn a kuomah, “I ring chun Pathien ropuizie hmûng i tih, ka ti naw che am a nih?” a ta."
"So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.","Chuongchun, lung chu an dawm tâwl a. Chun, Isu a dâk a, “Pa, ka thu i ngai leiin i chungah ka lâwm ie."
"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.","Kumkhuoin ka thu i ngai hlak ti ka hriet zing a nih; nisienlakhawm, mipui ngîr khup lei hin chu chu ka ti a nih, nangin i mi tir ti an ring theina dingin,” a ta."
"And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.","Chun, chuonga a ṭawng zo phingleh râwl inringtakin, “Lazar, hung suok rawh,” a ta, a khêk a."
"He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.","Mithi chu a kut a ke thlân puona tuom pumin a hung suok tah a, a hmai chu inhrûkna puona tuom a nih. Isûn an kuomah, “Sût unla, infetir ro,” a ta."
"Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.","Chuleichun, Mari lêngpuitu Isu thilthaw hmu Juda mi tamtakin Isu an ring tah a."
"But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen Phari- saihai kuomah an va feh a, an kuomah Isu thilthawhai chu an hril a."
"The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.","Chuongchun, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chun rorêltuhai an ko khâwm a, “Iengtin am thâwng ei ta? Hi mipa hin thilmak tamtak a thaw sih a."
"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.","Hieng anga ei thlathlam el chun mi po poin ama ring an ta; chun, Roma mihai hung an ta, ei hmun le ei chihai hi mi lâkpêk an tih,” an ta."
"But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat, Kaiapha, chu kuma Thiempu Laltak chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn ieng- khawm in hriet dêr nawh."
"nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.","Ei chi po po bohmang nawna dingin, mi po po nêka mi pakhat thi in ta dingin a ṭha ti in ngaituo bawk nawh,” a ta."
"Now this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;","(Chu thu chu ama phuok- fâwmin a hril nawh, chu kum chun Thiempu Laltak a na, an chihai nêka Isu a thi ding thu a hril lâwk a ni lem."
"and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.","Chuhai chihai ai chau chun a ni nawh, Pathien nau khawvêla indarhai po po pâwl khata a ṭhuoi khâwmna dingin a ni bawk.)"
So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.,"Chuongchun, chu ni chena inthawk chu ama sukhlum dingin an inrâwn rawp a."
"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.","Chuleiin, Isu chu Judahai lai ân langin a lêng nâwk ta nawh a, chutaka inthawkin thlalêr dep tienga khaw pakhat Ephraim an tia chun a va fe ta lem a; chutaka chun inchûktirhai leh an um ta zing a."
"Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.","Chun, Judahai Fekân Ruoiṭhe chu a hnai tah a, mi tamtak inthien dingin rama inthawk, Fekân Ruoiṭhe hma chun, Jerusalemah an hang feh a."
"They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?","Chuongchun, Isu an zawng a, Pathien biekinah ngir pumin an inbiek a, “Ieng am in ring a? Ruoi- ṭhenaah hung naw ni maw?” an in tih a."
"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.",Thiempu Lalhai le Pharisai- haiin ama chu an man theina dingin tûkhawmin a umna an hriet chun phuong ding a nih ti thu an pêk ta sih a.
"Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.","Chun, Fekân Ruoiṭhena ding ni ruk a la umin, Isu mithi laia inthawka a keitho Lazar umna Bethani kha a hung tlung a."
So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.,"Chun, chutaka chun ama ta dingin zânah ruoi an ṭheh a; Martha chun rawng a bâwl a, Lazar chu a thlaithlêng awtpuitu pakhat a nih."
"Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.","Chun, Mariin bûk zâtve Spiknard hriek rim inhnik totak a hung chawi a, Isu kehai a nâl a, a samin a kehai chu a hrûk a; chuongchun, chu hriek rim chun in chu a sip rum rum el a."
"But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,","Nisienlakhawm, Iskariot Juda, a închûktir pakhat, ân mantirtu ding chun,"
"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?",“Hi hriek rim inhnik hi iengdinga duli za thuma zawra pasiehai kuoma an pêk lem naw am a na?” a ta.
"Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.","(Pasiehai a ngaisak leia chu thu chu hril a ni nawh; inru a na, tangka ip a kawl a, a sûnga um chu a lâk hlak lei a ni lem a)."
"Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.","Chun, Isûn, “Tosan rawh, an mi phûm nia dingin khêk raw se."
For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.,"Pasiehai chu kumkhuoin in kuoma um an nih, kei ruok chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um ding ka ni nawh,” a ta."
"The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.","Chun, Isu chutaka chun a um ti Juda mi narânhai chun an lo hriet tah a; chun, an hung a, Isu chau chu an hungna san a ni nawh a, mithi laia inthawka a keitho Lazar khawm kha hmu dingin a ni bawk a."
But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;,"Chun, thiempu lalhai chu Lazar khawm sukhlum dingin an inrâwn a;"
"because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.","ama leia Juda tamtakin an pakai san a, Isu an ring hlak leiin."
"On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,","A zînga chun, ruoiṭhenaa hung mipui tamtakin Isu Jerusalemah a hung ding a nih ti an hrietin,"
"took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.","tûm kauhai an chawi a, a tuok dingin an va suok a, “Hosanna, Lalpa hminga Israel Lal hung chu inpâkin um raw se,” tiin an khêk a."
"And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,","Chun, Isûn sabengtungtê a hmuh a, a chungah a chuong a,"
"Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.","“Ṭi naw, Zion naunu, En ta, i Lal chu, Sabengtungtê chunga chuongin, A hung ding a nih,” ti ziek ang khan."
"These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.","Chuong thu chu a tîrin a închûktirhaiin an hriet nawh; nisien- lakhawm, Isu chawimawia a um hnung chun, a chanchinah chuong thu chu ziek a nih ti le, a chungah chuong thil chu an lo thaw ngei ti an hriet tah a."
"The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.","Chun, Lazar thlâna inthawka a ko suok a, mithi laia inthawka a keitho laia mipui umhai khan, a thu chu an inhriettir ta pei a."
"For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.",Chu lei chun a nih mipuihai khawmin ama chu an tuok chu; chu thilmak chu a thaw ti an hriet sih a.
"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing; lo, the world is gone after him.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihai chun, “Hre ro, iengkhawm in law thei naw hi; en ta u, khawvêlin ama an zui ta hi,” an ta."
Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:,"Chun, ruoiṭhenaa Pathien chibai bûk dinga hang fehai lai Grik tuhai amanih an um a."
"these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.","Chuonghai chu Galili rama Bethsaida khuoa mi Philip kuoma chun an hung a, a kuomah, “Pu, Isu hmu kan nuom,” an ta, an ngên a."
"Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.",Philip chun Andri a hung hril a; Andri le Philip chun Isu an hung hril a.
"And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, an kuomah, “Mihriem Naupa chawi- mawia a um hun chu a tlung tah."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, bu mal hnuoiah a tlah a, a thi naw chun, a mal chauin a um zing hlak; a thi ruok chun tamtakin a ra hlak."

"Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.","Pa, i hming inchawimawi rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, vâna inthawkin râwl a hung suok a, “Ka chawimawi tah, chawimawi nâwk bawk ka tih,” a ta."
"The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.","Chun, mipui a kâwla ngîrhai chun chu chu an hriet a, “Vân ân rûm a nih,” an ta, mi danghaiin, “Vantirkoin ama a biek a nih,” an ta."
"Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.","Isûn a dawn a, “Chu râwl chu ka ta dinga hung suok a ni nawh, nangni ta dingin a ni lem."

"But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.",Chu thu chu a thizie ding inhriettirna dingin a hril a nih.
"The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?","Chun, mipui chun a kuomah, “Krista chu chatuonin a um zing ding a nih ti Dân Lekhabuah kan hriet ie, nangin, ‘Mihriem Naupa khaikângin a um ding a nih,’ ieng ti tia ti am i na?

"Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Var hi nangni lai sâwt nawte a la um hri hi, var in nei sûng hin lêng ro, inthimin a nang nawna ding cheuin; tûkhawm inthima lêng chun a fena chin a hriet ngai nawh."
"While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.","Var in nei sûng hin var hi ring ro, var nauhai in hung ni theina dingin,” a ta.

"For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,","Hi lei hin a nih an ring thei naw, Isaiin,"

"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.","Chun, Fekân Ruoiṭhe hmain Isûn hi khawvêl hi suok sana, Pa kuoma a fe hun a tlung tah ti a hriet a.

"Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.","Chun, châwtawlah tui a sung a, inchûktirhai ke a sâwp a, inhrûkna puon a dierkei chun a hrûk pei a."
"So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?","Chuongchun, Simon Peter kuomah a hung a. Ama chun, “Lalpa, nang êmin ka ke i sâwp ding am a nih?” a ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.","Isûn a kuomah, “Ka thilthaw hi tuhin i hriet nawh; nisienlakhawm, nakie tieng la hrieng i tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.","Peterin a kuomah, “Ka ke sâwp naw tawp i tih!” a ta; Isûn a kuomah, “Ka sâwp naw che chun ka kuomah iengkhawm chan nei naw ti nih,” a ta."
"Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.","Simon Peter chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, chuong a ni chun, ka ke chau ni loin, ka kut le ka lu khawm tie,” a ta."
"Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.","Isûn a kuomah, “Insil ta chu a ke naw chu sâwp a ngai nawh, a fai deh annâwm; nangni in fai, in rêng ruok chun ni loin,” a ta."
"For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.","(Ân mantirtu ding chu a hriet sih a; chuleiin, “In rêngin in fai nawh,” a ti a nih.)"
"So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?","Chuongchun, an ke a sâwp a, a puonhai a lâk a, a ṭhung nâwk chun an kuomah, “In chunga ka thilthaw hi ieng thawna am a na, in hriet am?"

"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.","In rênga thu ka hril nawh; ka ithlang hai chu ka hriet, nisienlakhawm, chu chu, ‘Ka bei fatu chun, A kekhawng chu ka chungah ân let tah,’ ti Pathien Lekha Thu kha a hung tlung theina dingin a nih."

"The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.","Chun, inchûktirhai chun a ti bîk an hriet nawh a, an inen tâwl a."
"There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.","Chun, a închûktirhai laia mi pakhat, Isûn a ihmangai chu, dawkân sîrah Isu ângsûnga bawkin a um a."
"Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell us who it is of whom he speaketh.","Chun, Simon Peterin ama kuoma chun, “Tu thu tak am a na a hril, indawn ta,” tiin zaizirin a biek a."
"He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?","Ama chu a umna ngaiah a um a, Isu âwm hnengin a hung thleh a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, tu tak am a na?” a ta."
"Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.","Chun, Isûn “Bei hlek inchiepêk ka ta, ka ipêk chu nîng a tih,” a ta, a dawn a.

"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.","Ngai ro, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, anih, a tlung zing tah, chu pha chun, mâni in sengah indar vawng in tih, keia khât chauin mi thlâthlam in tih; nisienlakhawm, Pa ka kuoma a um leiin makhât chauin ka um si nawh."
"These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.","Hieng thu hi in kuomah ka hril ta hi, keimaa in thlamuongna dingin. Khawvêla hin rinumin in um hlak; nisienlakhawm, thlamuong- takin um ro, keiin khawvêl ka hne tah,” a ta."
"These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee:","Chuong thu chu Isûn a hril a; chun vântieng nghain, “Pa, a hun a tlung tah; i Naupa chawimawi rawh, Naupa hin a chawimawina ding chein;"
"even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.","khânga mi po po chunga thuneia i siem khan, a kuoma i pêkhai po chu chatuona hringna a pêk theina dingin."
"And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ.",Hi hi chatuona hringna a nih: nang Pathien tak chau le i tir Isu Krista hriet hi.
"I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.","Nangin thil thaw ding i mi pêk kha ka thaw zo tah a, khawvêla hin ka chawimawi ta che."
"And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.","Aw Pa, khawvêl um hmaa i kuoma mawina ka inei khan, tuhin nangma kuoma ngei mi chawimawi rawh."
"I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.","“Nangin khawvêla inthawka mî i mi pêkhai kuoma khan i hming ka suklang tah. Anni chu i ta an ni tah, nangin anni chu kei i mi pêk tah a, anni chun i thu an zâwm tah:"
Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:,"Nangin thil i mi pêk po po, i kuoma inthawka suok an nih ti tuhin an hriet tah."
"for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.","Nangin thu i mi pêkhai kha an kuoma ka pêk ta sih a; chuong chu an vawn a, i kuoma inthawka suok ka nih ti indiktakin an hriet tah, nangin i mi tir ti khawm an awi tah."
"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:","“An ta dinga ka ngênpêk hi, khawvêl ta dinga ngênpêk ka ni nawh; nangin i mi pêkhai ta ding lemin a nih; i ta an ni si."
"and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.","Thil po po ka ta taphawt chu i ta a nih, i ta chu ka ta a nih; anni leiin chawimawiin ka um hlak."
"And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are.","Chun, kei chu khawvêlah um ta naw ning, hienghai hi chu khaw- vêlah um an tih, kei chu i kuomah ka hung ding a ni tah. Pa Inthieng, anni chu I hmingin hum rawh, I hming mi pêk khan, eini ang bawka pumkhat an ni theina dingin."
"While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.","“An kuomah ka um sûng khan, anni chu i hmingin ka hum hlak, i hming mi pêk khan, anni chu ka vêng a, anni lai pakhat khawm an bohmang nawh, bohmang naupa naw kha chu; Lekha thu kha a hung tlungna dingin."
"But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin i kuom- ah ka hung ding a ni tah; khawvêlah hieng thu hi ka hril a nih, ka lâwm annia an nei kimna dingin."
"I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.","I thu an kuomah ka pêk tah; chun, khawvêlin anni chu an theidah a, khawvêla mi an ni naw leiin, kei khawvêla mi ka ni naw ang bawkin."
"I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one.","“Nangin anni chu khawvêla inthawka i lâk suok dinga ngên ka ni nawh a, mi suola inthawk chun i hum ding a nih ka ti lem a nih."
"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.","Anni chu khawvêla mi an ni nawh, kei khawvêla mi ka ni naw ang bawk hin."
Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.,"Anni chu thutakin sukthieng rawh, i thu chu thutak a nih."
"As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.","Nangin khawvêla kei i mi tir ang khan, kei khawmin anni chu khawvêlah ka tir hi."
"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.","Anni leiin kân sukthieng a nih, anni khawm thutaka an inthieng theina dingin."
"Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;","“Hienghai ta ding chau hin ngên pêk ka ni nawh, an thu leia kei mi la hung ring dinghai ta ding khawma ngênpêk ka ni bawk ie, an rênga pumkhat an nina dingin;"
"that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.","Pa, nang keimaa i um le, kei nangmaa ka um ang bawk hin, anni khawm einia an umna dingin: nangin i mi tir ti khawvêlin an awi theina dingin."
"And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we are one;","Chun, nangin ropuina i mi pêk kha keiin an kuomah ka pêk tah; anni chu pumkhat an nina dingin, eini pumkhat ei ni ang bawk hin;"
"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.","kei anniah, nang keimaah, anni pumkhata an um a, an famkim theina dingin, nangin kei i mi tir ti le, i mi hmangai angin anni hi i hmangai ti, khawvêlin an hriet theina dingin."
"Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.","Pa, nangin kei i mi pêkhai hi ka umnaah ka kuoma um dingin ka dit; nangin i mi pêk ka ropuina kha an hmuna dingin; leihnuoi insieng hma khawmin nangin i mi hmangai ta sih a."
"O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;","Aw Pa feltak, khawvêl chun an hriet naw cheh a, kei ruok chun ka hriet che kha, hienghai khawm hin nangin kei i mi tir ti an hriet kha."
"and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.","Chun, an kuomah i hming kân hriettir a, inhriettir nâwk rawp ka tih; nangin kei i mi hmangaina kha anniah a um a, kei khawm annia ka um theina dingin,” a ta."
"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.","Isûn chuong thu chu a hril zoin, a închûktirhai leh an suok a, Kidron vadung an kai a. Chu- taka chun huon a um a, chutaka chun an lût a, ama le a închûktirhai leh."
"Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.","Chun, ân mantirtu ding Juda khawm chun chu hmun chu a hriet; Isu a închûktirhai leh chutaka chun a lêng rawp leiin."
"Judas then, having received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.","Chuongchun, Juda chun sipai pâwl leh, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai kuoma um manmihai leh a ṭhuoi a, khâwnvarhai, meiserhai, hriemhai chawiin chutaka chun an hung a."
"Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?","Isûn a chunga thil tlung ding po po chu a hriet zing a, a va suok a, an kuomah, “Tu am in zawng a?” a ta."
"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Nazareth Isu,” an ta, an dawn a. Isûn an kuom- ah, “Kei hi ka nih,” a ta. Chun, ân mantirtu Juda khawm chu anni lai a ngîr a."
"When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.","Isûn, “Kei hi ka nih,” a ti phing- leh, hnungtieng an intâwl a, hnuoiah an tlu tâwl a."
"Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.","Isu chun an kuomah, “Tu am in zawng a?” a ti nâwk a. Anni chun, “Nazareth Isu,” an ta."
"Jesus answered, I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:","Chun, Isûn, “Kei hi ka nih ti ka hril cheu annâwm, nangnîn kei in mi zawng chun, hienghai hi inthla ṭha ro,” a ta, a dawn a."
"that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.","(A thu hril, “Nangin kei i mi pêkhai pakhat khawm kân hmang nawh,” a ti kha a tlungna dingin.)"
"Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.","Chun, Simon Peterin kâwl- hnâm a kawl a, a phawi a, Thiempu Laltak suok a sât a, a nakâwr changtieng a sât thlâkpêk a. Suokpa hming chu Malka a nih."
"Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?","Chuongchun, Isûn Peter kuom- ah, “Kâwlhnâm kha a bâwmah thun rawh; Pain no, kei a mi pêk hi ka dâwn naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
"So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,","Chuongchun, sipai pâwl leh, an hotu laltak leh, Judahai manmihai le chun Isu an man a, an khuop a,"
"and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.","Ana kuomah an ṭhuoi hmasah a, Kaiapha tarpupa a ni leiin, Kaiapha chu, chu kum chun Thiempu Laltak a nih."
"Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.","Kaiapha chu, “Mi po po aia mi pakhat thi a ṭha,” tia Judahai rawtpuitu kha a nih."
"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;","Chun, Simon Peterin Isu a zui a, a închûktir dang pakhat leh. Chu inchûktir chu Thiempu Laltak hmêlhriet a na, Thiempu Laltak in inhuon sûng tuolah Isu kuomah a lût veh a,"
"but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.","nisienlakhawm, Peter chu tuol- ah kawtkhâr bulah a ngir zing a. Chuongchun, inchûktir dang, Thiem- pu Laltak hmêlhriet chu, a va suok a, kawtkhâr vêngtu a biek a, Peter a ṭhuoi lût a."
"The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.","Chun, kawtkhâr vêngtu nu- nghâk chun Peter kuomah, “Nang khawm hi mipa inchûktir laia ṭhang ve i ni maw?” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka ni nawh,” a ta."
"Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.","Chun, suokhai le manmihai chu chutaka chun an ngîr tâwl a, a dei leiin meihawlin mei an sêm a, a lum an awi a, Peter khawm anni lai a ṭhang a, ngîr pumin mei lum a awi veh a."
"The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun Isu chu a inchûktirhai chanchin le a închûktirzie chanchin ân dawn a."
"Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.","Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Khawvêl kuomah, tlâng hrietah thu ka hril hlak kha; inkhâwmna in le, Pathien biekin, Juda po po um khâwmnaahai chun, kân chûktir rawp hlak kha, iengkhawm inrûkin ka hril nawh."
"Why askest thou me? ask them that have heard me, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.","Iengdinga kei i mîn dawn am? An kuomah ka thu hrilzie chu ka thu hretuhai indawn rawh; ngai rawh, chuonghai chun ka thu hril chu an hriet annâwm,” a ta."
"And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?","Chu chu a hril phingleh, a kâwla ngîr manmi pakhatin Isu a ben a, “Thiempu Laltak hieng ang hin i dawn maw?” a ta."
"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?","Isûn a kuomah, “Thu suol ka hril leh, ka suolna mîn hriettir rawh, nisienlakhawm, thu ṭha ka hril khawmin iengdinga i mi ben am?” a ta, a dawn a."
Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.,"Chun, Ana chun khuop pumin Thiempu Laltak Kaiapha kuomah a tir a."
"Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.","Chun, Simon Peterin ngîrin mei lum a awi a. Chun, “Nang khawm a inchûktir laia ṭhang ve i ni maw?” an ta. Ama chun, “Ka ni nawh,” tiin ân phah a."
"One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?","Chun, Thiempu Laltak suok pakhat, Peterin a nakâwr a sât thlâk pêkpa laibungpa chun, “A kuomah huona khan ka hmu naw che am a nih?” a ta."
Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.,"Chuongchun, Peter ân pha nâwk a, âr a khuong tah a."
"They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Prætorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Prætorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.","Chun, Isu chu Kaiapha ina inthawk chun lal inah an ṭhuoi nâwk a. Zingkâr a na; chun anni chu lal inah an lût nawh, chuong naw chun, inthieng naw nîng an ta, Fekân Ruoiṭhe fa thei naw ni hai."
"Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?","Chun, Pilat an kuomah a va suok a, an kuomah, “Hi mipa chunga hin thupawi ieng am in nei a?” a ta."
"They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hi mipa hi mi suol ni naw sien chu i kuomah hung ṭhuoi naw ning ungah,” an ta, an dawn a."
"Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:","Pilat chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn ṭhuoi unla, in dân angin a thu rêl ro,” a ta. Judahai chun a kuomah, “Keini thu chun tukhawm sukhlum dân a ni nawh,” an ta."
"that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.","(A thizie ding thu, Isûn a hril anga, a tlungna dingin)."
"Pilate therefore entered again into the Prætorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?","Chuongchun, Pilat chu a inah a lût nâwk a. Isu a ko a, a kuomah, “Judahai lal i ni maw?” a ta."
"Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?","Isûn “Hihi nanga lungril puoksuoka i hril am a ni, mi dangin an hril che, ka chunga thu hi?” a ta, a dawn a."
"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?","Pilatin, “Kei Juda am ka nih? nangma chihai le thiempu lalhaiin ka kuomah an hung ṭhuoi che a ni hi, thil ieng am i thaw hrim leh?” a ta, a dawn a."
"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.","Isûn, “Ka ram chu hi khawvêla mi hi a ni nawh; ka ram chu hi khawvêla mi hi ni sienla, ka rawi- haiin thâwng an tih, Judahai laia pêka ka um nawna dingin; nisienlakhawm, ka ram chu hitaka mi hi a ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.","Chun, Pilatin a kuomah, “Chu lal i ni am a nih?” a ta. Isûn, “Lal ka nizie i hril zing chu. Thutak inhriettir hi ka pieng san le khawvêla ka hung san a nih. Tukhawm thutaka mi taphawt chun ka thu an pawm hlak,” a ta."
"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.","Pilatin a kuomah, “Thutak chu ieng am a na?” a ta. Chun, chu thu chu a hril phingleh, Judahai kuomah a va suok nâwk a, an kuomah, “Iengkhawm a suol ka hmu nawh."
"But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?","Nisienlakhawm, Fekân Ruoi- ṭheah mi pakhat kân suopêk ding cheuin dân in nei; chuongchun, Judahai lal hi insuopêk lang cheu in nuom am?” a ta."
"They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.","Chun, anni chu an khêk nâwk a, “Hi mipa hi chu ni naw raw se, Barabba kha ni lem raw se,” an ta. Barabba chu suomhmang a nih."
"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.","Chun, chuong lai chun Pilatin Isu a ṭhuoi a, a vuok a."
"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;","Chun, sipaihai chun hling lukhum an phier a, an inkhumtir a, puon sen duk an insiltir bawk a,"
"and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.","chun, a kuomah an hung a, “Chibai, Judahai Lal,” an ta, an ben a."
"And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.","Pilat chu a suok nâwk a, an kuomah, “En ta u, iengkhawm a suol ka hmu nawh ti in hrietna dingin in kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi suok hi,” a ta."
"Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the man!","Chun, Isu chu hling lukhum le puon sen duk chu sil pumin a hung suok a. Chun, Pilatin an kuomah, “En ta u, mihriempa hi,” a ta."
"When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le manmi- hai chun ama an hmu phingleh an khêk a, “Krawsah hemde rawh, krawsah hemde rawh,” an ta. Pilatin an kuomah, “Nangnîn fepui unla, krawsah hemde ro; kei chu ieng khawm a suolna ka hmu si nawh,” a ta."
"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.","Judahai chun a kuomah, “Kan dân kawng khat a um, chu dân ang peiin Pathien Naua ân siem leiin, a thi ding a nih,” an ta, an dawn a."
"When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;",Pilatin chu thu chu a hrietin a ṭi nâwk zuol a;
"and he entered into the Prætorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.","a inah a lût nâwk a, Isu kuomah, “Khâwtienga mi am I nih a?” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a dawn nawh."
"Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?","Chun, Pilatin a kuomah, “Nangin kei i mi biek naw vei maw? Inthla thei che ka nih, krawsa hemde thei che ka nih ti i hriet naw am a nih?” a ta."
"Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.","Isûn, “Chungtienga inthawka pêk i ni naw chun, ka chunga hin thaw thei hrim hrim nei naw ti ni; chuleiin, i kuoma mi petu khan suol a phur zuol a nih,” a ta."
"Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.","Chun, chu chena inthawk chu Pilatin inthla a tum a, nisien- lakhawm, Judahai an khêk a, “Hi mipa hi în thla chun Kaisar ruolpa ni naw ti ni, tûkhawm lala insiem taphawt chu Kaisar do an nih,” an ta."
"When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.","Chun, Pilatin chuong thu chu a hriet phingleh Isu a ṭhuoi suok a, a hming Lungrem, Hebrai ṭawng chun Gabbatha an ta, chu hmuna chun rorêlna ṭhungphaah a ṭhung a."
"Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!","(Chun, chu ni chu Fekân Ruoiṭhe Inringlâwk ni a nih, nisa inding vêl a nih.) Chun, ama chun Judahai kuomah, “En ta u, in Lal hi,” a ta."
"They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cæsar.","Chun, anni chu an khêk a, “Sukbohmang rawh, sukbohmang rawh, krawsah hemde rawh,” an ta. Pilatin an kuomah, “In lal hi krawsah hemdêng ka ti maw?” a ta. Thiempu Lalhaiin, “Kaisar naw chu lal dang kan nei nawh,” an ta, an dawn a."
Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.,"Chuongchun, Pilatin krawsa hemde dingin ama chu an kuomah a pêk tah a."
"They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha:","Chuongchun, Isu chu an ṭhuoi tah a. Ama chun mâni ta dinga kraws putin, “Lu ru hmun,” an ti, Hebrai ṭawng chun Golgotha an ti, chu hmun chen chun a va suok a."
"where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.","Chutaka chun ama chu krawsah an hemdeh a, mi dang pahni khawm krawsah an hemde bawk a, a sîr tuokah pakhat ve vein, a laiah Isu."
"And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Chun, Pilatin lekha a ziek a, kraws lêr tieng a bel a, “NAZARETH ISU JUDAHAI LAL,” tiin ziek a nih."
"This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and in Latin, and in Greek.","Chu lekha chu Judahai a ṭhen tamtakin an tiem a; Isu krawsa an hemdena hmun chu khawpui kâwl a na, Hebrai ṭawng dâm, Rom ṭawng dâm, Grik ṭawng dâmin ziek a nih."
"The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.","Chuongchun, Judahai thiempu lalhai chun, Pilat kuomah “ ‘Judahai Lal,’ tiin ziek naw la, ‘Judahai Lal ka nih a tih,’ tiin ziek lem rawh,” an ta."
"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.","Pilat chun, “Ka ziek kha ka ziek zo tah,” a ta, a dawn a."
"The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.","Chun, sipaihaiin Isu chu krawsa an hemde zo chun, a silfênhai an lâk a, phêk liin an siem a, sipaihaiin phêk khatin an chang seng a; a zakuo an lâk bawk a. Zakuo chu ṭhuilo zakuo a na, a rînga inthawka a puma khâwng vawng a nih."
"They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.","Chuleiin, anni chun, “Kei thlêr nâwng ei tiu, tu ta tak ding am a na, ai sân lem ei tiu,” an in tih a, Pathien Lekha Thu, “Ka silfênhai an insem a, Ka zakuo dingin ai an sân a,” ti a tlungna dingin. Chuong thil chu sipaihaiin an thaw a nih."
"These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","Chun, Isu kraws kâwlah a nu le a nu zuorpuinu Mari, Kleopa nuhmei, le Mari Magdalin an ngîr a."
"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son!","Chun, Isûn a nu le a inchûktir a ihmangai kha a kâwla ngir a hmuh a, a nu kuomah, “Nuhmei, en ta, i naupa kha!” a ta."
"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.","Chun, inchûktir kuoma khawm chun, “En ta, i nu kha!” a ta. Chun, chu chena inthawk chu, chu inchûktir chun amanu chu a inah a ṭhuoi tah a."
"After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.","Chu hnunga chun Isûn thil iengkim tuhin a kim tah ti a hriet a, Pathien Lekha Thu kha a tlungna dingin, “Ka dang a châr ie,” a ta."
"There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.","Chutaka chun bêl pakhat uoin thûra sip an intung a, chuongchun sponj pakhat chu uoin thûra inchie sipin husop hmawlah an târ a, a hmûr an hang intlun a."
"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.","Chun, Isûn uoin thûr chu a lo dâwn zo chun, “A kin tah,” a ta. A lu a kûn a, a thlarau ân thla tah a."
"The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.","Chun, Inringlâwk ni a ni leiin, ruonghai chu Châwlnia krawsa a um zing nawna dingin, (chu Châwlni chu ni ropui a ni sih a,) Judahaiin Pilat kuomah an kehai suktlieka, an ruong fepui dingin an ngên a."
"The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:","Chun, sipaihai chu an hung a, a kuoma krawsa an hemde a tawntira mi le mi dang chu an kehai an suktliek a."
"but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:","Nisienlakhawm, Isu kuomah an hung a, a thi ta zing ti an hriet a, a kehai an suktliek ve nawh a."
"howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.","Nisienlakhawm, sipaihai laia mi pakhatin a nâkah feiin a sun a, chuongchun, thisen le tui a suok nghâl ta a."
"And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.","A hmutu chun ân hriettir tah (a thu inhriettir chu ân dik a nih, a hril indik ti khawm a hriet,) nangni khawmin in ringna dingin."
"For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.","Pathien Lekha Thu, “A ru pakhat khawm suktliek ni naw ni,” ti a tlungna dingin chuong thil chu a hung um tah a nih."
"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.","Chun, Pathien Lekha Thu dangin “An isun ngei chu la en an tih,” a ti bawk a."
"And after these things Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.","Chun, chuong thil thaw zo chun, Josef Arimathai khuoa mi, Isu inchûktir a nih, nisienlakhawm, Judahai a ṭi leiin a rûka um a na, ama chun Isu ruong chu fepui dingin Pilat kuomah a hnih a, chun Pilatin a phal a. Chuongchun, a hung a, a ruong chu a fepui tah a."
"And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.","Chun, Nikodem, (a tîra zâna a kuoma hung khan,) murra le aloe inpawlsa bûk sâwmnga lai chawiin a hung veh a."
"So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.","Chun, Isu ruong chu an lâk a, Judahai inphûm dân angin thil rim inhnikhai le chun puon zai inhmiin an tuom a."
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.,"Chun, krawsa an hemdena hmuna chun huon pakhat a um a, huona chun tukhawm lân zâlna ngainaw thlân thar pakhat a um."
There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.,"Chun, Judahai Inringlâwk ni a ni leiin, thlân chu an kâwl el a ni sih a, chutaka chun Isu chu an inzâl tah a."
And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:,"Chun, ni thum niah, Galili rama Kana khuoah inneina ruoiṭhe a um a, chutaka chun Isu nu a um a."
"and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.",Isu le a închûktirhai khawm inneinaa chun an fiel a.
"And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.","Chun, uoinin a dai ta nawh a, Isu nu chun a kuomah, “Uoin an tlasam tah ie,” a ta."
"And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.","Isu chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei, nanga mi lo hrietpêk ding ieng am a um a? ka hun a la tlung nawh,” a ta."
"His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.","Chun, a nu chun rawngbâwltu- hai kuomah, “In kuoma a hril taphawt chu thaw pei ro,” a ta."
"Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews’ manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.","Chun, Judahai inthien dân angin lung tuibêl paruk, bûk sâwmli hmun hni amanih, hmun thum amanih keng seng chutaka chun an intung a."
"Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tuibêl- ahai tui suksip ro,” a ta. A rei inruolin an suksip seng a."
"And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.","Chun, an kuomah, “Tuhin thâl unla, ruoiṭhe hotu kuomah fepui ro,” a ta. Chun, an fepui tah a."
"And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,","Chun, ruoiṭhe hotu chun tui uoina hung inchang chu ân tem a, a suokna chin a hriet nawh a, (tui thâl rawngbâwltuhai ruok chun an hriet a), nuhmei nei tupa chu a ko tah a,"
"and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.","a kuomah, “Mi tinin a tirin uoin ṭha an sie suok hlak, chun, a tam deu an dâwn hnungin a ṭha naw deu chu an sie suok hlak, nang ruok chun tu chen hin uoin ṭha i la nei zing a,” a ta."
"This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.","Isûn hi a thilmak thaw phutna hi Galili ram Kana khuoa chun a thaw a nih, a ropuizie ân langtir a; chun, a inchûktirhai chun ama chu an ring tah a."
"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.","Chun, chu hnunga chun, Kaper- naumah a zu fe a, ama le a nu leh, a unauhai le, a închûktirhai leh; chutaka chun ni sâwt nawtê an um a."
"And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","Chun, Judahai Fekân Ruoiṭhe a hnai tah a, Isu Jerusalemah a hang feh a."
"And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:","Chun, Pathien biekina se- bâwnghai, berâmhai, vaṭhuhai zawr- tuhai le tangka thlengtuhai ṭhung a hmuh a."
"and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables;","Chun, hruihruol invuokna a siem a, sebâwng le berâm an rêngin Pathien biekina inthawk chun a hnawt dawk a, tangka thlengtuhai tangka chu a bunthlâk a, an dawkânhai a nam thlûkpêk bawk a;"
"and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.","chun, vaṭhu zawrtuhai kuoma chun, “Hieng thilhai hi hitaka inthawkin fepui ro, ka Pa in sum- dâwngna inin siem naw ro,” a ta."
"His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.","Chun, a inchûktirhai chun, “I ina ka ṭhahnemngainân mi fa zo a tih” ti ziek a nih ti an hriet nâwk tah a."
"The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?","Chun, Judahaiin a kuomah, “Hieng thil i thaw hi inchikna ieng am i mîn hmutir thei a?” tiin ama an in dawn a."
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.","Isûn an kuomah, “Hi in hi sukseb unla, ni thum sûngin inngîr nâwk ka tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?","Chun, Judahai chun, “Hi in hi kum sâwmli paruk sûng bâwl a nih, nangin ni thum sûngin inngîr i ti maw?” an ta."
But he spake of the temple of his body.,"(Nisienlakhawm, a taksa in chu hril a lo ni lem sih a."
"When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.","Chuleiin, mithi laia inthawka a thonâwkin, chu thu chu a hril tah ti a închûktirhai chun an hriet nâwk tah a; chun, Pathien Lekha Thu le Isu thu hril chu an ring tah a)."
"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.","Chun, Fekân Ruoiṭhea Jerusa- lema a um lai chun, a thilmak thawhai an hmuh a, mi tamtakin a hming an ring tah a."
"But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,","Nisienlakhawm, Isu chu anni lai a ngam nawh, mi po po a hriet a."
and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.,"Mihriem thu tukhawm ihril a ngai nawh, ama chun mihriem sûnga um taphawt chu a hriet sih a."
"Now on the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.","Chun, ni saria ni hmasatakah, zîngkâr, khuo a lân thim laiin, Mari Magdalin chu thlâna chun a va feh a, lung chu thlâna inthawka lâk sawnin a hmuh a."
"She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.","Chuongchun, a tlân a, Simon Peter le inchûktir dang Isûn a ihmangai kuoma chun a hung a, an kuomah, “Thlâna inthawk khan Lalpa chu an fe hmangpui tah, an siena chin hrim kan hriet nawh,” a ta."
"Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.","Chuongchun, Peter chu a suok a, inchûktir dang le chun; chun, thlântieng an pan tah a."
"And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;","An tlân rêl a, inchûktir dang chun Peter a lekhêl a, thlân chu a tlung hmasah a."
"and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.","A kûn a, a bih a, puon zai inhmi um chu a hmuh a; nisienlakhawm, a sûngah a lût nawh."
"Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,","Chun, Simon Peter khawmin a hnungah a hung hnawt phâk a, thlân sûngah a lût a; puon zai inhmihai um le"
"and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.","a lua inhrûkna puon um chu, puon zai inhmihai laia um loin, ziel sain hmun tuma um a hmuh a."
"Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.","Chuongchun, inchûktir dang, thlân tlung hmasapa khawm chu a lût veh a, a hmuh a, a awi a."
"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.",Mithi laia inthawkin a thonâwk ding a ni ti Pathien Lekha Thu kha an la hriet si nawh a.
So the disciples went away again unto their own home.,"Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chu anni inah an fe nâwk tah a."
"But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;","Nisienlakhawm, Mari chu tuol- ah thlân kâwla chun ṭap pumin a ngîr a; chuongchun, ṭap pumin a kûn a, thlân sûng chu a bih a;"
"and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.","chun, vântirko pahni puon vâr silin, Isu ruong inzâlna hmuna chun, pakhat a lu tieng, pakhat a ke tienga ṭhung a hmuh a."
"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei, iengdinga i ṭap am?” an ta. Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka Lalpa an fe- hmangpui a, an siena chin ka hriet naw leiin,” a ta."
"When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.","Chun, chuonga a hril phingleh a hnung tieng a nghah a, Isu ngîr chu a hmuh a, Isu a ni ti a hriet si nawh a."
"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.","Isûn a kuomah, “Nuhmei, ieng- dinga i ṭap am? Tû am i zawng a?” a ta. Ama chun huon enkawltu amanih a tih a, a kuomah, “Pu, ama hitaka inthawka i fepui a ni chun i siena chin mi hril rawh, chuongchun lâng ka tih,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.","Isûn a kuomah, “Mari,” a tih a. Ama chu a nghah a, a kuomah, Hebrai ṭawngin, “Rabboni,” a ta; (chu chu Inchûktirtu tina a nih.)"
"Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Mi chel naw rawh, tu chen khawmin Pa kuomah ka la hang fe nawh; amiruokchu, ka unauhai kuomah va fe la, an kuomah, ‘Ka pa, in Pa, Ka Pathien, in Pathien kuomah ka lâwn ding a nih,’ a tih, va ti rawh,” a ta."
"Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and that he had said these things unto her.","Mari Magdalin chu a va feh a, închûktirhai kuomah, “Lalpa chu kan hmu tah,” a ta, a kuoma thu a hrilziehai khawm chu a hril a."
"When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Chun, chu ni, ni saria ni hmasatakah, khuo a hung inhnu chun, Judahai ṭi leia inchûktirhai umna kawtkhârhai chu khâr a ni hnungin, Isu anni lai a hung ngîr a, an kuomah, “In chungah thla- muongna um raw se,” a ta."
"And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.","Chu chu a hril zo chun, a kut le a nâk an kuomah ân entir a. Chun, Lalpa chu an hmu chun inchûktirhai chu an lâwm tah a."
"Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “In chungah thlamuongna um raw se, Pain kei a mi tir ang bawkin ka tir cheu hi,” a ti nâwk a."
"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril zoin, an chungah ân thuok a, an kuomah, “Thlarau Inthieng nei ro,"
"whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.","tu suol khawm in ngaidam taphawt chu ngaidam nîng a tih; tu suol khawm in ngaidam naw taphawt chu, ngaidam naw nîng a tih,” a ta."
"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.","Chun, Isu a hung lai khan, sâwm le pahnihai laia ṭhang ve Thoma (Didum an ti bawk) chu an kuomah a um ve nawh a."
"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.","Chuongchun, inchûktir danghai chun a kuomah, “Lalpa chu kan hmu tah,” an ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “A kuta thîr kilna serhai kha ka hmuh a, thîr kilna serhaia chun ka kut pârhai ka khîk lûta, a nâka ka pur meu naw chun, ring naw ning,” a ta."
"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.","Chun, ni riet hnungah, a inchûktirhai chu in sûngah an um nâwk a, Thoma khawm an kuomah a um veh a. Chun, Isu a hung a, kawthai chu khâr a ni sih a, anni lai a hung ngîr tah a, an kuomah, “In chungah thlamuongna um raw se,” a ta."
"Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.","Chun, Thoma kuoma chun, “I kut pârin hang them la, ka kuthai en rawh; i kut hang ban la, ka nak pur rawh; ring loin um naw la, ring el rawh,” a ta."
"Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.","Thoman a kuomah, “Ka Lalpa le ka Pathien i nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.","Isûn a kuomah, “Nangin kei i mi hmu leiin i ring a ni maw? Hmu loa ring taphawthai chu an hamṭha,” a ta."
"Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:","Chun, Isûn inchûktirhai hmaah inchikna dang tamtak a thaw ṭeu a, chuonghai chu hi lekhabua hin ziek a ni nawh."
"but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.","Nisienlakhawm, hieng hi, Isu chu, Krista, Pathien Naupa a nih ti in ringna ding le, in ring a, a hminga hringna in neina dinga ziek a nih."
After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself on this wise.,"Chun chu hnunga chun, Tiberi dîlah Isu a inchûktirhai kuomah ân lâr nâwk a; hieng ang hin ân lâr;"
"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.","Simon Peter hai, Thoma (Didum an ti bawk) hai, Galili rama Kana khuoa mi Nathanael hai, Zebedai naupahai pahni, a închûktirhai pahni dang leh an um khâwm a."
"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.","Simon Peter chun an kuomah, “Nga manin ka fe ding a nih,” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Keini khawm i kuomah hung vêng kan tih,” an ta. An fe suok a, lawngah an chuong a; chu zân chun iengkhawm an man nawh."
"But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.","Chun, khawfing chatin Isu ṭieuphoah a ngîr a; nisienlakhawm, a închûktirhai chun Isu a nih ti an hriet si nawh."
"Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Nauhai, iengkhat fâk ding in nei am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Nei lo,” an ta, an dawn a."
"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Lawng sîr changtieng khan lên dêng unla, hmûng in tih,” a ta. Chun, an dêng a, nga tam lei chun an kei dawk zo ta nawh a."
"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.","Chuongchun, inchûktir Isûn a ihmangai khan Peter kuomah, “Lalpa a ni saw,” a ta. Chuongchun, Lalpa a nih ti Simon Peter chun a hriet phingleh, a silfên ân bel a, (ruoka um a ni sih a,) dîlah ân châwm thla tah a."
"But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net full of fishes.","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktir dang- hai chun lawng chîtê têhai chun, lên nga puma hnûk pei pum chun an hung pan a, (khawmuola inthawkin a hla si nawh a, tawng za hni amani chau a nih)."
"So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.","Chun, khawmuola an suok phingleh, chutaka chun meihawla mei insêm an hmuh a, a chunga nga le beiphêk raw leh."
"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tuhin in nga man kha a ṭhen hung la ro,” a ta."
"Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.","Chuongchun, Simon Peter a va chuong a, lên chu nga lien tak taka sipin khawmuolah a hnûk dawk a, za le sâwmnga le pathum a nih; chuong zât zât um sien khawm lên chu ân ek si nawh."
"Jesus saith unto them, Come and break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Zîngbu hung fa ro,” a ta. Inchûktirhai laia tukhawmin a kuomah, “Tu am i na?” tiin an indawn ngam nawh, Lalpa a nih ti an hriet zing a."
"Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.","Chun, Isu a hung a, beiphêk chu a lâk a, an kuomah a pêk a, ngahai khawm chu chuong ang bawkin a pêk a."
"This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.",Chu chu Isu mithi laia inthawk- a a thonâwk hnunga a închûktirhai kuoma ân lâr a vawi thumna a nih.
"So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.","Chun, zingbu an fâk zoin, Isûn Simon Peter kuomah, “Simon, Johan naupa, hienghai nêk hin nangin kei i mi hmangai lem am?” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Aw, Lalpa, ka ngaina che ti I hriet,” a ta. Ama chun a kuom- ah, “Ka berâmtehai châwm rawh,” a ta."
"He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.","A vawihninaah, a kuomah, “Simon, Johan naupa, nangin kei i mi hmangai am?” a ti nâwk a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Aw, Lalpa, ka ngaina che ti i hriet,” a ti nâwk a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Ka berâmhai enkawl rawh,” a ta."
"He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.","A vawithumnaa chun, “Simon, Johan naupa, nangin kei i mi ngaina am?” a ta. Chun, a vawithumnaah “Nangin i mi ngaina am,” a kuoma a ti lei chun Peter a lungngai a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, iengkim i hriet a, ka ngaina che ti i hriet,” a ta. Isûn a kuomah, “Ka berâmhai châwm rawh."
"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che, i naupang lai khan i kâwngah în khit a, i nuomna tieng tieng i fe hlak; nisienlakhawm, i upat pha i kuthai phar i ta, mi dangin khitpêk an ti cheh a, i nuom nawna tieng kei an ti che,” a ta."
"Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.","Chuong thu chu iengtiziea thiin am Pathien a chawimawi ding ti inhriettirna dingin a hril a nih. Chun, chu chu a hril zoin a kuomah, “Mi zui rawh,” a ta."
"Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?","Chun, Peter chu a nghah a, Isûn inchûktir a ihmangai, zânbu fâk laia a âwm hnenga hung thlea, “ân mantirtu ding che chu tu tak am nîng a ta?” titu khan a hung zui a hmuh a."
"Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?","Peterin ama chu a hmu chun Isu kuomah, “Lalpa hi mipa hin ieng am thâwng a ta?” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.","Isûn a kuomah, “Ka hung nâwk chena um zing dingin dit lang lem chu, chu chu ienga i hmang ding am a na? Nangin mi zui el rawh,” a ta."
"This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?","Chuongchun, chu inchûktir chu thi naw dingin a thu unauhai lai ân thang tah a. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn thi naw ni ti a kuomah a hril si nawh, “Ka hung nâwk chena um zing dingin dit lang lem chu, chu chu ienga i hmang ding am a na?” a ti el a ni sih a."
"This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.",24 Chu inchûktir chu hieng thu ziektu le inhriettirtu hi a nih; a thu inhriettir hi indiktak a nih ti ei hriet.
"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.","Chun, hieng naw hi Isu thilthaw dang tamtak a la um, chuongchu ziek fai vawng ding ni sien, lekhabu ziek ding po po chu khawvêla khawm hin inlengin ka ring nawh."
"Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:","Chun, Pharisaihai laia mi, a hming Nikodem, Judahai hotu pakhat a um a;"
"the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.","ama chu zânah Isu kuomah a hung a, a kuomah, “Rabbi, Pathiena inthawka inchûktirtua hung i ni ti kan hriet; Pathien an chungah a um naw chun hieng thilmak i thawhai hi tukhawmin thaw thei naw ni hai,” a ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Titak- zetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi mi tûkhawm an pieng thar naw chun, Pathien ram hmu thei naw ni hai,” a ta."
"Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?","Nikodemin a kuomah, “Mi a tar hnungin iengtin am pieng thei a ta? A nu sulah vawi hni lûtin a pieng ding am a nih?” a ta."
"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.","Isûn a dawn a, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi, mi tûkhawm tuia le Thlaraua an pieng naw chun Pathien ramah lût thei naw ni hai,"
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.,"tisaa pieng taphawt tisa a nih, Thlaraua pieng taphawt chu thlarau a nih."
"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.",In pieng thar ding ka ti che hi mak ti naw rawh.
"The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.","Thli khâwlai khawm a nuom nuomin a hrâng hlak, a ri i hriet deh, nisienlakhawm, khâwtaka inthawka hung am, khâwlai am a fe ding ti i hriet si nawh; tûkhawm Thlaraua pieng chu chuong ang chu an nih,” a ta."
"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?","Chun, Nikodemin a dawn a, a kuomah, “Chuong thil chu iengtin am um thei a ta?” a ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?","Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Israelhai inchûktirtu i ni sih a, chuong chu i hriet naw maw?"
"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi, keinîn kan hriet chu kan hril hlak, kan hmu chu kan inhriettir hlak; nisienlakhawm, kan thu inhriettir in awi ngai si nawh."
"If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?","Khawvêla thil ka hril hmana awi lo cheu a, vâna thil hril lang cheu iengtin am awi in ta?"
"And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven.","Vânah tukhawm an lâwn ngai nawh, vâna inthawka hung ṭum Mihriem Naupa chau naw hi chu."
"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;","“Chun, Mosiein thlalêra rûl a khai kâng ang khan, Mihriem Naupa hi khai kângin a um bawk ding a nih;"
that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.,tûkhawm a ring taphawt chun ama leia chatuona hringna an neina dingin.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.","Pathienin khawvêl a hmangai bêk bêk a, chuongchun, a Naupa khât nei sun chu a pêk a, ama chu tûkhawm a ring taphawt chu an bohmang nawh a, chatuona hringna an nei lemna dingin."
For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.,"Khawvêl thiemnaw inchangtir dingin Pathienin a Nau khawvêlah a tir nawh, khawvêl ama leia an dam theina dingin a tir a ni lem."
"He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.","“Tûkhawm ama ring chu inthiemloin um naw ni hai, tukhawm a ring naw chu tuta inthawkin in- thiemloin an um nghâl a nih, Pathien Naupa khât nei hming an ring naw leiin."
"And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.","Hi hi thiemnawna a nih, var khawvêlah a hung a, nisienlakhawm, mihaiin var nêkin inthim an dit lem a, an thilthawhai a suol leiin."
"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.","Tûkhawm thil suksuol taphawt chun var an theida hlak, vara khawm an hung nawh, chuong naw chun, an thilthawhai inlang a tih."
"But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.","Amiruokchu tûkhawm a thaw dik phawt chu, an thilthawhai Pathien leia thaw an ni ti ân langna dingin, varah an hung hlak,” a ta."
"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.","Chuong hnunga chun Isu chu a inchûktirhai leh Judai ramah an feh a, chutaka chun Isu an kuomah a um zing a, a baptis hlak a."
"And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.","Johan khawmin Ainonah, Salim kâwlah, a baptis bawk a, chutaka chun tui a tam leiin, chun, mi an hung a, baptisma an chang tâwl a."
For John was not yet cast into prison.,Chuong lai chun Johan intâng- na inah an la khum si nawh.
There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.,"Chun, Johan inchûktirhai le Juda pakhat inthien dân thuah an lo insêl a."
"And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.","Johan kuomah an hung a, a kuomah, “Rabbi, Jordan râla i kuoma um, a thu mi în hriettir khan, ngai ta, kha pa khan mi a baptis a, mi po po a kuomah an hung a nih,” an ta."
"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.","Johanin a dawn a, “Mihriemin iengkhawm an nei thei nawh, vâna mi pêk a ni naw chun,"
"Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.","‘Kei Krista ka ni nawh, a hmaa mi tir ka nih,’ ka ti kha nangni ngei a mi hrietpuitu in nih."
"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.","Moneitu chu a pasal chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, pasal ṭhien ngîr puma a thu hretu chu, pasal râwl leiin a lâwm bêk bêk hlak; hi ka lâwmna a tlung tah a ni hi."
"He must increase, but I must decrease.","Ama chu tlatlum ding a nih, kei ruok chu inlâng ding ka nih."
"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.","“Chung tienga hung chu mi po po nêka chunghnungtak a nih; hnuoia pieng chu hnuoia mi a nih, hnuoi thu a hril hlak, vâna inthawka hung chu mi po po nêka chunghnungtak a nih."
"What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.",A hmu le a hriet taphawt ân hriettir hlak a nih; tukhawmin a thu inhriettir an awi nawh.
"He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this, that God is true.","A thu inhriettir awi chun, ‘Pathien chu mi indiktak a nih,’ tiin a hming namin a ziek."
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.,Pathien itir chun Pathien thu a hril hlak; ama chu Pathienin inkhi kherin Thlarau a pêk si nawh.
"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.","Pa chun Nau a hmangai a, a kutah iengkim a rêngin a pêk tah."
"He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.","Tûkhawm Nau ring taphawt chun chatuona hringna an nei tah, nisienlakhawm, tûkhawm Nau thu awi naw taphawt chun hringna nei naw hi hai, Pathien lunginsenna an chungah a um zing lem a nih,” a ta."
When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John,"Chun, Isûn Johan nêkin inchûktir tam lem a siem le a baptis ti Pharisaihaiin an hriet ti Lalpa chun a hriet phingleh,"
"(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),","(nisienlakhawm, Isu meu chun a baptis nawh a, a închûktirhaiin an baptis lem hlak),"
"he left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.","Judai ram chu a fe san a, Galili ramah a fe tah a."
And he must needs pass through Samaria.,"Chuongchun, Samari ram a fe thleng ding a na."
"So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:","Chuongchun, Samari ram khaw pakhat, Sukar an ti chu a hung tlung a, Jakobin a nau Josef kuoma hmun a ipêk kâwl kha."
"and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.","Jakob tuisunsuo khawm kha chutaka chun a um. Chuongchun, Isu chu a fe sâwl leiin tuisunsuo sîra chun a ṭhung chawt a; sûn bufâk pha a nih."
"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.","Samari nuhmei pakhat tui chawi dingin a hung a, Isûn a kuomah, “Dâwn ding mi pe rawh,” a ta."
For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.,(A închûktirhai hlak chu fâk ding inchaw dingin khuoah an fe ta sih a.)
"The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)","Chuongchun, Samari nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Nang Juda mi i na, kei Samari nuhmei ka ni sih a, iengtizie am a na, ka kuoma dâwn ding i hnih?” a ta. (Judahaiin Samari mihai ieng khawm an inṭâwmpui ngai si nawh.)"
"Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Pathien thilpêk le, ‘Dâwn ding mi pe rawh,’ i kuoma titu hi hre la chu nangin a kuomah i hni lem ding a nih; chun, ama chun tui hring a pêk ding che a nih,” a ta."
"The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pu, khaina iengkhawm i nei si nawh a, tuisunsuo ân thûk vei leh, khâwlaia inthawkin am tui hring chu i hmuh a?"
"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?","Kan pu Jakob nêkin i ropui lem am a nih? Ama chun hi tuisunsuo hi a mi pêk a, ama khawmin a dâwn a, a nauhai le a ranhai leh,” a ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Tûkhawm hi tui dâwn taphawt chu an dang châr nâwk a tih;"
but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.,"tûkhawm an kuoma ka pêk ding tui dâwn taphawt ruok chu, kum- khuoin dangchâr naw ni hai, keiin an kuoma tui ka pêk ding chu, an sûngah tuihnâr hung um a ta, chatuona hringna chenin inchik dawk a tih,” a ta."
"The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pu, chu tui chu mi pe rawh, ka dangchâr nawna ding le hi chen chena tui chawi dinga ka hung nawna dingin,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “I pasal va ko la, hitakah hung nâwk rawh,” a ta."
"The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pasal ka nei le,” a ta, a dawn a. Isûn a kuomah, “Pasal ka nei le, i ti hi i ti dik ie;"
for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.,"pasal panga i nei tah, tuta mi i nei hi i pasal a ni naw hrim a nih, hi thu hi i ti dik ie,” a ta."
"The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.","Nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pu, zâwlnei i nih ti ka hriet tah."
"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.","Keini thlatuhai chun hi tlânga hin Pathien chibai an bûk hlak; nisienlakhawm, nangni chun, ‘Mihriemin Pathien chibai an bûkna hmun ding chu Jerusalemah a um,’ in ti hlak,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Nu- hmei, ka thu awi rawh, hi tlânga kher naw khawm, Jerusalema kher naw khawm, Pathien chibai in bûk hun a tlung ding a ni tah."
Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.,"Nangnîn in hriet naw chibai in bûk hlak, keini chun chu kan ihriet chu chibai kan bûk hlak. Sandamna Judahaia inthawkin a hung suok ding a ni sih a."
"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.","Chuongchun, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, tu khawm hin a tlung zing tah, chu pha chun Pathien chibai bûktu taktakhaiin thlarau le titaktakin Pa chibai bûk an tih, Pa chun chuong ang mi chu ama chibai bûktu dingin a zawng a nih."
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.,"Pathien chu Thlarau a nih; ama chibai bûktuhaiin thlarau le titak- takin chibai an bûk ding a nih,” a ta."
"The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Messie, Krista an ti chu a hung ding a nih ti ka hriet a, ama chu a hung phaleh iengkim mi la hril a tih,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Kei a betu che hi ama chu ka ni annâwm,” a ta."
"And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?","Chuong lai chun a închûktirhai chu an hung a, nuhmei a biek chu mak an ti hleh a; nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin, “Ieng am i zawng? Ieng- dinga nuhmei i biek am?” khawm an ti nawh."
"So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,","Chun, nuhmei chun a tuibêl a mâksan a, khuoah a feh a, mihai kuomah,"
"Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ?","“Ka thilthaw taphawt mi hril peitu mi pakhat a um a, hung unla, en ta u, Krista a ni thei âwm am?” a ta."
"They went out of the city, and were coming to him.","Chun, anni chu khuoa inthawk chun an hung suok a, a kuom tieng an pan tah a."
"In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.","Chu kâr chun inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, fa rawh,” an lo ti an lo tih a."
"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Bu in hriet naw fâk ding ka nei,” a ta."
"The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?","Chun, inchûktirhai chu an inbiek a, “A fâk ding miin an hung chawipêk am a ni aw,” an in tih a."
"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah a hril a, “A mi tirtu dit zâwng thaw le, a sin thaw zo ding hi ka bu a nih."
"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.","Nangnîn, ‘Bu sîkna ding thla li a la um,’ in ti a ni naw am a ni? Ngai ro, ka hril cheu hi, dâk unla, lohai en ro, tuta inthawkin sîk dingin a hmin a nih."
"He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.","A sîktu chun hlaw a hmu hlak a, chatuona hringna chena um dingin ra a sîk hlak, a tutu le a sîktu an lâwm rêl theina dingin."
"For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.","‘Pakhatin a tuh a, mi dangin a sîk hlak,’ ti thu hi, chutaka chun ân dik hle a nih."
"I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.","In inrimpui naw sîk dingin ka tir cheu hi; mi dangin a thawh a, nangnîn a thawsa chu in sunzawm a nih,” a ta."
"And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did.","Chun, nuhmei chun, “Ka thil- thaw po a mi hril pei,” tia ân hriet- tirna thu lei khan, chu khuoa um Samari mi tamtakin Isu an ring tah a."
"So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.","Chuongchun, Samari mihai chu Isu kuomah an hung a, an kuoma um dingin an ngên an ngên a; chuongchun, chutaka chun ni hni a châm a."
And many more believed because of his word;,"Chun, mi dang tamtakin ama thu leiin an ring ve tah a."
"and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.","Chun, anni chun, nuhmei kuoma chun, “Tu zet hin chu i thu hril leia ring kan ni ta nawh; keini ngeiin a thu hril kan hriet tah a, hi mipa hi khawvêl Sandamtu a ni ngei ti kan hriet tah,” an ta."
And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.,"Chun, chu ni hni hnunga chun chutaka inthawkin a suok a, Galili ramah a fe tah a."
"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.","Isu ngeiin, zâwlnei chu ama khuo tieng chun chawimawiin a um ngai nawh ti ân hriettir hlak sih a."
"So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.","Chuongchun, Galili ram a hung tlungin Galili rama mihaiin an lo lâwm a, Jerusalema ruoiṭhe laia a thilthaw po po an hmu lei khan; anni khawm chu ruoiṭhenaa chun an fe ve sih a."
"He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.","Chun, Galili rama Kana khuo, tui uoina ân changtirna kha a hung tlung nâwk a. Chun, upa tû amanih a um a, a naupa Kapernaumah a damnawh a."
"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.","Chun, Isu Judai rama in- thawkin Galili ramah a hung ti a hriet phingleh a hang feh a, a naupa zu sukdam dingin a ngên a, a thi vâng vâng sih a."
"Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.","Isûn a kuomah, “Inchiknahai le thilmakhai in hmu naw chun ring tawp naw ti niu,” a ta."
"The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.","Chun, upa chun a kuomah, “Pu, ka nau thi hmain hung thla ta la,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.","Isûn a kuomah, “Fe nâwk el ta rawh, i naupa chu a dam tah ie,” a ta. Ama chun Isûn a kuoma thu a hril chu a ring a, a fe tah a."
"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.","Chun, a fe thlâk lai zingin a suokhaiin ama an lo tuok a, “I naupa chu a dam tah,” an lo tih a."
"So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.","Ama chun an kuomah a dam phut hun lai ân dawn a. Anni chun a kuomah, “Zâni nisa inhêm chau khan a khawsik a bo tah a nih,” an ta."
"So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.","Chuongchun, a pain Isûn a kuoma, “I naupa chu a dam tah ie,” a ti lai tak chu a nih, ti a hriet tah a; chun, ama le a sûnghaiin an rêngin an ring tah a."
"This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judæa into Galilee.","Chu chu Isu thilmak a thaw vawi hnina a nih, Judai rama inthawka Galili rama a hungin."
After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.,Chuong thil hnunga chun Judahai ruoiṭhe pakhat a um a; Isu Jerusalemah a hang feh a.
"Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.","Chun, Jerusalema chun berâm kawtkhâr kâwlah dîl a um a, chu chu Hebrai ṭawngin Bethesda an tih a, tuolpûk panga a nei a."
"In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered.","Chuonga chun damnawhai, mitdelhai, ke inbaihai, zenghai tamtak an zâl tâwl a, [tui infâwn hun an nghâk a."
,"Akâr po leh dîla chun vântirko a zu feh a, tui chu a sukfâwn hlak a; mi tukhawm ieng ang natna nei khawm ni hai sien, tuifâwn zu pal hmasatak taphawt chu an dam pei hlak sih a.]"
"And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.","Chutaka chun, kum sâwm thum pariet natna nei mi tu amanih a um a."
"When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?","Isûn a zâl chu a hmuh a, chuong ang chun sâwttak a um tah ti a hriet a, a kuomah, “Sukdam i nuom am?” a ta."
"The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.","Chun, damnaw chun, “Pu, tui a hung fâwn pha dîla mi sietu ding ka nei nawh a, ka fe sûngin mi dangin an mi fe khêl nâwk hlak,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Tho la, i puonpha la la, kein lâwn ta rawh,” a ta."
"And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.","Chun, kârloin ama chu a dam nghâl tah a, a puonpha a lâk a, a fe tah a. Chu ni chu Châwlni a na."
"So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.","Chuongchun, Judahaiin suk- dama um kuoma chun, “Châwlni a ni hi, i puonpha i lâk a thieng nawh ie,” an ta."
"But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.","Ama chun an kuomah, “A mi sukdamtu ngeiin ka kuomah, ‘I puonpha la la, kein lâwn ta rawh,’ a mi ti a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?","Anni chun a kuomah, “ ‘I puon- pha la la, kein lâwn ta rawh,’ titu che chu tu am a na?” an tih a, an indawn a."
"But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.","Nisienlakhawm, sukdama um chun tû a ni a hriet nawh a, chutaka chun mipui an um leiin Isu a fe hmang ta sih a."
"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.","A nakie chun ama chu Isûn Pathien biekinah a hmuh a, a kuomah, “Ngai rawh, i dam ta hi, thil suksuol nâwk ta naw rawh, chuong- naw chun, thil ṭha naw nâwk zuol i chungah hung um rawi a tih,” a ta."
"The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.","Chun, ama chu a va feh a, Judahai kuoma chun, ama sukdamtu chu Isu a nih ti a hril a."
"And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.","Chuongchun, Châwlnia chuong thilhai chu a thaw leiin Judahaiin Isu an suknawmna tah a."
"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn anni chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Ka Pain tu chen khawmin sin a thaw hlak, kei khawmin ka thaw hlak,” a ta."
"For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.","Chun, Judahaiin sukhlum an tum nâwk zuol a, Châwlni a bawsiet lei chau khawm a ni nawh a, Pathien ama paah ân bûk a, Pathien tluka ân siem lei khawmin a nih."
"Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Naupa hin a khâtin iengkhawm a thaw thei nawh, Pa thilthaw a hmu chau naw chu; thil a thaw ang taphawt chu Naupa khawmin a thaw ve hlak."
"For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.","Pain Naupa a hmangai a, a thilthaw taphawt a kuomah ân entir hlak; hieng nêka thil ropui lem hi a kuomah lân entir a tih, mak in ti dingin."
"For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.","Pain mithihai a keithoa a sukhring hlak angin, Naupa khawm- in a nuom nuom a sukhring hlak."
"For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;","Pain tû thu khawm a rêlpêk ngai nawh, thu po po Naupa ân rêltir lem a;"
"that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.","mi po poin Pa an inza angin Naupa khawm an inzana dingin. Tûkhawm Naupa inza naw chu Pa, ama tirtu inza naw a nih."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.","“Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm ka thu hrea a mi tirtu ring chun chatuona hringna a nei tah, inthiemloin a um nawh a, thinaa inthawkin a suok a, hringnaah a lût lem tah a nih."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, tu khawm hin a tlung zing tah, chu pha chun mithihaiin Pathien Naupa râwl hrieng an ta, a hre taphawt hring an tih."
"For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:","Pa chun mânia hringna a nei ang bawkin, Naupa mânia hringna neiin a siem;"
"and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.","chun, Mihriem Naupa a ni leiin a kuomah rorêl ding thu a pêk."
"Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,","Hieng hi mak ti naw ro, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, chu pha chun thlâna um po poin a râwl hrieng an ta,"
"and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.","suok vawng an tih; thil ṭha thawtuhai chu hringna changin tho nâwk an ta, thil suol thawtuhai chu inthiemnawna changin tho nâwk an tih."
"I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.","“Keia khâtin iengkhawm ka thaw thei nawh; naa ka hriet ang peiin ro ka rêl hlak; ka rorêl chu indiktak a nih, keia thu thuin um ka tum nawh a, a mi tirtu thu thua um ka tum lem hlak leiin."
"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.","Mâni chanchin inhriettir lang, ka thu inhriettir indik naw ni."
It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.,Ka chanchin inhriettirtu chu mi dang a nih; ama chun ka chanchin ân hriettir chu ân dik ti ka hriet.
"Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.","“Nangnîn Johan kuomah mi in tir a, ama chun, thutak chanchin a lo inhriettir kha;"
"But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.","Thu inhriettir ka ipawm ruok chu mihriem thu a ni nawh, nisien- lakhawm, in damna dingin hieng thu hi ka hril a ni hi."
He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.,"Chu Johan chu khâwnvar chawktak le var tak a nih, a varah lân sukhlim in nuom kha."
"But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.","“Nisienlakhawm, inhriettirna ka nei hi Johan inhriettirna nêk khan a ropui lem a nih; Pain thil thaw zo dinga a mi pêk, ka thilthaw ngei hin Pain a mi tir a ni ti ka chanchin ân hriettir a nih."
"And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.","Pa a mi tirtu khawm chun ka chanchin ân hriettir tah. Nangnîn iengtik khawm a râwl in hriet ngai nawh, a hmêl khawm in hmu ngai nawh."
"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.",A thu khawm in lungrilah in pai zing ngai nawh; a itir hi in ring naw leiin.
"Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;","Pathien Lekha in tiem ngun hlak a, a sûnga chatuona hringna um dinga in ring leiin; chuong Lekha chu ka chanchin inhriettirna chu a ni sih a."
"and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.","Nisienlakhawm, hringna nei dingin ka kuomah in hung nuom si nawh."
I receive not glory from men.,“Mihriem ichawimawina ka pawm nawh.
"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.","Nangni ka hriet cheu, Pathien hmangaina in lungrilah in nei nawh ie."
"I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.","Ka Pa hmingin ka hung a, nangnîn in mi lâwm si nawh; mi dang mâni hmingin hung sienla, ama chu lâwm in tih."
"How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not?","“Nangni inchawimawituo lâwm- hai, iengtin am ring thei in ta? Pathien tak chaua suok chawi- mawina chu in zawng si nawh."
"Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.","Keiin Pa kuoma ka hêk cheu ring naw ro, nangni hêktu cheu chu pakhat a um, in iring Mosie hi."
"For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.","Mosie in ring chun, kei khawm mi ring ta ding in nih; ama chun keia chanchin in sawnnaw a ziek."
"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?","Nisienlakhawm, a thu ziek chu in ring si naw chun, iengtin am ka thu ring in ta?” a ta."
"After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.","Chuong thil hnunga chun Isu chu Galili dîl, Tiberi dîl an ti râlkhing tieng chun a fe tah a."
"And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.","Chun, damnaw chunga thilmak a thawhai chu an hmu leiin mipui tamtakin ama an zui a."
"And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.","Chun, Isu chu tlânga chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun a închûktirhai lai a ṭhung a."
"Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.",Fekân Ruoiṭhe (Judahai Ruoiṭhe chu) a hnai tah a.
"Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?","Chun, Isu a dâk a, mipui tamtakin a kuom tieng hung panin a hmuh a, Philip kuomah, “Hienghai fâk ding bei khâwlai am inchâwng ei ta?” a ta."
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.,Chuong thu chu ama infiena dingin a hril a nih; a thaw ding chu amân a hriet zing sih a.
"Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.","Philip chun a kuomah, “Mi tinin tlâwmtêa an chang seng ding khawm bei duli za hni manin dai naw ni,” a ta, a dawn a."
"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,","Chun, a închûktirhai laia mi pakhat Simon Peter unau Andri chun a kuomah,"
"There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?","“Buṭei beiphêk panga le nga pahni nei pasaltê pakhat hitaka hin a um; nisienlakhawm, mi hieng zozai lai hin chu chu ieng khawp am nîng a ta?” a ta."
"Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.","Chun, Isûn “Mihai chu inṭhung- tir ro,” a ta. Chu hmuna chun hlobet tamtak a um a. Chuongchun, patlinghai chu an ṭhung a; an tamzie chu sâng nga lai an nih."
"Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would.","Chun, Isûn beiphêkhai chu a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin a ṭhunghai lai chun a sem a, chuong ang bawkin ngahai khawm chu an dit tâwkin a sem bawk a."
"And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.","Chun, an khawp hnungin, a inchûktirhai kuoma chun, “Ieng khawm inhmang lo dingin a mahla nawihai kha rût ro,” a ta."
"So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten.","Chuongchun, an rût a, buṭei bei- phêk panga fatuhai fâk mahla chun bâwm sâwm le pahni an suksip a."
"When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.","Chun, mihai chun thilmak a thaw chu an hmu phingleh, “Hi mipa hi zâwlnei, khawvêla hung ding kha a ni ngei hi,” an ta."
"Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.","Chuongchun, ama chu lala siem dinga man el tumin an hung ding a nih ti Isûn a hriet a, tlângah ama khât chauin a tumin a fe nâwk tah a."
"And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea;","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, a închûktirhai chu dîla chun an zu feh a."
"and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.","Lawngah an chuong a, dîla chun Kapernaum an pan a. Khuo a hung inthim tah a, Isu hlak chu an kuom a la tlung si nawh."
And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.,Thlipui nasatak a hrâng leiin tui chu a fâwn insâng deu deu a.
"When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.","Chun, fîng sâwmhni panga amanih, fîng sâwmthum amanih an kar chun, Isu chu dîl chunga chun kea lâwna, lawng hung hnaiin an hmuh a, an ṭih a."
"But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Kei ka nih annâwm, ṭi naw ro,” a ta."
They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.,"Chuongchun, lawnga chun inchuongtir an nuom tah a; chun, kârloin lawng chun an pan khawmuol chu a tlung nghâl tah a."
"On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone","A zînga chun dîl râl khing tienga mipui ngîrhai chun, lawng pakhat naw chu lawng dang a um nawh a, Isu chu a închûktirhai lai lawnga chun a chuong ve nawh a, a închûktirhai anni khât chauin an fe ti an hriet a."
(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks):,"(Nisienlakhawm, Lalpain lâwm- thu a hril hnunga, bei an fâkna hmun kâwla khan Tiberi khuoa in- thawkin lawng chînhai a hung tlung sih a)."
"when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.","Chuongchun, mipui chun Isu le a închûktirhai chu an um ta nawh ti an hrietin, anni khawm lawng chîn- haia chun an chuong a, Isu zawngin Kapernaum an hung tlung a."
"And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?","Chun, dîl râla an hung hmu chun a kuomah, “Rabbi, iengtik am hi tieng i lo tlung a?” an tih a."
"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.","Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, thilmakhai in hmu leia mi zawng in ni nawh a, bei in fâk khawp leia mi zawng in ni lem hi."
"Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.","Bu bohmang nâwk el hlak zawng hin inlap rak rak naw ro, chatuona hringna chena um zing ding bu, Mihriem Naupain a pêk ding cheu chu zawng lem ro; Pa Pathien chun ama chu ân chik ta sih a,” a ta, a dawn a"
"They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Pathien sin kan thaw theina dingin ieng am thâwng kan ta?” an ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.","Isu chun an kuomah, “Pathien sin thaw chu hi hi a nih, a mi tir hi ring unla,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou?","Anni chun a kuomah, “Inchikna ieng am thâwng i ta, kan hmua kan ring theina ding chein? Thil ieng am thâwng i ta?"
"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.","Kan thlatuhaiin thlalêrah man- na kha an fâk hlak, ‘Vâna inthawk chun an kuomah bei fâk ding a pêk,’ ti ziek ang khan,” an ta."
"Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, vâna inthawka bei in hmu kha Mosie pêk cheu a ni nawh, ka Pa ruok chun vâna inthawkin bei tak tak a pêk cheu a ni hi."
"For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.","Pathien bei chu vâna inthawka hung ṭuma, khawvêl kuoma hringna petu hi a nih,” a ta."
"They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, chu bei chu kumkhuoin mi pe rawh,” an ta."
"Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei hi hringna bei chu ka nih, tûkhawm ka kuoma hung chu phîngṭâm naw ni, tûkhawm a mi ring chu iengtika khawm dangchâr naw ni."
"But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.","Nisienlakhawm, nangnîn in mi hmu khawma in mi ring si nawh ti ka hril cheu kha."
All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.,Pain a mi pêkhai po po ka kuomah hung vawng an tih; tûkhawm ka kuoma hung chu hnawt suok naw tawp ka tih.
"For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.","Mâni nuom zâwng thaw dinga vâna inthawka hung ka ni nawh a, a mi tirtu dit zâwng thaw dinga hung ṭum ka ni lem."
"And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.","Hi hi a mi tirtu dit zâwng chu a nih, amân a mi pêk po po iengkhawm inhmang naw lang, ni kin nia chun keitho lem lang."
"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.","Chun, hi hi ka Pa dit zâwng a nih, tûkhawm Nau hmua ring taphawt chun chatuona hringna nei sienla; chun, keiin ni kin nia chun ama chu kei tho lang,” a ta."
"The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.","Chun, “Vâna inthawka bei hung ṭum chu ka nih,” a ti leiin, Judahai chu a chungah an chier a."
"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven?","“Hi mipa hi Josef nau Isu a ni naw am a nih? A nu le Pa khawm ei hriet hi. ‘Vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka nih,’ iengti tia ti am a ni leh?” an ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Chier chier naw ro."
"No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.","Pa a mi tirtuin a hîp naw chun tukhawm ka kuomah hung thei naw ni hai; chun, keiin ni kin nia chun a hung chu keitho ka tih."
"It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.","Zâwlneihai Lekhabuah, ‘Pa- thien inchûktirin um vawng an tih,’ ti ziek a nih. Mi tin Pa thu hrea inchûk taphawt chu ka kuomah an hung hlak."

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm a ring chun chatuona hringna a nei tah a nih."
I am the bread of life.,Kei hi hringna bei chu ka nih.

"This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.","Hi hi vâna inthawka bei hung ṭum chu a nih, mîn a fâka a thi nawna dingin."
"I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.","Kei hi vâna inthawka bei hring hung ṭum chu ka nih, tûkhawmin hi bei hi a fâk chun chatuonin hring zing a tih, anih, khawvêl hringna dinga ka ipêk ding bei chu, ka taksa hi a nih,” a ta."
"The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?","Chuongchun, Judahai an insêl a, “Hi mipa hin iengtin am a taksa fâk dingin mi pe thei a ta?” an ta."
"Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Mihriem Naupa taksa in fâka, a thisen in dâwn bawk naw chun, nangni khâtin hringna nei nghâl lo cheu."
He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.,"Tûkhawm, ka taksa faa, ka thisen dâwn chun, chatuona hringna a nei tah, chun, ni kin nia chun ama chu keitho ka tih."
"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.","Ka taksa hi bu tak a na, ka thisen hi dâwn ding tak a ni sih a."

"As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.","Pa hring chun a mi tir a, Pa zâra hring ka ni ang bawkin, tûkhawm a mi fa chu keia zârin hring vêng a tih."
"This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever.","Hi hi vâna inthawka bei hung ṭum chu a nih, chi thlatuhaiin bei an fâk ang kha a ni nawh, anni chun an fâka, an thi tah a; tûkhawm hi bei hi fa chu chatuonin hring zing a tih,” a ta."
"These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.","Chuong thu chu inkhâwmna inah a hril a, Kapernauma ân chûktir lai khan."
"Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?","Chuongchun, a închûktirhai tamtakin chuongchu an hrietin, “Hi hi thu khir tak a nih, tuin am ngai phâk an ta?” an ta."
"But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble?","Chuongchun, chu thua chun a închûktirhai an chier ti Isûn a lungrilin a hriet a, an kuomah, “Hi thu hin a suklungninaw cheu am a nih?"

"It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.","Sukhringtu chu thlarau a nih, tisa chu ienga ṭhangkai a ni nawh; in kuoma thu ka hrilhai hi thlarau a nih, hringna khawm a nih."
"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia a ṭhen ring naw in um,” a ta. Isûn a ring nawtu le ama inmantirtu ding chu a tîra inthawkin a hriet zing sih a."

"Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.","Chu phingle chun a închûk- tirhai tamtak an fe hmang a, ama an pâwl nâwk ta nawh a."
"Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away?","Chuongchun, Isûn sâwm le pa- hnihai kuoma chun, “Nangni khawm fe hmang in nuom ve am?” a ta."

And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God.,"Nang Pathien mi inthieng chu i nih ti kan awi tah a, hriet khawm kan hriet ie,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Nangni sâwm le pahnihai hi keia thlang in ni naw am a nih? Nangni laia pakhat diebol a ni nâwk nghâl si,” a ta."
"Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.","(Simon Iskariot naupa Juda, sâwm le pahnihai laia ṭhang ve thu kha a hril a nih, ama chu ân mantirtu ding chu a ni sih a.)"
"And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him.","Chu zoa chun Isûn Galili ram a fang a, Judahaiin ama sukhlum an tum leiin Judai ram chu a fang nuom nawh a."
"Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.","Chun, Judahai Bâwktê Ruoiṭhe chu a hnai tah a."
"His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.","Chuongchun, a unauhaiin a kuomah, “Hitaka inthawkin Judai ramah va fe rawh, i închûktirhai khawmin i thilthaw hi an hmu theina dingin."

For even his brethren did not believe on him.,(A unauhai khawm chun ama an ring si nawh a).
"Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Ka hun a la tlung nawh; nangni hun ruok chu a tlung zing a nih."
"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.","Khawvêlin nangni an theida thei naw cheu, kei ruok chu an mi theida hlak, an thilthawhai a suol ti ka hrilfie hlak leiin."
Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.,"Nangni ruoiṭhenaah hang fe ro, kei chu hi ruoiṭhea hin la fe hri naw ning, ka hun a la tlung naw leiin,” a ta."
"And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.","Chun, chuong thu chu an kuomah a hril a, Galili ramah a la um zing a."
"But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.","Nisienlakhawm, a unauhai chu ruoiṭhenaa an hang fe hnung chun, ama khawm vântlâng ihriet loin, inrûkin a hang fe veh a."

"And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.","A chungah mipuihai laia mi an chier sup sup a, a ṭhenin, “Mi ṭha a nih ie,” an tih a; ṭhenkhatin, “Teu lo e, mipui a hlêm lem hlak a nih,” an ta."
Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.,"Nisienlakhawm, Judahai an ṭi leiin tûkhawmin a chungchâng thu an hril lang nawh."
"But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.","Chun, ruoiṭhe ṭhat lai takin, Isu Pathien biekinah a hang feh a, ân chûktir a."
"The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?","Chun, Judahaiin, “Hi mipa hin inchûk ngai loin iengtin am lekha a hriet a?” an ta, mak an ti hleh a."
"Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.","Chun, Isûn anni chu a dawn a, “Ka thu inchûktir hi ka ta a ni nawh a, a mi tirtu ta a ni lem."
"If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.","Tûkhawm ama dit zâwng thaw nuom chun, thu inchûktir hi Pathien suksuok am a ni, keia phuokfâwma ka hril, hrieng a tih."
"He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.","Tûkhawm mâni phuokfâwm thu hril chu mâni mawina zawng a nih; a tirtu mawina zawng ruok chu, ama chu mi tak zet a nih, amaa chun indik nawna hrim a um nawh."
"Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?","Mosiein Dân chu a pêk naw cheu am a nih? Nisienlakhawm, nangni lai tukhawmin Dân chu in hraw si nawh. Nangnîn iengdinga mi sukhlum in tum am?” a ta."
"The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?","Chun, mipui chun, “Khawhri zâwl i ni hi, tuin am sukhlum a tum che leh?” an ta, an dawn a."
"Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.","Isu chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Thil pakhat ka thaw kha nangni po poin mak in ti kha."
"Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.","Mosiein sertan thu kha a pêk cheu a, chu chu Mosie suksuok ni loin, thlâtuhai suksuok a ni lem. Chu lei chun a nih Châwlni khawma mi ser in tan hlak chu."
"If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?","Mosie Dân bawsiet nawna dingin Châwlnia khawm pasalin ser ân tantir si chun, keiin Châwlnia mi ka sukdam hieu leiin ka chungah in lunginsen bîk maw?"
"Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.","ân lang angin ngaituo naw unla, feltakin ngaituo lem ro,” a ta."
"Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?","Chun, Jerusalema mi ṭhen- khatin, “Hi mipa hi sukhlum an itum chu a ni naw am a nih?"
"And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?","En ta u, ân langin thu a hril a, a kuomah iengkhawm an hril si nawh. Ama hi Krista a ni ti hotuhaiin an hriet tak tak am a ni tah aw?"
"Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.","Hi mipa hi a piengna chenin ei hriet sih a, Krista ruok chu a tlung pha chun a piengna chin tukhawmin hre naw ni hai,” an ta."
"Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.","Chuong lei chun Isûn Pathien biekina ân chûktir malamin a khêk a, “Nangnîn in mi hriet, ka piengna chin khawm in hriet deh.

"I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.","Kei ruok chun ama chu ka hriet; a kuoma inthawka hung suok ka na, ama chun a mi tir a ni sih a,” a ta."
"They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.","Chuongchun, ama chu man an tum a, nisienlakhawm, a hun a la tlung naw leiin tukhawmin a chungah kut an thlâk si nawh."
"But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?","Mipui a ṭhen tamtak ruok chun ama chu an ring a, “Krista chu a hung tlung pha khawm, hi mipa thaw nêka tam thilmak a hung thaw ding am a nih?” an ta."
The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.,"Chun, Pharisaihaiin a chunga mipui chier rûknahai chu an hriet a, chuongchun, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chun ama man dingin manmihai an tir tah a."
"Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.","Chun, Isûn “Sâwt nawtê in kuomah la um hri phawt ka ta, chun a mi tirtu kuomah fêng ka tih."
"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.","Nangnîn mi zawng in ta, mi hmu si naw ti niu; ka umnaa khawm hung thei naw ti niu,” a ta."
"The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?","Chun, Judahai an inbiek a, “Ei hmu naw dingin hi mipa hi khâwlai am a fe ding a ni leh? Grikhai laia Inpêmdarhai laia fein Grikhai chu ân chûktir ding am nîng a ti?"
"What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?","‘Nangnîn mi zawng in ta, mi hmu si naw ti niu a; ka umnaa khawm hung thei naw ti niu,’ a ti hi, ieng a tina am a na?” an ta."
"Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.","Chun, ruoiṭhe ṭumṭiek ding ni, ni ropuitaka chun Isu a ngîr a, a khêk a, “Tûkhawm a dangchâr chun ka kuomah hung sienla, dâwn raw se."
"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.","Tûkhawm a mi ring chu Pathien Lekha hril angin, tui hring vadunghai a phînga inthawkin hung luong suok a tih,” a ta."
"But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.","(Chuong thu chu ama ring- tuhaiin Thlarau an nei dingzie thu a hrilna a nih; Thlarau chu pêk a la ni hri nawh, Isu chu chawimawia a la um hri naw leiin.)"
"Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.","Chuongchun, mipui laia ṭhen- khatin chuong thu chu an hrietin, “Hi mipa hi zâwlnei chu a ni ngei hi,” an ta."
"Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?","Ṭhenkhatin, “Hi hi Krista chu a nih,” an ta. Ṭhenkhatin, “Khâwlai am Krista chu Galili ramah hung suok hlak a ta?"
"Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?","Krista chu David thlahai laiah, David umna khuo Bethlehemah a suok ding a nih ti Pathien Lekhain a hril naw am a nih?” an ta."
So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.,"Chuongchun, ama leiin mipui chu an inṭheh a, an inkhing tah a."
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.,"Ṭhenkhat chun man an nuom a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin a chung- ah kut an thlâk si nawh."
"The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?","Chun, manmihai chu thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai kuomah an hung nâwk a, chun, anni chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga in hung ṭhuoi naw?” an lo tih a."
"The officers answered, Never man so spake.","Manmihai chun, “Hi mipa thuhril ang hrim hin tukhawmin thu an hril ngai nawh,” an ta, an dawn a."
"The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?","Chun, Pharisaihai chun an kuomah, “Nangni khawm hlêmin in um ve tah a ni maw chu?"
"Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?",Hotuhai le Pharisaihai laia mi hrim hrim ama ring an um ta am a nih?
But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.,"Hieng dân hre naw mipuihai hrep hi ṭawngsephur an nih in sawnnaw,” an ta, an dawn a."
"Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),","Nikodem, inhmaa Isu kuoma hung kha, anni laia ṭhang ve a na, an kuomah,"
"Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?",“Ama bau ngeia a thu hriet le a thilthaw hriet hmain ei dânin mi thiemnaw ân changtir hlak am a nih?” a ta.
"They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Nang khawm chu Galili mi i ni ve am a nih? Zawng la, Galili rama chun zâwlnei tukhawm an suok ngai nawh ti hrieng i tih,” an ta, an dawn a."
[And they went every man unto his own house:,"[Chun, mi tin mâni in sengah an fe tah a."
but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.,Isu ruok chu Oliv tlângah a fe ta lem a.
"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.","Chun, zingkâr inhmatakin Pathien biekinah a lût nâwk a, mi po po a kuomah an hung a; chun, ama chu a ṭhung a, anni ân chûktir a."
"And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihaiin nuhmei pakhat a uiret leia an man an hung ṭhuoi a; a laiah an inngîrtir a."
"they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.","Isu kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, hi nuhmei hi a uiret lai an man a nih, a uiret lai takin."
Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?,Dân Lekhabuah Mosiein hieng ang mi hi lunga dêng hlum thu a mi pêk a; nangin iengtin am i ngai a?” an ta.
"And this they said, trying him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.","Chu thu chu ama fiena dingin an thaw a nih, a hêkna ding an hmu theina dingin. Chuongchun, Isu a kûn a, a kutpârin hnuoiah a ziek a."
"But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.","Chun, an indawn sek sek leiin ama chu a tho a, an kuomah, “Nangni laia suol nei naw naw chun ama chu lungin dêng hmasa raw se,” a ta."
"And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.","Chun, a kûn nâwk a, a kutpârin hnuoi a ziek nâwk a."
"And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.","Chun, anni chun a thu hril chu an hrietin, a upatakin a phut a, a tâwp chenin, pakhat khatin an inrel hmang ta pei a; chuongchun, Isu chau a um tah a, nuhmei a laia a umna ngaia um le khan."
"And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?","Chun, Isu a tho a, a kuomah, “Nuhmei, khâwlai am an um tah a? Tukhawmin thiemnaw an inchangtir naw che a ni maw?” a ta."
"And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.]","Ama chun, “Lalpa, tukhawmin an mîn changtir nawh,” a ta. Chun, Isûn, “Kei khawmin thiemnaw kân changtir naw che; fe la, tuta hnung chu suksuol nâwk ta naw,” a ta.]"
"Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah thu a hril nâwk a, “Kei khawvêl êntu ka nih, tûkhawm a mi zui chu inthimah lêng tawp naw ni; hringna var nei lem a tih,” a ta."
"The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihaiin a kuomah, “Mâni thu inhriettir i nih, i thu inhriettir ân dik nawh,” an ta."
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.","Isûn an kuomah, “Mâni thu in- hriettir lang khawm ka thu inhriettir ân dik a nih; keiin ka hung suokna le ka fena ding chin khawm ka hriet a; nangni chun chu ka hung suokna le ka fena ding chin khawm in hriet si nawh."
Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.,Nangnîn tisa angin in sawisêl hlak; kei ruok chun tukhawm ka sawisêl nawh.
"Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.","Anih, sawisêl lang khawm ka sawisêlna chu indik a tih; keia khât chau ka ni nawh a, kei le Pa a mi tirtu leh kan ni lem leiin."
"Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.","Anih, in Dân Lekhabua khawm, ‘Mi pahni thu ân dik,’ ti ziek a ni bawk annâwm."
"I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.","Kei hi mâni thu inhriettirtu ka nih, Pa a mi tirtu chun ka thu ân hriettir bawk,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I pa khâwlai am?” an tih a.

"These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.","Chuong thu chu Pathien biekinah inchûktir malamin, thaw- lâwm siena hmunah a hril a; tukhawmin ama an man si nawh, a hun a la tlung naw leiin."
"He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ka fe hmang ding a ni hi, nangnîn mi zawng in ta, in suol nei zingin thîng in tih; ka fena dingah hung thei naw ti niu,” a ti nâwk a."
"The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?","Chun, Judahaiin, “ ‘Ka fena dingah hung thei naw ti niu,’ a ti hi ân sukhlum ding am a nih?” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni hnuoi tienga inthawka suok in nih, kei chu chung tienga suok ka nih; nangni hi khawvêla suok in nih, kei chu hi khawvêla suok ka ni nawh."
"I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.","Chuleiin, in kuomah, ‘In suol nei zingin thîng in tih,’ ka ti kha; ama chu ka nih ti in awi naw chun, in suol nei zingin thi mawl in tih,” a ta."
"They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Tû am i ni leh?” an tih a. Isûn an kuomah, “A tira inthawkin in kuomah ka hril hlak kha."
"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.","Nangni chungchâng thua hin thil tamtak hril ding le ngaituo ding ka nei; ieng khawm ni raw se, a mi tirtu chu mi indiktak a nih; a kuoma inthawka thu ka hriet taphawt khawvêl kuomah ka hril hi,” a ta."
They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.,Pa thu an kuomah a hril ti an hriet nawh.
"Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.","Chuongchun, Isu bawkin, “Nangnîn Mihriem Naupa hi in khai kâng hnungin, ama chu ka ni le, kei mâni thuin thil iengkhawm ka thaw nawh a, Pain a mi hril ang peiin hieng thu hi ka hril a nih ti la hung hrieng in tih."

"As he spake these things, many believed on him.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin mi tamtakin ama chu an ring tah a."
"Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples;","Chuongchun, Isûn a ringtu Judahai kuoma chun, “Ka thua in um zing chun, ka inchûktirhai ni taktak in tih;"

"The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?","Chuongchun, a vênghai le inhmaa a kutdaw hmu hlakhai chun, “Hi mipa hi ṭhung puma kut daw hlak kha a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
"Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.","Ṭhenkhatin, “Ama kha a ni hi,” an ta. Mi dangin, “A ni nawh ie, ân angpui a ni lem hi,” an ta. Ama chun, “Kha kha ka nih,” a ta."
"They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I mit iengtin am a hung var leh?” an ta."
"He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.","Ama chun, “Isu an ti khan pilpawk a siem a, ka mitah a nâl a, ‘Siloam dîlah va sâwp rawh,’ a mi tih a. Chuongchun, ka va feh a, ka sâwp a, mitvarna ka hmu tah a ni hi,” a ta."
"And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Ama chu khâwlai am a um a?” an ta. Ama chun, “Ka hriet nawh,” a ta."
They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.,"Chun, chu hmaa mit indel chu Pharisaihai kuomah an ṭhuoi a."
"Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.","Chun, Isûn pilpawk a siem a, a mit a sukvar ni kha châwlni a na."
"Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihaiin mitvarna a hmu dân an indawn nâwk a. Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka mitah pilpawk a sieh a, ka sâwp a, ka hmu thei el a nih,” a ta."
"Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.","Chun, Pharisai ṭhenkhatin, “Chu mipa chu châwlni a hlutsak naw leiin Pathien kuoma inthawka suok ni naw ni,” an ta. Ṭhenkhat ruok chun, “Mi suolin iengtin am hieng ang thilmak thaw thei a ta?” an ta. An inṭheh a, an inkhing tah a."
"They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.","Chun, mitdel kuoma chun, “I mit a sukvar kha nang ieng angin am i ngai a?” an ti nâwk a. Ama chun, “Zâwlnei a nih,” a ta."
"The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin mit- varna hmutu nu le pa chu an ko hmakhat chu mitdel a na, mitvarna a hmu ti, a chungchâng thu chu an awi nawh a."
"and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?","Chun, a nu le pa kuoma chun, “Hi mipa hi in naupa, mitdel saa pieng a nih in ti kha a ni am a nih? Iengtin am tuhin a hmu thei ta a?” tiin an indawn a."
"His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:","A nu le pa chun, “Hi mipa hi kan naupa a nih ti kan hriet, mitdel sain a pieng ti khawm kan hriet,"
"but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.","nisienlakhawm, iengtin am tuhin a hung hmu thei tah a na kan hriet nawh, a mit sukvartu khawm kan hriet bawk nawh; ama indawn ro; patling a nih annâwm, ama thu chu ama bawkin hril raw se,” an ta, an dawn a."
"These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.","Judahai an ṭi leiin a nu le pa chun chuong thu chu an hril a nih; Judahaiin, chu hma khawm chun tûkhawmin “Ama chu Krista a nih,” tia an ṭan chun, inkhâwmna inah hnawng an tih ti hi an remti sa a na."
"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.","Chuleichun a nih, a nu le pa chun, “Patling a nih annâwm, ama indawn ro,” an ti chu."
"So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.","Chuongchun, mitdel chu an ko nâwk a, a kuomah, “Pathien inpâk rawh, ama kha chu mi suol a nih ti kan hriet,” an ta."
"He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.","Ama chun, “Mi suol a ni le ni naw ka hriet nawh, kawng khat ka hriet, kha hma khan ka mit ân del a, tuhin ka hmu thei ta hi,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I chungah iengtin am a thawh a? I mit iengtin am a sukvar a?” an ta."
"He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nakie khan ka hril ta cheu kha, in hriet nuom si nawh; iengdinga in hriet nuom nâwk ta am a ni leh? Nangni khawm ama inchûktirhai ni in nuom ve am a nih?” tiin a dawn a."
"And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.","Chun, anni chun an hal a, “Nang hi ama inchûktir i na, keini chu Mosie inchûktirhai kan ni hi teh."
"We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.","Pathienin Mosie a biek ti kan hriet, hi mipa hrep hi khâwlaia inthawka hung suok am a na, kan hriet hrep nawh,” an ta."
"The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Chu chu a nih a makna chu, khâwlaia inthawka hung suok am a ni in hriet nawh a, ka mit a sukvar tlat si hi."
"We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.","Pathienin mi suol thu a ngai ngai nawh ti ei hriet; nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin Pathien a ngaisak a, a dit zâwng a thaw chun, Pathienin ama chu a thu a ngai hlak."
Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.,Khawvêl insieng tira inthawk tukhawmin mitdel saa pieng mit an sukvar nâwk ti an hriet ngai nawh.
"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.","Hi mipa hi Pathien kuoma inthawka suok a ni naw chun, iengkhawm thaw thei naw ni,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Nang suol letdêra pieng i nih annâwm, nangin i mi hril vei maw?” an ta, an dawn a. Chuongchun, ama chu an hnawt dawk tah a."
"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?","Chun, an hnawt dawk ti Isûn a lo hriet a; chun, a zawng dawk a, “Pathien Naupa i ring am?” a ta."
"He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?","Ama chun, “Pu, ama chu tu am a na, mi hril rawh, ka ring theina dingin?” a ta, a dawn a."
"Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.","Isûn a kuomah, “Ama chu i hmu zing tah, a be zingtu che hi a nih,” a ta."
"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.","Ama chun, “Lalpa, ka ring ie,” a ta, chibai a bûk a."
"And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.","Chun, Isûn, “Rorêl dinga hi khawvêla hin hung ka nih, mitdelhai chu an mit a hung varna ding le, mitvarhai chu an mit a hung indelna dingin,” a ta."
"Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?","Chun, a kâwla Pharisai umhai chun chuong thu chu an hriet a, a kuomah, “Keini khawm hi mitdel kan ni ve am a nih?” an ta."
"Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.","Isûn an kuomah, “Mitdel in ni chun suol nei naw ti niu a, nisienlakhawm, ‘Kan hmu thei ie,’ tuhin in ti sih a, chuleiin, in suol a um zing a nih."
