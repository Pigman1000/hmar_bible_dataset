"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:","Paula, Pathien ditzâwnga Krista Isu tirko le ei unaupa Timothe chun: Korintha Pathien kohran um- hai kuomah, Akaia rama mi inthieng um po pohai kuoma leh:"
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa, lunginsietnahai Pa le thlamuong- na po po Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se."
"who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.","Pathienin keini a mi thlamuonna ngeiin, rinum ieng anga umhai khawm chu kan thlamuon ve theina dingin, ama chun kan rinumna po poah a mi thlamuon hlak."
"For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.",Krista tuornahai chu kan chungah a sipliem angtakin kan thla- muongna hi Krista zârah a sipliem a nih.
"But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:","Nisienlakhawm, rinuma kan um leh nangnirawi thlamuongna ding le sandamna ding a na, thlamuonga kan um leh nangni thlamuong vena ding a nih; chu chun ka rinum tuor bawk hi seltaka in tuornaa chun a thaw hlak a nih."
"and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.","Chun, rinumna chang vehai in ni angin, thlamuongna chang vehai in ni bawk ti kan hrietin, kan beisei pêkna cheu hi a det a nih."
"For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:","Unauhai, Asia rama kan chunga rinumna tlung thu kha in hriet naw kan nuom nawh a, khânga nasataka tuor zo ruol loa, dam hrim khawm beisei lo khawp hiela deldea kan um kha."
"yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:","Anih, keinia chun thi chau hmabâk tah angah kan inhriet a, chu chu mâni inring loa Pathien, mithi keithotu chu, kan ring lemna ding a lo nih."
"who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;","Ama chun chuong ang lâwma thina nasaa inthawk chun a mi lo sansuok tah a, mi la sansuok nâwk a tih. Mi la sansuok nâwk pei a tih ti amaa chun beiseina kan innghat a,"
"ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.",ṭawngṭaina tamtak dawnnaa malsâwmna kan dawnghai leiin mi tamtakin kan aia lâwmthu hrilna an nei theina dingin nangni khawma ṭawngṭainain mi ṭhangruolpui tlat ro.
"For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.","Kan isuong chu hi hi a nih: kan sie le ṭha hrietna thu inhriettir chu, inthiengna le Pathien indikna neiin, tisa varnaah ni loin, Pathien lungin- sietna lemin, khawvêla hin kan châng kha, nangni tiengah kan châng ṭha nâwk zuol a."
"For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:","In tiem hlak a, a awi khawm in iawi bawk hlak naw kha chu, in kuomah thu dang iengkhawm kan ziek nawh a, a tâwp chenin kan thu in awi kan beisei bawk a nih."
"as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.",Ei Lalpa Isu nia chun nangni kan isuonghai in ni ding a nih ti nangni mi ṭhenkhatin in mi awipêk ta ang khan.
"And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;","Chun, chu ringna chu neiin, lunginsietna lêt hni in hmu theina dingin in kuomah hung hmasa lang ka tih a,"
"and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judæa.","nangni sir malamin Makedonia ramah fe pei lang, Makedonia rama inthawkin nangni kuoma hung lêt nâwk dingin. Chun, Judai rama ka fena dinga chun nangni mîn thlain um lang ka ti bawk a."
"When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?","Chuongchun, chuong ang ka lungril lai khan kan lungril det nawzie inentir am ka nih? Annawleh, ka kuomah, “A nih, a nih,” ti le, “A ni nawh, a ni nawh,” ti chu um ve ve dingin, thil thaw ka tum hlak chu tisa angin am a ni ka tum?"
"But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.","Iengkhawm ni raw se, Pathien a ringum angin, nangni tienga ka thu hi “A nih” ti le, “A ni nawh,” ti a ni ve ve si nawh."
"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.","Pathien Naupa Isu Krista, a thu kei le Silvan le Timothein kan ihril kha, “A nih” le “A ni nawh,” a ni ve ve si nawh a; amaa chun, “A nih,” ti a um lem a nih."
"For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.","Pathien thutiem chu iengzât khawm ni sien la, amaa chun, “A nih,” ti chu a um sih a. Chuongchun, ama lei khawmin, “Amen,” ti chu a um a nih, keinihai leia Pathien ropuina dingin."
"Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;","Chun, Kristaa nangni le a mi sukdettu le hriek mi nâltu chu Pathien a nih;"
"who also sealed us, and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.",ama chu a mîn chiktu le ei lungrila zakhamna thlarau mi petu a ni bawk a.
"But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thlarau chunga hretu dingin Pathien ka ko a nih, nangni hla ding cheuin a nih Korinth khuoa ka hung ta naw."
"Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.","In ringna chungah inlalna ka nei ka ti nawh a, in lâwmna ṭhangpuitu ka nih, ka ti lem a nih, ringnaa ngîr in ni sih a."
"Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:","Chun, kei Paula, nangni laia in mithmua thuhnuoirawltaka um a, nangni laia umnaw phingleh nangni tieng zuom si hlak ngei hin, Krista zaidamna le nunnêmnain ka ngên cheu."
"yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.","Anih, in kuomah ka um pha, ṭhenkhat, tisa anga uma mi ruottuhai chunga huoitaka um ka tum ngamna ang hin, ka zuom nawna ding cheuin ka ngên cheu."
"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh","Tisaa, um inlang khawm tisa indo angin kan indo nawh a,"
"(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds);","(keini râldo inthuomna chu tisaah a ni si nawh a, kulpui dettak- hai ṭhiekna dinga Pathien zâra thil thaw thei tak a ni lem),"
"casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;","insêlnahai le thil insâng tinrêng Pathien hrietna hluotu dinga insângtaka siemhai chu ṭhiekin, ngaituona tinrêng Krista thuawina salah kan ṭhuoi a,"
"and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.",in thu awizie a famkim pha chun thuawi nawna po po phuba la dingin kan inzo bawk a.
"Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.","In mithmua thil umhai chu a nih in en hlak chu. Tûkhawmin Krista ta nia ân ring chun, hi hi mâkhâtin ngaituo nâwk raw se; ama chu Krista ta a ni ang bawkin keini khawm kan ni ve hi."
"For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:","Kan thuneina (Nangni ṭhiekna ding ni loa nangni siem ṭhatna dinga Lalpain a mi pêk hi), suong nasa nâwk zuol lang khawm ka muolpho âwm si nawh a,"
that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.,ka lekhathawnhai chun sukṭit cheu tum anga kân lang nawna dingin chu chu ka ti a nih.
"For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.","“A lekhathawnhai chu a rikin a ngar a, a taksa tieng ruok chu a âwmnêm a, a ṭawng khawm insit a um a nih,” an ti sih a."
"Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.","Chuong ang mi chun hi hi ngaituo raw se, in kuoma kan um naw laia lekhathawna thua kan um angin, in kuoma kan um pha khawm thil thawah um bawk kan tih."
"For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.","Ṭhenkhat mâni le mâni inhril- mawihai laia chun kan intiem sa ngam nawh a, anni leh hril khawm kan inhrilkhi ngam bawk nawh; amiruokchu, anni chu mâni le mâni inkhiin, mâni le mâni inhrilkhiin lungril nei loin an um a."
"But we will not glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.","Keini ruok chu kan inkhîna bâka chun uong naw ning ungah. Pathienin biel a mîn changtir a, chu inkhîna ang pei chun uong lem kan tih, nangni chen khawm hung biel rau dinga inkhîna chu."
"For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:",Biel phâk naw sa biel cheu angin kan huop lien taluo si nawh a; Krista Chanchin Ṭha hrilin in khuo chen khawma kan hung kha;
"not glorying beyond our measure, that is, in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto further abundance,","kan inkhina huntâwk liema, mi dang thaw sâwlhai chu, kan suong nawh a, in ringna ân ṭhang ang peiin, kan biel chin ang peiah, nangni lai nasataka suklienin um kan tih ti beiseina kan nei lem a,"
"so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.","buotsai sa kawng thua chun mi dang biel suong loin, in khêl tieng ram chen khawma Chanchin Ṭha kan hril theina dingin."
"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.","Nisienlakhawm, “A suong ta- phawt chun Lalpa chu suong raw se.”"
"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.","Mâni inhrilmawi chun inpâk a hlaw si nawh a, Lalpain a hrilmawi chun inpâk a hlaw lem hlak."
Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.,"Kân vêt deunaa hin nangnîn in mi daw thei ka va nuom de! Anih, daw khawm in mi daw thei ngei a."
"For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.","Pathien thîknain a nih in sawnnaw ka thîk cheu chu; Krista kuoma chun nunghâk inthieng anga ka pêk theina ding cheuin, pasal pakhat ka huol pêk si cheu a."
"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, rûl chun a zâwrnain Evi a hlêm ang khan Krista tienga takna le inthiengnaa inthawk chu ieng amanih tiin in lungril chu sukkhawhlo rawi an tih ti kân lau a nih."
"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him.","Mi dang hungin Isu dang, a thu kan ihril ngai naw a hril a, thlarau danglam in la dawng ngai naw in dawngin, chanchin ṭha dang in ilâwm ngai naw chu in lâwmin in ngaithei pei el a ni maw?"
For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.,Chu tirko lien takhai chu ieng kawnga khawm ka tluk naw ka ring naw a nih.
"But though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made this manifest unto you in all things.",Thu hrila chu ṭawng hmang thiem naw lang khawm hrietnaa chun chuong chu ka ni nawh a; chu chu iengkima fietakin nangni tieng kan inlangtir kha.
"Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?","Annawleh, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha nangni sêngna um hlek loa ka hril cheu a, dawmsânga in um theina dinga kân sukhnuoi khan ka lo suksuol a ni maw?"
"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you;","Nangni rawng ka bâwl theina dingin an kuoma inthawka hlaw lain, kohran danghai sum ka sukhekpêk a."
"and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.","Chun, in kuoma ka um a, ka tlâksam lai khan tûkhawmin an mîn khâwkpui nawh a; unauhai chu Makedonia rama inthawka an hungin ka tlâksamna chu an mi hung phuhrûkpêk a ni sih a; iengkimah nangni inkhâwkpui lo dingin kân siem kha, khâng ang khan insiem zing ka tih."
"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.",Krista thutak keimaa a um ang hin Akaia ram tienga hi ka suongna hi tûkhawma mi sukbo pêk naw ni hai.
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.,Ieng leiin am? Ka lunginsiet naw lei cheu am a nih? Ka lunginsiet zie cheu chu Pathienin a hriet.
"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.","Nisienlakhawm, remchângna hmu nuomtuhaia inthawka rem- chângna chu ka sâttan theina dingin, ka thaw hlak hi thaw pei ka tih, an suongnaa chun keini um ang hin an hung um theina dingin."
"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.","Mi chuong ang mi chu, Krista tirkoa insiem fâwm, tirko tehlêmhai, sinthawtu mi hlêm hmanghai an ni sih a."
And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.,"Chu chu a mak nawh, Setan meu khawm var tirkoah ân siem fâwm hlak sih a."
It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.,"Chuleiin, a rawngbâwltuhai khawm chu felna tirkoah insiem fâwm hai sien khawm a mak a ni nawh, chuonghai tâwpna chu an thil thaw ang pei nîng a tih."
"I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if ye do, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.","Hril nâwk hlak ka tih, tûkhawmin invêtah mi ngai naw raw hai se; nisienlakhawm, chuonga in mi ngai si chun, kei khawmin tlâwmtê bêka ka suong ve theina dingin, invêt angin mi daw bawk ro."
"That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.","Ka hril hi Lalpa thu angin ka hril nawh a, ka insuongna ringzona leiin invêt ang takin hril ka ni lem a nih."
"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.",Mi tamtakin tisa anga an suong leiin kei khawmin hang suong vêng ka tih;
"For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves.","nangni chu le, mi var in ni leiin invêthai chu lungawitakin indaw hlak sih a."
"For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you captive, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.","Miin suokah siem sienla cheu, fa zo duok sienla cheu, salah man sienla cheu, ama le ama inchawimawi sienla, in hmaiah ben sienla cheu khawm in daw hlak sih a."
"I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.","Kan lo hrât ta naw angin, insitin ka hril a nih; nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin ieng kawnga khawm an ngam taphawt (invêttakin hang hril ta inla) kei khawmin ka ngam."
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.,Hebrai mi an ni maw? Kei khawm ka nih. Israel mihai an ni maw? Kei khawm ka nih. Abraham suonhai an ni maw? Kei khawm ka nih.
"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.","Krista rawngbâwltuhai an ni maw? (invêt angin hang hril ta inla) ka ni lem hman hman a, sin thaw inrimnaahai nasa nâwk zuolin, intângna ina intângnaahai nasa nâwk zuolin, vuoknaahai inhliek- takin, thinaahai vawi tamtak,"
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.,Judahai lai vuokna vawi khata vawi sâwmli tlingnaw ṭum nga ka tuok a;
"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;","vawi thum hmawla vuokin ka um a, vawi khat lunga dêngin ka um a, vawi thum lawng sietna ka tuok a, zân khat le ni khat tuisuorietah ka um a;"
"in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my countrymen, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;","Inzinna ṭum tamtakhaiah, — vadunga ṭiumnaahai, suomhmang - hai laia ṭiumnaahai, ka chipuihai laia ṭiumnaahai, Jentailhai laia ṭium - naahai, khawpuia ṭiumnaahai, thla - lêra ṭiumnaahai, tuisuorieta ṭium - naahai, unau tehlêmhai laia ṭium - naahai,"
"in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.","sâwlnaa le sininrimnaahai, in- theinawnaahai vawi tamtak, phîng- ṭâm le dangchârnaahai, bungheinaa- hai vawi tamtak, khawsik le saruoka umnaahai dâm ka um hlak."
"Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.","Chun, ka ihril tahai ti tâk loah, kohran po po ka ngaituona, ni tina a mi del zing hi a um bawk a."
"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?",Ka hrâtnawpui loa hrâtnaw tu am a um a? ka lungril sukna loa sukthlûk tu am a um hlak a?
"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.",Suong ding ka ni rau rau chun ka hrât nawna tieng thilhai a nih ka suong lem ding.
"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.","Lalpa Isu Pathien le Pa, kumkhuoa inpâk tlâka um chun khêl ka hril nawzie chu a hriet."
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:,"Damaskaa khan, lal Areta hnuoia rorêltu chun a mi man dingin Damaskaa mihai khawpuia chun ân vêngtir a;"
"and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.","chun, tukvera, kul hrûla chun bâwma thlâkin ka um a, chuongchun, a kuta inthawkin kân relhmang sawng tah a."
"I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.","Ka suong hrim hrim ding a nih, ṭhat chu a ṭha nawh a, nisienlakhawm, Lalpa kuoma in- thawka inlârna le inhriettirna thu hril kai pei el ka tih."
"I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.","Kristaa mi pakhat ka hriet, ama chu kum sâwm le pali a ni tah a, (taksain amanih a um ka hriet nawh, taksa loin amanih a um ka hriet bawk nawh a, Pathienin a hriet) vân thumna meua khin zuk lâkin a um a."
"And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),","Chun, chu ama ngei chu (taksain amanih a um, taksa loin amanih a um ka hriet nawh, Pathienin a hriet)."
"how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.","Paradisa lâka a um le, thu hril thei ruol lo mihriem hril thiengnawhai dâm chu a hriet ti ka hriet."
"On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses.","Mi chuong ang chu suong ka tih; nisienlakhawm, ka hrâtnawna ti lo chu mâni chu insuong naw ning ah."
"For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.","Suong nuom lang khawm invêt ni naw ning a, thu taktak ka hril ding a ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, insûm ka tih; chuong naw chun, tûkhawmin an mi hmu ang le, keia inthawka thu an hriet ang nêkin mi ngai ropui lem rawi an tih."
"And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.","Chun, inhriettirnahai chu a nasa bêk bêk leia kân ngaihlu taluo nawna dingin tisaah hling a mi pêk a nih. Setan tirko, kut inthak nûlnaa mi hmangtu ding chu; chuong naw chun, inngaihlu taluo rawi ka tih."
"Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.","Chu chungchâng thua chun, a mîn kiengsan theina dingin Lalpa chu vawi thum ka hnih a."
"And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Ka lunginsietna i ta dingin a hun deh, ka thilthawtheina hi hrâtnawnaah i sawnnaw sukfamkima a um,” a ti tah a. Chuongchun, Krista thilthawthei- na chu ka chunga a um theina dingin, lâwmtakin ka hrâtnawnahai hi suong lem tâng ka tih."
"Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.","Chuleiin, Krista leiin hrâtnaw- naahai, sietnaahai, hnengdenaahai, suknawmnatnaahai, hnawchêpnaa- hai, ka lâwm hlak a nih; ka hrât naw po leh ka hrât hlak a nih."
"I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.","Ka lo invêt a ni ta tie: nangniin invêt lo thei loin in mi siem a nih; kei chu nangni mi chawimawi ding ka nih in sawnnaw, iengkhawm ni naw lang khawm ieng kawnga khawm tirko lientakhai chu ka tluk naw si nawh a."
"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.","Tirko ni inchikna chu selna tinrêng neiin, inchiknahai, thilmak- hai, thilthawtheinahaiin in kuoma thaw a ni tak tak kha."
"For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.","Ieng kawng am a na, kohran danghai nêka inhnuoi lema siema in umna chu? Keima ngeiin ka sukkhâwk nawna cheu kawnga khan a ni nghâl naw chun. Chu indik nawnaa chun mi ngaidam ro."
"Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.","Ngai ta u, hi hi in kuoma hung dinga kân zo a vawi thumna ding a nih; chun, mîn khâwkpui naw ti niua, in ta chu zawng ka ni si nawh a, nangni a nih ka zawng lem cheu chu; nauhaiin nu le pa ta dingin an inkhâwl pêk ding a ni nawh a, nu le pahaiin nauhai ta dingin an inkhâwl pêk lem ding a ni sih a."
"And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?","Kei chu ka nei po po in thlarau ta dingin lâwm takin hmang zo ka ta, kei ngei khawm inhmang zo vawng bawk ka tih. Chuong lâwma ka hmangai si cheu chun in mi hmangai tlâwm lem bîk el ding maw?"
"But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.","Amiruokchu, kei chu in mîn khâwkpui naw ni ta phawt sienla; nisienlakhawm, mi vervêk hrim hrim lo niin, zâwrin ka man cheu a lo ni hi!"
Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?,In kuoma ka itirhai lai khan tû amani bêk hmangin ka hlâwk pha cheu am a nih?
"I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?","Tita chu kân fui a, unaupa chu ama ruolin ka tir a nih. Tita chun hlâwk phâna hrim hrim a nei cheu am a nih? Lungril hmunkhat puta lêng kan ni naw am a nih? Hnung thuhmun chara lêng kan ni naw am a nih?"
"Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.","Tuta sûng po hin nangni kuomah kan thiemna thu hrilah in mi ring zing a ni âwm a. Kristaa chun Pathien mithmuah a nih thu kan hril chu. Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, ieng- kim hi nangni siem ṭhatna ding a nih."
"For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;","Ka hung phaa ieng amani tiin ka dit angin hung hmu naw rawi ka ti cheu a, kei khawm in dit angin mi hmu naw rawi in tih, ti le, ieng amani tiin, inhalnahai, inthîknahai, lung- sennahai, inkhingnahai, inrêlnahai, inberua thu lâknahai, inngaihlut taluotnahai, buoinahai hung um rawi a tih ti le;"
"lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.","ka hung nâwk pha ka Pathienin nangni lai mi sukmuolpho nâwkin, kha hmaa thil suksuoltuhai lai thil inthiengnaw thaw dâm, indit dâm, hur dâm, chînga sim si lo mi tamtakhai chu ṭa rawi ka tih, ti kân lau in sawnnaw."
This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word be established.,"Hi hi in kuoma ka hung a vawi thumna ding a nih. Hretuhai pahni amanih, pathum amani baua chun thu tinrêng sukdetin um a tih."
"I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;","Ka hril lâwk tah a, vawi hninaa in kuoma ka um laia ka hril ang khan, tuhin in kuomah um naw lang khawm, kha hmaa thil suksuoltuhai kuoma le mi po po kuomah hril lâwk nâwk ka tih. “Ka hung nâwk chun hla naw ning ah,” ti hi."
"seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:","Krista keimaa thu hril hlaktu chu fiena in zawng leiin, ama chu nangni tieng a hrâtnaw nawh a, thil thawtheitak a ni lem a nih."
"for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.","Ama chu hrâtnawnaa hemdein a um a, nisienlakhawm, Pathien thilthawtheina leiin a hring ta zing a nih. Keini khawm amaa chun kan hrâtnaw a nih; nisienlakhawm, nangni tienga Pathien thilthaw- theina leiin a kuomah hring vêng kan tih."
"Try your own selves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate.","Ringnaa chun in um am, nangni insin hlak unla, nangni ngei infie hlak ro. Annawleh, nangniah Isu Krista chu a um ti nangni ngeiin in hriet chieng naw am a nih? dit naw in ni nghâl naw chun."
But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.,Keini ruok chu dit loin kan um nawh ti la hung hre dingin ka ring cheu.
"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.","Chun, thil hrim hrim in suksuol nawna dingin Pathien kuomah kan hni hlak a, chu chu keini hi dituma kan inlang theina ding a ni nawh a, nangniin a mawi mawi in thaw theina dingin a ni lem; keini chu dit naw angin um inlang khawm."
"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.","Thutak ṭan ding naw chun, thutak do ding chun iengkhawm kan thaw thei naw a nih."
"For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.","Keini kan hrâtnaw lai khawma nangni in hrât hin kan lâwm hlak in sawnnaw; hi hi kan hni bawk hlak, nangni ṭhat famkimna ding hi."
"For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.","Chuleiin, sukse ding ni loa, siem ṭha ding lema Lalpain thuneina a mi pêk ang pei khan, in kuoma ka um pha nataka ka kâwk nawna ding cheuin in kuoma ka um naw lai hin hieng thu hi ka ziek a nih."
"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.","A tâwp taka chun, unauhai, lâwmtakin um ro. Sukṭhat famkim- in um unla, lungmuongtakin um unla, lungril hmunkhat put unla, lunginruoltakin um ro; chuong- chun, hmangaina le inremna Pathien chu in kuomah a um ding a nih."
Salute one another with a holy kiss.,Fâwp inthiengin chibai inbûk ro.
All the saints salute you.,Mi inthienghai po poin chibai an bûk cheu.
"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.","Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna dâm, Pathien hmangaina dâm, Thlarau Inthieng pâwlna dâm chu in rênga kuomah um raw se."
"But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.","Nisienlakhawm, keia tieng thua chun hi hi ka lo tum tlat a nih, lungngai pum chun in kuoma hung ta lo dingin."
"For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?",Keiin ka suklungngai si cheu chun ka isuklungngai bawk naw chu tû am a mi suklâwmtu nîng a ta?
"And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.","Chuleichun, kha ngei kha ka ziek a nih; chuong naw chun ka hung pha ka lâwmna dinghai laia inthawkin lungngaina hmu rawi ka tih; ka lâwmna chu in rênga in lâwmna a ni ka ring pêk si cheu a."
"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.","Mitthli tamtak tla pumin, lungril rinum le thlaphângtaka ka ziek a ni kha; chu chu suklungngaia in umna ding a ni nawh a, in chunga hmangaina nasa nâwk zuol ka nei hi in hriet theina lem dingin a nih."
"But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin mi- hai a suklungngai chun, keima chau a mi suklungngai a ni nawh a; uortaka ti cheu khawm ni loin in rêngin a suklungngai met seng cheu a nih."
Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;,Chuong ang mi chu mi tam lemin in hrem chu a hun.
"so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.","Chuongchun, hrem nâwkzuol nêk hmanin in ngaidamin, in thla- muon lem ding a nih; chuong naw chun, iengamanih tiin chuong ang mi chu lungngai taluotnain lem zo rawi a tih."
Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.,"Chuleichun, ama tienga in hmangaina chu sukdet zuol dingin ka ngên cheu a nih."
"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.",Hi lei khawm hin ka ziek a nih: kawng tinrêngah thu in awi le in awinaw kân fie theina ding cheuin.
"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the presence of Christ;","Ieng kawnga khawm mi in ngaidam taphawt chu, kei khawmin ka ngaidam veh a; kei khawma ka ngaidam tasa chu, iengkhawm ka ngaidam ta chun, nangni leiin Krista hmaa chun ka ngaidam tah a nih;"
that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.,"chuong naw chun, Setanin mi tlâkkhal rawi a tih, a zâwrna chu ei inhmei si nawh a."
"Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,","Chun, Krista Chanchin Ṭha hril dinga Troas ka tlung lai khan, Lalpaa chun lampui an mi hawngpêk nâka chu,"
"I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.","ka unaupa Tita ka hmu naw leiin ka thlarau tieng chun muongna hrim hrim ka nei chuong nawh a; chuongchun, anni chu bau ṭhain ka ṭheh a, Makedonia ramah ka fe tah a."
"But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.","Nisienlakhawm, Kristaa hnê- naa mi ṭhuoi rawptu le keini hmanga hmun tina ama hrietna rim inhriet- tirtu Pathien kuoma chun lâwmthu um raw se."
"For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;","Sandam mêkhaia le, bohmang mêkhaia chun, Pathien ta dingin Krista rim inhnik kan ni sih a,"
to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?,"pâwl khathai ta ding chun, thinaa inthawka thina ding rim kan lo ni a, pâwl danghai ta ding chun, hringnaa inthawka hringna ding rim kan lo nih."
"For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.","Chuong ang ding chun tu am tling zo an ta? Mi tamtakin Pathien thu hi mihai hlêma sumdâwngnaa an hmang angin, keini chun kan hmang ve si nawh a, titakzet lemin, Pathien itir lemin, Pathien mithmuin Kristaa chun thu kan hril lem hlak a nih."
"Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?","Mâni inhrilmawi ei phut nâwk ding a ni ta maw? Annawleh, in kuoma pêk ding amanih, in kuoma inthawk amanih hrilmawina lekha, mi ṭhenkhat ta dinga a ngai angin, kan ta dingin a ngai ve ding a ni maw?"
"Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;","Nangni hi kan lekha, kan lungrila ziek, mi po po ihriet le tiem chu in nih,"
"being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.","Krista lekha, keini a mîn ziektir, lekhatuia ziek nilo, Pathien hring Thlaraua ziek lem, lung phêka ziek niloa, tisa lung phêka ziek lem chu in nih, ti chiengtaka inlangtir a ni sih a."
And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:,"Chun, Pathien tienga chuong ang ringna chu Krista zârah kan nei a nih;"
"not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;",iengkhawm keinia inthawka suoka ruot dingin keini ngawtin kan tlin kan ti nawh a; kan tlin theina chu Pathien kuoma inthawk a ni lem.
"who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.","Ama bawk chun thuthlung thar rawngbâwltuahai a mîn tlin tir a; lekha thu ela rawngbâwltuahai ni loin, Thlarau rawngbâwltuahai a ni lem; lekha thu ngawt chun a sukhlum hlak sih a. Thlarau ruok chun a sukhring hlak a nih."
"But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which glory was passing away:","Mosie hmêl a ropui leiin Israel nauhai chun a hmêl an en zing thei nawh a. (chu ropuina chu a bo ta riei riei a), thina rawngbâwlna lunga hawrawpa ziek hman, chuong ang khawpa ropuiin a tlung chun,"
how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?,Thlarau rawngbâwlna chu ieng ang taka ropuiin am a tlung ding chu?
"For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.","Thiemnaw inchangtirna rawng- bâwlna hman a ropui chun, felna rawngbâwlna chu ropuina tieng chun a nasa lem bêk bêk ding a nih."
"For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.","Sukropuia um ta chun, hi tieng panga hin ropuina hrim a nei si nawh a; ropuina nasa chun a khûm leiin."
"For if that which passeth away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in glory.","Bo riei riei ta hman chu ropuia a tlung chun, um zing ding chu ropuia tuomin a um lem bêk bêk ding a nih."
"Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,","Chuongchun, chuong ang bei- seina chu kan nei leiin iengkim kan hril suok hlak a nih;"
"and are not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:","Mosie thaw ang khan kan thaw ve nawh, ama chun bo ta riei riei bo tâwpna chu Israel nauhaiin an en zing nawna dingin a hmai chu hmai inkhumnain ân khum a."
"but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed to them that it is done away in Christ.",An lungril ruok chu sukngarin a um ta lem a; vawisûn chen khawm hin thuthlung hlui chu an tiemin inkhumna pângngai chu hlîm loin a um zing sih a; chu inkhumna chu Kristaa chun sukboin a um tah a.
"But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.","Nisienlakhawm, vawisûn chen hin Mosie Lekhabu an tiem po leh an lungrila chun inkhumna chu a um hlak."
"But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.","Nisienlakhawm, an lungril Lalpa tienga an nghat tik tik inkhum- na chu lâkhmang ni tâng a tih."
"Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.","Chun, Lalpa chu Thlarau chu a na, Lalpa Thlarau umna taphawta chun zalênna a um hlak."
"But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.","Chuongchun, keini chu kan rêngin hmai inkhum loin, hlimen anga Lalpa ropuina sunvarin, ropui- naa inthawka ropui peiin, chu angpui ngeia um dingin, sukdanglamin kan um hlak, Lalpaa (Thlaraua) inthawk- a kan hmu ang peiin."
"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:","Chuleichun, lunginsietna kan hmu ang peia hi rawngbâwlna hi kan nei leiin kan dawl nawh a;"
"but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.","thil inzâpuium inthuphai chu kan mâk ta lem a; zâwrna thu kan hmang nawh a, Pathien thu mi hlêmnain kan hmang bawk nawh a; thutak inhriettirin Pathien mit- hmuin mi tin sie le ṭha hrietna mit kan intlungtir lem hlak a nih."
"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:","Nisienlakhawm, kan Chanchin Ṭha hi inkhuma a um chun bohmang mêkhaia hin a nih inkhuma a um chu."
"in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn upon them.","Krista Pathien angpui, a ropuizie Chanchin Ṭha var chun anni a sunvar thei nawna dingin chuongahai chun khawvêl pathienin awinawhai mit a sukdel tah a."
"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.","Mâni thu kan hril si nawh a, Krista Isu chu Lalpa a ni kan hril lem hlak, keini khawm Isu leiin suok kan ni kan hril bawk hlak."
"Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.","Isu Krista hmêla chun, Pathien ropuizie hrietna var chu mi pe dingin, “Inthima inthawkin var varsuok a tih,” titu Pathien chun kan lungrilhai hi a sunvar ta sih a."
"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;","Nisienlakhawm, thilthawtheina nasatzie chu keini kuoma inthawk ni loin, Pathien ta a ni thei lemna dingin, chu ro chu pil bêlahai kan kawl a nih."
"we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;","Khing tieng khing tienga hneng- dein kan um a, nisienlakhawm, kan thuok a dawng si nawh; lunginzîngin kan um a, nisienlakhawm, kan bei a dawng si nawh."
"pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;","Suknawmnatin kan um a, nisien- lakhawm, mâksanin kan um si nawh; vuok thlûkin kan um a; nisienla- khawm, sukbohmangin kan um si nawh."
"always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.","Kan taksaa hin kumkhuoin Isu thina chu kan put pei hlak a, Isu hringna khawm kan taksaa hin ân lang theina dingin."
"For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.","Keini hringa la umhai hi, Isu leia thi dingin inmantirin kan um rawp a, Isu hringna khawm kan tisa thi theia hin ân lang theina dingin."
"So then death worketh in us, but life in you.","Chuongchun, keinia hin thinain sin a thaw hlak a, nangnia ruok chu hringnain sin a thaw hlak a nih."
"But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;","Amiruokchu, “Ka awia, chuleiin thu ka hril a nih,” ti ziek ang khan, chu ringna lungril ngai chu putin, keini khawmin kan awi ve a, chuleiin thu kan hril bawk a;"
"knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.",Lalpa Isu keithotu chun keini khawm Isu kuomah a mi keitho ve ding a na; nangni leh a mîn ngîrtir ding a nih ti kan hriet sih a.
"For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.","Iengkim nangni ṭhatna ding a ni sih a, lunginsietna chu mi tam lem zâra sukpunga umin, Pathien ropui- na dinga lâwmthu nasatak ân hriltir theina dingin."
"Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.","Chuleichun, kan dawl nawh a, kan puotieng mihriem hi hung awngrawp tieu tieu sien khawm kan sûng tieng mihriem chu ni tin siem thar peiin a um lem a nih."
"For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;","Kan rinum nêptak, hi mit inkhap kâr chaua um ding hin ropuina nasatak, kumkhuoa dingin a mi siem pêk nasa deu deu a nih;"
"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.","thil hmuthei hi en loin, thil hmutheinawhai chu kan en lem sih a; thil hmutheihai hi sâwtnawtêa ding a na, thil hmutheinawhai ruok chu kumkhuoa ding a ni sih a."
"For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.","Ei umna hnuoia in hi ṭiek sien khawm, vânah, in kuta bawl lo, kumkhuoa um zing ding, Pathien kuoma in nghet chu ei nei ti ei hriet sih a."
"For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:","Vâna ei umna ding sil thuo inhâwk bêk bêkin hi ina hin ei inrûm tak meu hlak sih a; chuong anga silin um inla, saruokin um nâwng ei tih."
if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.,Eini hi umnaa umhai hi rik phurin ei inrûm takzet sih a;
"For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.","sil loa um ei nuom lei a ni nawh a, sil thuoa um ei nuom lei a nih, thithei hi hringna ilem zoa a um theina dingin."
"Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.","Chun, chu thil ngei dinga a mibuotsaitu chu Pathien a nih, zakhamna Thlarau mi petu kha."
"Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord","Chuongchun, taksaa ei um sûngin, Lalpa kuomah ei um nawh ti hrein kumkhuoin muongtakin ei um hlak;"
"(for we walk by faith, not by sight);","(hmutheia fe loin, ringnain ei fe lem sih a);"
"we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.","muongtakin ei um ka ti a nih, taksaa um loa Lalpa kuoma um ei nuom lem."
"Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.","Chuleiin, um inla um naw inla khawm, ama lâwm zâwng ni ei tum tlat hlak a nih."
"For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.","Mi tinin taksaa ei thilthawhai a sie a ṭhaa ei thaw ang peia ei hmu seng theina dingin, Krista rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaa chun suklangin ei um vawng ding a ni sih a."
"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.","Chuongchun, Lalpa ṭina châng hrein, mihriemhai chu kan thlêm hlak a, Pathien kuoma ruok chun inlangtirin kan um a; nangni sie le ṭha hrietnaa khawm inlangtira kan um ka beisei."
"We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.","In kuomah kan inhrilmawi nâwk a ni nawh a, lungril tieng ni loa, ân lang el zawngtuhai chu ieng amanih dawnna in nei theina dingin keini tienga suongna san siempêk cheuin kan hril lem a nih."
"For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.","Kan invêt leh Pathien ta ding a na, kan var leh nangni ta ding a ni sih a."
"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;","Krista hmangaina chun keini a mi tirlui a nih, hieng ang hin kan ngaituo; mi po po thi aiin mi pakhat a thih a, chuleiin, mi po po chu an thi a nih."
"and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.","Chun, a hringhai chu anni ta dinga hring ni ta loa, an thi aia thia thonâwk ta ding chun an hring ta lemna dingin a nih, mi po po aia a thi chu."
"Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.","Chuleichun, tuta chena hin, keini chun tisa tienga chun tûkhawm hre ta naw ning ungah; tisa tiengah Krista chu lo hre ta inlang khawm, tuhin chu kan hriet nâwk ta nawh."
"Wherefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.","Chuleichun, tûkhawm Kristaa a um chun thilsiem thar a hung ni tah a; thil hluihai chu a bo tah a, ngai ta u, a hung thar tah."
"But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;","Nisienlakhawm, iengkim Pa- thiena inthawka suok a nih; ama chun Krista leiin ama le inremin a mi siem a, inremna rawngbâwl sin a mi pêk a;"
"to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.","khânga, Pathienin Kristaa chun khawvêl hi ama le inremin a siem a, an bawsietnahai chu baw- sietnaa ruot pêk loin, inremna thu a mîn kawltir kha."
"We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech you on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.","Chuongchun, Krista aia palai kan na, Pathienin keini hmangin a ngên cheu ti thei a nih. “Pathien leh hung inrem ro,” tiin Krista aiin kan ngên cheu a nih."
Him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.,Amaa chun Pathien felna ei hung ni theina dingin suol hrim hrim hre lo chu Pathienin eini leiin suolah a siem a.
And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain,"Chun, Pathien lunginsietna chu ṭhathnempui loa in hmu nawna dingin, ama thawpuiin ka ngên cheu a nih."
"(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succor thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):","“Hun lâwmumah ka ngaithlâk cheh a, Sandamna niah ka ṭhangpui che,” a ti sih a. Ngai ta u, tu hi hun lâwmum chu a na; ngai ta u, tu hi sandamna ni chu a nih."
"giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;",Kan rawngbâwlna sin chu an dem nawna dingin ieng kawnga khawm tlûkphâna ding hrim hrim kan siem nawh a;
"but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,","Pathien rawngbâwltuhai angin iengkimah mi mit tlungin kan um lem hlak, nasataka selnaa dâm; hnawchêpnaa dâm,"

"by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;","sukropuina le sukmuolphonain, hming hril siet le hming hril ṭhatin, hlêmtu angin, mi indiktak ni siin,"
"as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;","mi hriet khawp naw angin, hming inthangtak siin, thi vâng vâng angin, ngai ta u, kan hring sih a; thunun angin sukhluma um si loin;"
"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.","lungngai angin, nisienla- khawm, lâwm rawp siin; pasie angin, nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak sukhausa siin; iengkhawm neilo angin, iengkim hau siin."
"Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.","Aw, Korintha mihai, in kuomah kan bau kan kah a, kan lungril kan hawng lien pêk cheu,"
"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.","keinîn kan lungril kan khârpêk cheu a ni nawh a, nangnîn in mi khârpêk lem a nih."
"Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.","Chuongchun, nauhai kuoma hril ang elin ka hril cheu; nangni tienga lungril kan put ang hi, mîn hmutir ve unla, in lungril hawng lien ve ro."
Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?,"Awinawhai leh inruolnawtaka rîngkawl bât hmunkhatin um naw ro; rîtlona le felnain ieng am inṭawmna an nei a? Annawleh, inthim le varin ieng am inpâwlna an nei a?"
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?,"Belier le Krista khawmin ieng am inngeina an nei a? Annawleh, awinaw le awitu chun ieng am chan hmunkhat an nei a?"
"And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","Milimhai le Pathien biekin khawmin ieng am inremna an nei a? Eini chu Pathien hring biekin ei ni sih a; Pathienin, “Anniah um ka ta, Anniah lêng bawk ka ta; Chun, an Pathien nîng ka ta, Anni khawm ka mihai nîng an tih”, a ti ang khan."
"Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you,","Chuleiin, “Anni laia inthawkin hung suok unla, A tumin um ro, thil inthiengnaw hrim khawm them naw ro, Lalpain a tih,” Chuongchun, “Lâwm ka ti cheu a,"
"And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.","In ta dingin Pa nîng ka ta, Nangni khawm keia ta dingin naunu naupa ning in tih,” Lalpa iengkimthawthei chun a tih."
"Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.","Chuongchun, dittakhai, chuong thutiem chu ei nei leiin, tisa le thlarau inthiengnaw po poah insuk- fai ei tiu, Pathien ṭi puma inthieng- na sukfamkimin."
"Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man.","In lungrilah hmun mîn kien ro; tu chunga khawm kan suksuol ngai nawh a, tûkhawm kan sukkhawhlo nawh a, tûkhawm kan tlâkkhal nawh."
"I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together.","Chu chu thiemnaw inchangtir ding cheuin ka ti a ni nawh a, thi leh thi tlânga, dam leh dam tlâng dingin kan lungrila hin kan invawi cheu ti inhma el khan ka hril cheu kha."
"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.","Nangni tienga chu ka ṭawng ngamzie hi a nasa a, ka suongzie cheu hi a nasa a nih; thlamuongnain ka sip a, kan rinumna po poa chun hlimin ka sip liem a nih."
"For even when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.","Makedonia ram kan tlung khawm khan kan tisa chun muongna hrim a nei chuong nawh a; khing tieng khing tienga sukrinumin kan um ta lem a, puotiengah insuol- nahai a um a, sûngtiengah ṭitnahai a um a."
"Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;","Nisienlakhawm, inngaitlâwmhai thlamuongtu Pathien chun, Tita hungna chun a mi thlamuong tah a;"
"and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.","a hungna chau chun a ni nawh a, in lunginlêngzie dâm, in ṭapzie dâm, ka chunga in ṭhahnemngaizie dâm a mi hrilin, nangnia a thlamuongna khawm chun a mi thlamuong ta a nih; chuongchun, ka lâwm nâwk zuol tah a."
"For though I made you sorry with my epistle, I do not regret it: though I did regret it (for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season),","Ka lekhathawn khan suklung- ngai cheu lang khawm kân sîr ta nawh a; a phut ruok khan chu kân sîr a nih, kha lekhathawn khan a suk- lungngai cheu ti ka hriet leiin; nisienlakhawm, sâwtnawtê chau a ni kha."
"I now rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing.","Tuhin chu ka lâwm a nih, suklungngaia in um lei a ni nawh a, simna dinga in lungngai leiin a ni lem a nih, keia leia iengkhawm in chân nawna dingin, Pathien dit zâwnga suklungngaiin in um sih a."
"For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, a repentance which bringeth no regret: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.","Pathien dit zâwng anga lung- ngaina chun, sandamna dingin, insîrna um ta lo simna chu a siem si hlak a; khawvêl lungngaina ruok chun thina a siem lem hlak."
"For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what longing, yea what zeal, yea what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.","Chuongchun, hi thil hi inchik ro: Pathien dit zâwnga suklung- ngaina chun, thil lâk ursûnna dâm, pawi tâwk ve naw in nih ti inlangtir nuomna dâm, suol theidâna le suol ṭina dâm, chuong ang ngaituona hrât tak le ṭhahnemngaina tak dam, suol thawtu chu thunun dinga inpei zingna dâm, ân neitir cheu a ni hi. Iengkimah chuong thua chun in inthieng tah ti in suklang tah a."
"So although I wrote unto you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God.","Chuongchun, in kuomah ziek lang khawm a suol thawtu lei khan ka ziek nawh a, a suol tuortu lei khan ka ziek bawk nawh a, kan chunga in ṭhahnemngaizie Pathien mithmua in kuoma inhriettira a um theina dingin ka ziek lem a nih."
"Therefore we have been comforted: and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all.","Chuleiin, thlamuongin kan um ta hrim a; keini thlamuongna chau naw khawm, Tita lâwmna leiin kan lâwm nasa nâwk zuol a; nangni po poin a lungril in sukhar pêk ta leiin."
"For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.","A kuomah ieng kawnga khawm nangni suong lang cheu khawm, ka muolpho si nawh a; muolpho nêk hmanin iengkim in kuoma thu taktaka kan hril hlak ang kha, Tita hmaa kan suong chu thu taktak a hung ni ta ngei a."
"And his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.","Chun, in rênga thu in awizie dâm, ṭi le inthin puma ama in lo lâwmzie dâm chu hre zingin a lungril chu nangni tieng nasatakin ân lâwp nâwk zuol a nih."
I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.,Kawng tinrêngah in chunga ka muong leiin ka lâwm a nih.
"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;","Chuongchun, unauhai, Makedo- nia rama kohranhai laia Pathien lunginsietna pêka um chu kan inhriettir ding cheu a nih;"
how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.,khânga rinuma fiena nasatak puma an hlimna a liem le an rimsikna nasatak chu an tiktlaina nasataka ân chang tâkzie kha.
"For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,","An theitâwk ang peiin, anih, an theitâwk nêka nasa lemin anni thu thuin an pêk ti ka hrietpui a nih:"
beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:,lunginsietna mi inthienghai rawngbâwla ṭhang ve chu nasataka keini mi hniin.
"and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.",Chu khawm chu kan ring naw ang takin an thawh a. Pathien dit zâwngin Lalpa kuoma le keini kuomah anni an inpêk hmasa zet zet a nih.
"Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.","Chuongchun, inhmaa an lo thaw ṭan ta lei khan hi lunginsietna khawm hi nangnia thaw zo nghâl dingin Tita chu kan ngên ta rau a."
"But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.","Chuongchun, iengkim–ringna dâm, thu hril thiemna dâm, hrietna dâm, ṭhahnemngaina po po dâm, in mi hmangaina dâm, in hau ang hin, chu lunginsietna khawm chu in hau theina dingin taimâk suo ro."
"I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.","Thupêk tiengin ka hril nawh a, mi dang ṭhahnemngainain in hma- ngaina takzie khawm chu infie dingin ka hril lem a nih."
"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna chu, a rimsik leia in hung hausak theina dingin, hausa sienla khawm nangni lei ngeiin a lo rimsi ta kha in hriet sih a."
"And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.","Chuongchun, chutaka chun ka ngaidân ang a nih ka hril, chu chu in ta dingin a ṭha sih a, kum khat a ni tah a, a phut hmasatuhai in na, in thaw phut chau khawm ni loin a thaw nuom hmasatak khawm in ni kha."
"But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.","Chuongchun, nuom dinga in- zona a um ang khan, in nei ang peia hlenna khawm a um theina dingin, tuhin chu thaw sawng ta ro."
"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he hath not.","Inzona chu a um phawt chun, mi a nei naw sa ni loin, a neizie ang peia a pêk chu lâwm tlâk a ni sih a."
For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed;,"Mi dang inrim loa, nangni in inrimna dinga ka ti a ni nawh a;"
"but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:","inchawkchamna dingin, in nei liem chu tulai hin an tlâksamna phuhrûkna a lo ni thei a, anni nei liem khawm in tlâksamna phuhrûk- na a lo ni ve thung theina dingin ka ti lem a nih; chuongchun, inchawk- chamna hung um thei a tih."
"as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.","“A rût tam chun a chuongin a nei nawh a, a rût tlâwm khawm a tlasam chuong nawh,” tia ziek ang khan."
"But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.","Chun, in chunga ka ṭhahnem- ngaina ang Tita lungrila pe hlaktu Pathien kuoma chun lâwmthu um raw se."
"For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.","Ama chun, kan infuina chu a pawm ngei a, nisienlakhawm, kan infui lei chau ni loin, ama ngei khawm chu ṭhahnemngai tak a na, ama thu thuin in kuoma hung dingin a suok ta a nih."
And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches;,"Chun, ama ruolin unaupa kan tir ve ta bawk a, ama chu Chanchin Ṭha kawnga an inpâk thu kohranhai po poah ân thang suok a."
"and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness:","Chuong chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, Lalpa ropuizie le kan inzozie inentir dinga a rawng kan ibâwl hi lunginsietna thua hin keini le khuo fang ve dingin kohranhai iruot ve hrim a ni bawk a."
"avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us:","A rawng kan ibâwl, hi thilpêk kawnga hin tûkhawma an mi dem nawna dingin kan fimkhur a,"
"for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.","Lalpa ngai chau ni loin, mihriem ngai khawma thil mawi kan ngaituo bawk hlak a nih."
"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you.","Chun, anni ruolin kan unaupa kan hung tir veh a, ama chu kawng tamtaka ṭhahnemngai tak a nih ti vawi tamtak kan infie tah a, tu lem hin chu a ring bêk bêk cheu leiin ṭhahnem a ngai nâwk zuol tah a nih."
"Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, they are the glory of Christ.","Tita hi chu ka ruolpa le nangni tienga ka sinthawpui a na; chun, kan unauhai hi chu kohranhai tirko, Krista ropuina chu an nih."
"Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.","Chuleichun, in hmangai ti hrietna le, kan suongna cheu hrietna chu kohranhai hmaa chun an kuoma hin suklang ro."
"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:","Mi inthienghai rawngbâwl thu chu in kuoma ka ziek a ngai nawh ie,"
"for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.","inzosa zinga um in nih ti ka hriet sih a, chu kawng thua chun, “Kum khat a ni tah, Akaia ram chu inbuotsaiin an um tah,” tiin Makedonia rama mihai kuomah ka suong hlak cheu a; chuongchun, in ṭhahnemngaina chun anni laia mi tamtak a chawkhar tah a."
"But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared:","Nisienlakhawm, chu kawng thua chun ka suongna cheu chu ieng- khawm lo a hung ni nawna dingin, unauhai hi ka hung tir a nih, ka hril ang taka inbuotsaia in lo um theina dingin;"
"lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.","chuong naw chun Makedonia rama mi tuhaiin amanih mi lo zui kherin, inbuotsai loa an hung hmu cheu chun, keini hi, (nangni kan ti nawh), kan ringna cheu kawnga hin muolpho rawi kan tih."
"I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.","Chuleiin, unauhai hi, thilpêk in itiemlâwk kha lo siem lâwk dinga in kuoma hung hmasa dinga ngên ṭulin ka ring a nih, chu ngei chu lâkpêk ang ni loa, phal taka pêk ang lemin inzosaa a lo umna dingin."
"But this I say, He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.","Amiruokchu, chuong ang kawnga chun, the tlâwm chun sîk tlâwm a ta, the tam chun sîk tam a tih."
"Let each man do according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.","Mi tinin inro puma pe loin, pêk naw thei naw anga ngaia pe bawk loin, an lungrila an tum ang peiin pe seng raw se; Pathien chun hlimtaka petu chu a nih a hmangai chu."
"And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work:","Chun, Pathienin lunginsietna tinrêng in chungah a vur thei a nih; chuongchun, nangnîn iengkimah a hun zet nei rawpin, sin thaw ṭha tinrênga dingin hau thei in tih;"
"as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever.","“A sem dar a; Rimsihai kuomah a pêk a, A felna chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih,” ti ziek ang khan."
"And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:","Chun, thetu kuoma chi petu le, fâk dinga bei petu chun in the ding chi chu pe cheuin, sukpung pêk a ti cheu a, in felna ra chu sukhlâwkpêk a ti cheu."
"ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.","Tiktlaina tinrêng, keini leiin Pathien kuoma lâwmthu hrilna siem- tu chu nei dinga iengkima sukhau- sakin um in tih."
"For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;","Hi sawmdâwlna rawngbâwlna hin, mi inthienghai chu a phu- hrûkpêk chau khawm a ni nawh a, Pathien kuoma lâwmthu hrilna tamtaka inchangin a luong liem bawk a nih."
"seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all;","Hi rawngbâwlna hin a fiena cheu leiin, Krista Chanchin Ṭha in iawi in zâwmzie lei le, anni ta ding le mi po po ta dinga thawlâwm thawnaa in tiktlaizie lei hin Pathien an sukropui hlak in sawnnaw."
"while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.","Anni ngei khawmin in chungah Pathien lunginsietna a nasa bêk bêk leiin, in ta dinga ṭawngṭai pêk zing cheuin an ngai hle cheu a nih."
Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.,A thilpêk hril thei ruollo leiin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu um raw se.
