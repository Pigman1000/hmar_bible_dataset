"The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","Benjamin rama Anathotha um thiempuhai laia mi, Hilkia naupa Jeremia thuhai chu."
"to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.","Ama kuoma chun Juda lal Amon naupa Josia hun lai, a rorêl a kum sâwm le pathum kum chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a,"
"It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.","Juda lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim hun lai, Juda lal Josia naupa Zedekia kum sâwm pakhat kum tâwp chen; Jerusalem sala ṭhuoihmanga a um a thla ngana chen chun a hung tlung zing a."
"Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:"
"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.","“Phîng sûnga ka siem hma che khawma ka hriet cheh a, Sula inthawka i hung suok hma khawma ka sukthieng ta cheh a: Hnamhai kuoma zâwlnei dingin ka lo thlang ta che a nih,” tiin."
"Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child.","Chun, kei chun, “E, Lalpa PATHIEN, ngai ta, thu ka hril thei le; naupang el ka ni sih a,” ka tih a."
"But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun ka kuomah hieng hin a hril a: “Naupang el ka nih, ti naw rawh, Tu kuoma khawm ka tirna phawt che kuoma chun i fe ding a ni sih a; Thu ka pêk ang pei che chun thu hril bawk i tih."
"Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.","Anni lei chun ṭi naw la, Nang chu sanhim ding chein i kuomah ka um sih a; LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
"Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth:","Chun, LALPA chun a kutin a hung ban a, ka bau chu a tâwk tah a; chun, LALPA chun ka kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, i baua chun ka thuhai chu ka sie tah,"
"see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.","En ta, vawisûn hin, hnamhai chunga le ramhai chunga chun, Hrukbit ding le, sukchim ding le, Sukse ding le, Pei thla ding le, bâwl ding le Phun dingin ka sie ta che a nih,” a ta."
"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.","Chu naw khawm chu LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, “Jeremia, ieng am i hmuh a?” a mi tih a. Kei chun, “Almon thing hmawl ka hmu,” ka tih a."
"Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.","LALPA chun ka kuomah, “I hmu ṭha ngawt el; ka thu chu sukpuitlinga um dingin ka tûng tlat a nih,” a ta."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.","Chun, a vawi hninaa chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, “Ieng am i hmuh a?” tiin. Kei chun, “Sumbepui so lai ka hmuh a, chu hmai chu hmâr tienga inthawka hung ngha a nih,” ka tih a."
"Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Hmâr tienga inthawkin ram hluotu- hai po po chungah thil ṭha naw hung so suok a ta."
"For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.","Ngai ta, hmâr tienga lalram sûngkuohai po po chu ka ko ding a ni si a, LALPA chun a tih; chun, hung an ta, mi tin chun Jerusalem dai kawt- khâr lûtnaa le a vêlsuokin kul bang- hai bula le, Juda khawpuihai po poa chun an lalṭhungpha chu hung innghat an tih."
"And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.","Chun, an khawhlonahai thuah anni kalin ka rorêlnahai chu hrilsuok ka tih, kei mi mâksana, pathien danghai kuoma riminhnik rawh a, an kut sinthawhai ngei chu chibai an lo bûk ta leiin."
"Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.","Chuleiin, nang chun i dier kei la, tho la, thu ka pêkhai po po che kha an kuomah hril rawh; annia chun beidawng naw la, chuong naw chun, an hmaa chun sukbeidawng rawi ka ti che."
"For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.","Ngai ta, vawisûn hin ram po po hmaah, Juda lalhai chunga le, chu- taka rorêltuhai chunga le, thiempu- hai chunga le, chu rama mipuihai po po chunga chun dârsen banghai, thîr sûtpuihai le khawpui kul neiah ka siem che hi."
"And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.","Chuongchun, do an ti cheh a; amiruokchu, hne naw ni hai che; nangma sanhim ding chein i kuom- ah ka um sih a, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
"Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:","Aw Israel sûngkuo, LALPAIN i kuoma thu a hril chu lo ngai ta,"
"thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hnamhai lampuihai chu inchûk naw la, chungtienga inchiknahaia chun lunginzîng el bawk naw rawh, hnam- hai chu chuonghaia chun an lungin- zîng hlak sih a."
"For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.","Hnamhai dânhai chu teplo mei mei an na; rama inthawkin thing an hang phûr thlûk a, themthiem mi chun a hreipuiin a chei a."
"They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.","Chu chu tangkaruo le rângka- chakin an chei a; thîrkilnahaiin an sukdet a, tubauhai leh, chuongchun, ân hnîng thei nawh a;"
"They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.","Leipuia vate ṭi milim ang an na, nisienlakhawm, an ṭawng nawh a; an fe thei naw leiin zâwn an ngai a. Anni chu ṭi naw la, thil suol khawm an thaw thei nawh a, annia chun thil ṭha thawna ding khawm a um bawk nawh."
"There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.","Aw LALPA, nanga ang hi tu- khawm an um nawh, i ropuia, i hming chu thilthawtheinain a ropui bawk a."
"Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.","Aw hnamhai Laltak, tuin am ṭi nâwng an ti cheh a? Nang chun i phu hrim sih a, hnamhai laia mi var po po lai le, an lalram sûngahai chun, nang- a ang hrim tukhawm an um nawh."
But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.,"Anni chu ngawngtak le invêt an na, milim inchûktirna chu thing bul el chu a nih."
"There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.","Tangkaruo thlênghaia sut, Tar- sisa inthawka hung lâkhai le, Uphaza inthawka rângkachak, themthiem le rângkachak thîrsu kuthai sinthaw chu: a dum pâwl le a dum êm chu an thuom dingin, mi themthiemhai kutsuok vawng an nih."
"But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.","Amiruokchu, LALPA chau Pathien diktak chu a na, Pathien hring chu a na, chatuon lal a nih; a lunginsenna chun hnuoi chu ân thin a, a lungawi nawna chu hnamhai chun an tuor thei nawh."
"Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.","Hieng hin an kuoma chun hril i tih: hnuoi le vânhai siemtu ni lo pathienhai chu, chuonghai chu vân- khuphnuoia inthawk le leihnuoia inthawk chun bohmang an tih."
"He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens.","A thilthawtheina chun hnuoi chu a siem a, a varna chun khawvêl chu a lo tungding tah a, a hrietthiem- nahai chun vânhai khawm chu a lo keiphar tah a;"
"When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.","a râwl a hung insuo pha chun vânhaia tuihai chu a hung phul a, leihnuoi tâwpnaa inthawk dâm chun tuihu chu ân kaitir a, ruo ta ding chun kâwlinlephai a siem a, a robâwmhaia inthawk chun thli chu a hung lâk suok a."
"Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.","Mi tin el chu ngawngtak, hriet- na nei lo an na; rângkachak suttu tinhai khawm chu a milim kera siem lei chun sukzakin a um a; a milim sunghai chu khêlthu ngawt a na, an- nia chun inthuokna a um si nawh a."
"They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.","Thil teplo, sinthaw nuizatum an nih; hrem an ni pha chun bohmang an tih."
The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.,Jakob chanvo chu hieng ang hi a ni ve nawh a; thil po pohai siemtu chu a na; Israel chu a rochan hnam a na; sipaihai LALPA chu a hming a nih.
"Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.","Aw nang inhuola um, rama inthawk chun i thuomhnawhai chu la khâwm rawh."
"For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Hieng ang huna hin ram hluotuhai chu the suok ka ta, an tuorna dingin anni chu sukrinum ka tih."
"Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.","Ka natna lei chun ka chung a va rik de! ka hliemna chu a nasa hle a; nisienlakhawm, “Indiktakin hi hi ka natna chu a na, ka tuor ding hrim a nih,” ka tih a."
"My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.","Ka puon in chu suksiet a ni tah a; ka hruihai po po khawm suktan an ni tah a; ka nauhai khawm chu keimaa inthawkin an fe hmang a, an um ta nawh a; ka puon in keiphar nâwk ding tukhawm an um ta nawh a, ka puonzârhai zâr ding leh."
"For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.","Berâmpuhai hlak chu an ngawng êm a, LALPA chu an râwn si nawh a; chuleiin, an hlawtling nawh a, an berâm ruolhai po po chu an indar zo a."
"The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.","Thuthang râwl chu, ngai ta, a hung mêk a nih, Juda ram chu râusan le sihalhai chêngna hmuna siem dingin hmâr ram tienga inthawk buoina nasatak a hung mêk a nih."
"O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.","Aw LALPA, mihriem lampui chu amaa chun a um nawh ti ka hriet a; a kepênhai sukdik dingin mihriem- a chun infetirtu chu a um nawh."
"O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.","Aw LALPA, mi sukdik la, ami- ruokchu, rorêlnain, i lunginsennain ni loin, chuong naw chun iengkhawm ni loin mi siem rawi i tih."
"Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.","Khawhri be mi, nang hre lohai chunga le, hnam nangma hming lam ngailohai chunga chun i ṭiumna chu bunthla la, Jakob chu an fâk zo sih a; anih, ama chu an fâk zo a, an kâng- hmang dêr a, a umna khawm chu an suksiet a."
"The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,",LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chun:
"Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;","“Hi thuthlung thuhai hi lo ngai la, Juda rama mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhai kuoma chun hril rawh;"
"and say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant,","chun, an kuoma chun hieng hin hril la; Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi thuthlung thuhai hre lo mi chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se:"
"which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God;","Aigupta ram, thîr sutna pûm meia inthawka anni ka ṭhuoi suok laia, ‘Ka râwl ngai unla, thaw ro, chuongchun, ka mihai nîng in ta, kei khawm in Pathien nîng ka tih,’ tia in thlatuhai kuoma thu ka lo pêk tah thuhai chu."
"that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.","hi vawisûn nia anga hi, nenetui le khuoizua luong ram anni pe dinga ka lo tiem ta chu, in thlatuhai kuoma ka ṭawng inkhâmna chu ka sukpui- tling theina dingin,” tiin. Chun, kei chun “Amen, aw LALPA,” tiin ka dawn a."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah; Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai po po le, Juda khawpuiahai po po chun hienga hril hin va phuong rawh: Hieng thuthlung thuhai hi ngai unla, thaw ro."
"For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.","Aigupta rama inthawka anni ka hung ṭhuoi suok nia inthawk tah vawisûn ni chen khawm hin. “Ka râwl chu awi ro,” tia hrila, inhmataka thoa, anni chu inhriettirin, in thlatu- hai chu ṭhahnemngaitakin ka lo inhriettir tah a."
"Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.","Nisienlakhawm, an awi nawh a, an na khawm an sit bawk nawh a, amiruokchu, mi tin chu mâni lungril ngarna ang pei chun an fe lem a; chuleiin, an chunga chun hi thu- thlung thuhai po po hi ka hung intlungtir a, chuong chu thaw dingin thu ka pêk a, nisienlakhawm, an thaw nawh a,’ tiin."
"And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Juda rama mihai laia le, Jerusalema chênghai laia chun phierrûkna hmuin a um a nih."
"They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.",An thlatuhai ka thu khawm ngai nuom lohai suolna tienga chun an kîr nâwk tah a nih; an rawngbâwl dingin an pathienhai hnung chu an zui a; an thlatuhai le ka lo siem tah ka thuthlung chu Israel sûngkuo le Juda sûngkuo hin an lo bawsiet ta a ni hi.
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, an chungah thil ṭha naw, an pumpel thei dêr lo ding chu ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; ka kuomah hung khêk an ta, nisienla- khawm, anni chu lo ngai naw ning ah."
Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.,"Chun, Juda khawpuihai le, Jerusalem hluotuhai chu, riminhnik an inhlânna pathienhai kuoma chun fêng an ta, ko an tih; nisienlakhawm, chuonga an buoi lai huna chun anni chu sandam ngai hrim hrim naw ni hai."
"For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.","Aw Juda, i khawpui ni zât ang pei el chun i pathienhai chu an um sih a; Jerusalem kawtthlêr zât zâtin inzâpuiumtakin mâichâmhai, Baal kuoma riminhnik rawna ding ngei chu, i lo siem ta bawk a."
"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble.","Chuleiin, hi hnam ta ding hin hni naw la, an ta dingin hnina ama- nih, râwl amanih insuo bawk naw rawh, an buoinaa dinga ka kuoma an khêk pha khawm chun anni chu ka ngai naw ding a ni sih a."
"What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.","Thil tirdakumtak chu thaw zing si chun, ka hmangaitak chun ka inah chan ieng am a nei ta leh?

"Jehovah called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.","LALPA chun i hming a sak a, Oliv thing hring, ra ṭhatak le mawi a ti che a, buoina nasatak ri chun a chunga chun mei a sem a, a kauhai chu a tliek tah a."
"For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto Baal.","Sipaihai LALPA, nangni phun- tu cheu chun Israel sûngkuo le Juda sûngkuoin Baal hmaa riminhnikhai inhlân a, mi suklungsen dinga anni ta dinga thilsuol an lo thaw ta leiin i chungah thil ṭha naw chu a hril lang tah a nih."
"And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou showedst me their doings.","LALPA chun chu chu a mîn hriettir a, ka hriet ngei a; chun, nang chun an thilthawhai chu i mîn entir a."
"But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.","Nisienlakhawm, berâmte zai- nêm a thattu hmaa ṭhuoia um ang chu ka na, “Thing chu chutaka a ra le chun suksieng ei ta, ama chu mi hring rama inthawk chun sât thlâng ei ta, a hming chu hriet zing a ni nawna dingin,” tia, ka chunga thu phierrûk an phier khawm chu ka lo hriet nawh a."
"But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.","Nisienlakhawm, aw sipaihai LALPA, indiktaka rorêltu, lungril le hrietnahai fietu, anni chunga i phubalâkna chu mîn hmutir rawh; nangma kuoma chu ka thu chun ka hung târlang sih a."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand;","Chuleiin, i hringna lâk tumtu Anathoth mihai chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; anni chun, “Kan kuta i thi nawna dingin LALPA hming chun thu hril naw rawh,” an ta;"

"and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.","anni laia tukhawm hla um naw ni hai; Anathoth mihai chunga chun thil ṭha naw, anni hung hremna kum chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?","Aw LALPA, nang chu ka hung ngên lai che chun, i fel a, nangma le chun a san chu ei ngaituo tlâng a, mi rilo lampui chu ieng dinga a hlawtling hlak a, khawhlotaka thawtuhai po po chu nuomsaa um am an na?"
"Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.","Nang chun anni chu i phun tah a, anih, zung khawm an kei a; an hung inṭhang a, ra khawm an hung ra tah a; an baua chun nang chu i hla naw hleh a, an sûnga ruok chu i hla a nih."
"But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, nang chun i mi hriet a, i mi hmuh a, nanga tienga chun ka lungril chu i fieh a, sathattu ta dinga berâmhai ang chun kei suok la, thatna ding nia ang chun anni chu buotsai rawh."
"How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.","Ieng chen am ram chun sûnin, ram pumpui hlohnahai chu a vuoi ding a na? chutaka an rîtlona um zing lei chun, ramsahai le vatehai khawm chu an bohmang a, “Ei ni hnungtieng tâwpna chu hmu naw ni,” an ti leiin."
"If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?","Kea lâwn mihai leh in tlân a, an suksâwl hle che chun, sakawrhai le chun iengtin am inel thei i ta?

"For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.","I unauhai le i pa sûngkuo ngei chun, i chungah khawhlotakin an lo thaw tah a; i hnunga chun an hung khêk rak rak a; anni chu ring naw rawh, i kuoma chun thu ṭhatakhai hril hai sien khawm."
"I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.","Ka in chu ka mâksan tah a, ka rohluona khawm chu ka pei thlâk a, ka thlain a hmangai dittak chu a hmêlmahai kuomah ka pêk tah a."
My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.,"Ka rochan khawm chu ka ta ding chun ramhnuoia sakeibaknei ang a lo ni tah a; ka chunga chun a râwl chu a mîn suo khum a; chuleiin, ama chu ka theida a nih."
"Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.","Ka rochan chu ka ta ding chun vate ṭiel sa fa mi ang a ni a ni ta maw?

"Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.","Berâmpu tamtakhai chun ka grêp huon chu an suksiet a, ka chan chu an ke hnuoiah an sirde a, ka chan inhawitak chu thlalêr ram râusanah an siem tah a."
"They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.",Râusanah an siem tah a; râu- sana umin ka kuoma chun a ṭap a; mi tukhawma lungril a an sie naw leiin ram pumpui chu râusana siem a ni tah a.
Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.,"Thlalêra bâwlhmun tlângahai po po chun suksetuhai chu an hung a, ram pakhat tâwpa inthawka ram dang tâwp chen chun LALPA kâwl- hnâm chun a fâk zo a, tisa hrimin muongna an nei nawh."
"They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.","Bu an chîng a, hling an sîk a; anni chu an insukna a, nisienla- khawm, iengkhawm a hlawk nawh, LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumtak lei chun i rahai chu inzapui i tih."
"Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.","Ka tuolbâwm rilohai po po, ka mi Israelhai hluo dinga ka ti lo tâwk- setu chunga chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, an rama inthawk chun anni chu hmalthlâng ka ta, anni laia inthawk chun Juda sûngkuo chu hmalthlâng ka tih."
"And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.","Anni ka hmalthlâk hnunga chun hung kîr nâwk ka ta, an chung- ah lunginsietna nei ka tih; chun, mi tin chu mâni rochan senga chun hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka ta, mi tin chu mâni ram senga chun."
"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.","Chun, Baal kuoma ṭawng in- khâm dinga ka mihai an inchûktir anga, “LALPA chu a hring zing angin,” tia, ka hminga ṭawng inkhâm dinga, ka mihai lampuihai chu taima- taka an inchûk chun, ka mihai laia chun anni khawm chu siempuitling nîng an tih."

"So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.","Chuongchun, ka feh a, Euphrates vadung sîra chun ka thup tah a, LALPAIN thu a mi pêk ang tak chun."
"And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.","Chun, ni tam tak hnunga chun LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Tho la, Euphrates vadunga khan va fe la, chutaka inthawk chun, thup dinga thu ka pêk che, kha hrên kha va la rawh,” a ta."

"For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.","Hrên chu mi kâwnga a kawp angin, Juda sûngkuo po po le Israel sûngkuo po po chu keimaa kawp dingin ka lo thaw tah a, LALPA chun a tih: keia ta dinga mihai an nih a, hming an nih a, inpâkna an nih a, ropuina an ni theina dingin, nisien- lakhawm, an ngai si nawh a."

"Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?","Aw phairuom le, phaia lungpui hmun hluotuhai, ngai ta u, nangni ka dodâl cheu a nih, LALPA chun a tih: nangni chun, “Ei chungah tu am hung thlâng a ta?

"And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.","in thilthaw ra ang peiin ka hrem ding cheu a nih, LALPA chun a tih; a rampui hnuoia chun mei sêm ka ta, a sîra um po pohai chu kâng hmang vawng a tih."
"Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Juda lal ina chun fe thla la, chutaka chun hi thu hi zu hril rawh:"
"and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates.","Aw nang Juda lal, David lal- ṭhungphaa ṭhung, nang le i siehlaw- hai le i mihai, hieng dai kawtkhâr- haia lûthai hin LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u."
"Thus saith Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Felna le rorêlna chu tirsuok unla, nêksâwrtu kuta inthawk suksieta um chu sansuok ro; thil dik naw chu thaw naw unla, thawluina chu thaw naw unla, hmeithaihai le, mikhuolhai le pa neilohai chunga chun; hi hmuna hin mi thiem thisen chu insuo bawk naw ro."
"For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.","Hieng thilhai hi in thaw ngei ngei chun, hi hi dai kawtkhârahai hin, David lalṭhungphaa ṭhung lalhai, sakawr tawlailîra le sakawr chung- haia chuong, ama le a siehlawhai le a mihai, lût um an tih."

"For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.","Juda lal in chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ka ta ding chun Gilead i na, Lebanon lu leh; nisienlakhawm, matheiloin thla- lêra le khawpui hluo loah ka siem ding che a nih."
"And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.","I chunga chun suksetuhai, mi tin el chu mâni hriemhrei seng leh, ka buotsai ding a nih; anni chun i ditthlang sidar dâm chu sât thlâng an ta, meiah tîng an tih."
"And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?","Hnam tamtakhai chun hi khaw- pui hi fekhêl an ta, mi tin chun mâni tuolbâwm kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea hi khawpui ropuitak hi LALPAIN hieng- a a thaw el am a na?” tîng an tih."
"Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.","Chun, anni chun, “LALPA an Pathien thuthlung chu an nghatsan a, pathien danghai an biek a, an rawng an bâwl leiin a nih,” tiin dawn an tih."
"Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.","Mithi ta dingin ṭap naw unla, ama chu sûn bawk naw ro; ami- ruokchu, mi a fe hmang ta ding chun nasatakin ṭap unla; ama chu a hung kîr ta naw ding lei le, a piengna ram chu a hmu ta naw ding leiin."
"For thus saith Jehovah touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more;","Juda lal Josia naupa Sallum a pa aia rorêla, hi hmun mâksantu chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng- hin a ti sih a:"
"but in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.","“Hitaka hin ama chu hung kîr nâwk ta naw ni; amiruokchu, ama chu sala an ṭhuoina hmuna chun, chutaka chun thîng a ta, hi ram hi hmu nâwk ta naw ni,” tiin."
"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbor’s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire;","A in fel nawnaa bâwltu le, a pindanhai indik lonaa bâwltu chu a chung a rik; ama chun a tuolbâwm sinthawna chu man boin a hmang a, a hlaw khawm a pêk nawh a;"

"Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.","Sidara în huon khum leiin lalah în ngai am a nih? I pa chun a fâkin a dâwn a, indikna le rorêlna chu a thaw a ni nâwm a nih? Chuongchun, ama ta ding chun a hung ṭhah a."
He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.,"Mi tlasamhai le mi rimsihai chungthu chu a rêl a, chuongchun, a ṭhah a. Hi hi keima mi hre dingin a ni nâwm a nih? LALPA chun a tih."
"But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.","Amiruokchu, nanga mithai le i lungril chu inhnarna le, mi thiem thisen insuona ding le, nêksâwrna ding le, thawluina ding le, chu chu thawnaa ding chau naw chu thil dang ding a ni nawh a."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, saying Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!","Chuleiin, Juda lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim chungthua chun LALPAIN hieng hin a tih: Ama chu “Aw ka unaupa,” tiin amanih, “Aw farnu,” tiin amanih, sûn naw ni hai a; “Aw lalpa,” tiin amanih, “Aw a ropuina chu,” tiin amanih, sûn bawk naw ni hai."
"He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.","Sabengtung phûm angin phûm an ta, Jerusalem dai kawtkhârhai khêla hnûka kei dawkin."
"Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed.","Lebanona chun hang fe la, hang khêk rawh: Basana inthawk chun i râwl insuo la, Abarima inthawk chun khêk rawh: i hmangaihai po po chu an bohmang vawng ta sih a."
"I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.","I vângneinaa chun i kuomah thu ka hril a; amiruokchu, nang chun, “Ngai naw ning,” i tih a. I naupang laia inthawk tah hi hi i khawsak dân a ni hrim a; ka râwl hi i ngai ngai nawh."
"The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.","I berâmpuhai po po chu thliin châwm a ta, i hmangaihai chu salah intâng an tih: chu pha chun mathei- loin, i khawhlonahai po po lei chun inzak i ta, buoi ngei ngei i tih."
"O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!","Aw Lebanon hluotu, sidar thinghaia bu septu, nuhmei nauhase nat anga natna, i chunga tuornahai a hung tlung pha chun lungsiet i va um âwm de!"
"As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;","LALPA chun, ka hring zing angin, Jehoiakim naupa Konia chu ka kut changtienga kutsebi sûng- phûm ni sienla khawm, chutaka inthawk chun hmalthlâng ka ti che;"

"And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.","Peisuok ka ti cheh a, i nu chun ram dangah paw lût a ti cheh a, i piengna ram ni loa chun, chutaka chun thîng i tih."
"But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return.","Nisienlakhawm, ram an lung- rilin kîr an nuomna tieng chun kîr nâwk naw ni hai."
"Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?","Hi Konia hi bêl kawi hmusitum am a nih? Ama hi bêl amaa ditna um hlek lo am a nih? Iengdinga pei suoka, ama le a chihai, an ihriet naw rama chu pei suoka um am an na?"
"O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.","Aw leihnuoi, leihnuoi, leihnuoi, LALPA thu chu ngai ta."
"Thus saith Jehovah, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi pa hi nau boah, a dam sûnga mi hlawtling ngai lo dingin ziek rawh, ama chia mi hrim hrim hi tukhawm hlawtling ngai naw ni hai; David lalṭhungphaa ṭhung thua le, Juda rama ro la rêl pei ding thuah."
Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.,Ka hlo petna hmuna berâmhai sukdara sukbohmanghai be- râmpuhai chu an chung a rik! LALPA chun a tih.
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.","Chuleiin, Israel Pathien LALPA chun, ka mihai châwmtu berâmpuhai chungthua chun hieng hin a hril: Ka berâm ruolhai chu in hnawt dar a, in khal hmang tâwl tah a, anni chu in va sir ngai bawk nawh a; ngai ta u, in thilthaw rilohai chun ka hung sir ding cheu a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
"And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.","Ka berâm ruol laia hlâbîkhai chu, ram anni ka hnawt hmangna po poa inthawk chun hung ṭhuoi khâwm ka ta, an huonhaia chun hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka tih; chun, hung pung an ta, hung rahlâwk an tih."
"And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah.","Anni châwmtu ding berâmpu an chunga chun sieng ka ta; ṭit khawm ṭi ta naw ni hai a, beidawng ngai ta bawk naw ni hai a, tlâksam hrim khawm um ta naw ni, LALPA chun a tih."
"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.","Ngai ta, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk; LALPA chun a tih: David-a hin kau feltak chu hung inṭotir ka ta, ama chun lal angin rorêl a ta, vartak- in thâwng a ta; rama chun rorêlna le felna chu suksuok a tih."

"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;","Chuleiin, ngai ta, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk, LALPA chun a tih; Aigupta rama Israel thlahai ṭhuoi suoktu LALPA chu a hring zing angin, ṭi ta naw ni hai a,"

"Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.","Zâwlneihai chungthua chun; ka lungril chu ka sûnga chun a kawiseh a, ka ruhai po po khawm ân hnîng a; zu inrui mi, mi uoinin a hne zet ang el chu ka nih; LALPA lei le, LALPA thu inthienghai lei chun."
"For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;","Ram chu uirehaiin an sip a, ṭawngsie lei chun ram chun a sûn a; thlalêra hlo petna hmunhai khawm chu a ṭâwl zo a; an lampuihai chu a ṭha nawh a, an hrâtna khawm chu ân dik nawh."

"Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.","Chuleiin, an lampui chu an ta dingin inthim laia hmun innâltak ang chu nîng a ta; hnawtin um an ta, chutaka chun tlûng an tih, an chunga chun thil ṭha naw, anni hremna kum ngei chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
"And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.","Samaria zâwlneihaia chun in- vêtna ka hmuh a, anni chun Baal hmangin thu an hril a, ka mi Israelhai chu an insuksuoltir a."
"In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.","Jerusalema zâwlneihaia khawm thil râpthlâktak ka hmuh a; anni chun uiretna thil an thawh a, thukhêlah an feh a, thilsuol thawtu kut chu an sukhrât a, chuongchun, tukhawm an khawhlonaa inthawkin an kîr nawh; an rêng el chun ka ta ding chun Sodom ang an na, chutaka a hluotuhai chu Gomorra ang an nih."

"But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.","Nisienlakhawm, ka rorêlnaa lo ngîr ta chu ni hai sienla, ka mihai chu ka thuhai chu inhriettir an ta, an thilthaw suolhaia inthawk le, an lampui suolhaia inthawk chun inkîr- tir tâng an tih."

Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?,"Ka thu chu mei ang a ni nâwm a nih, lungpui khawm suknawitu tu- bau ang chu? LALPA chun a tih."
"Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.","“Chuleichun, ngai ta u, zâwl- neihai mâni tuolbâwmhaia inthawka ka thu inrutuhai chu ka kal a nih, LALPA chun a tih."

"Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.","Chun, ngai ta, LALPA biekin hmaha sie theichang leikhawr pahni LALPA chun a mîn entir a; Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin Juda lal Jehoiakim naupa Jekonia le Juda rama lalhai le, mi themthiemhai le, thîrsuhai chu Jerusalema inthawka salah a ṭhuoi a, Babulona a hung ṭhuoi tâwl hnung khan."

"Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?","Babulon lal rawng bâwl lo ding hnam chungthua LALPAIN a lo hril ta angin, ieng dingin am nang le i mihai chu hripui dâmin, ṭâmin le kawlhnâma dâm chun thîng in ta?"
"And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.","In kuoma ‘Babulon lal rawng chu in bâwl ding a ni nawh,’ titu zâwlneihai thu chu ngai naw ro: in kuoma chun thukhêl an hril sih a."
"For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.","LALPA chun a tih: Anni chu ka tir si nawh a, nisienlakhawm, ka hmingin thukhêl chu an hril a nih; nangni chu ka hnawt suok theina ding cheu le, nangni le zâwlnei in kuoma thuhriltuhai chu in bohmang theina dingin,” tiin."
"Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.","Thiempuhai le hi hnam po pohai kuoma chun hieng hin ka hril bawk a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In kuomah, ‘Ngai ta u, LALPA bûr le bêlhai chu Babulona inthawkin sâwt- nawtêa hung lâk nîng an tih,’ titu in zâwlneihai thu chu ngai naw ro; in kuomah thukhêl an hril a ni sih a."
"Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?","Anni thu chu ngai naw unla, Babulon lal rawng chu bâwl unla, damin um ro, ieng dingin am hi khawpui hi râusanin um el a ta?"
"But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.","Amiruokchu, zâwlnei an nia, an kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a um chun, tuhin sipaihai LALPA kuoma chun hnina siem hai sienla, LALPA ina bûr le bêl mâksana la umhai le, Jerusalem le lal ina mâksana la umhai chu Babulona a fe ve nawna dingin."
"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,","Sipaihai LALPA chun sûtpuihai chungthua le, châwtawl lien chung- thua le, ân ṭhutna chungthua le, khawpuia bûr le bêl mâksana la umhai chungthua chun, hieng hin a tih:"
"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;",chuong Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzarin Juda lal Jehoiakim naupa Jekonia chu sala Jerusalema in- thawka Babulona Jerusalem le Juda rama mi ṭhahai po po chu sala a ṭhuoi laia a lâk sa ve nawhai chung- thu chu;

"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.","Babulona chun phur hmang nîng an ta, chutaka chun um an tih, anni ka va sir ni chen chun, LALPA chun a tih: chun, hung la nâwk tâwl ka ta, hi hmuna hin sie nâwk ka tih,” tiin."
"And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,","Chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia rorêl ṭantir, a kum lina, a thla ngana, chu kum ma chun zâwlnei Azzur naupa Hanania, Gibeon mi chun, mipuihai po po le thiempuhai hmaihmaah, LALPA ina chun ka kuomah hieng hin thu a hril a,"
"Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.",“Israel Pathien sipaihai LALPA chun hienghin a tih: Babulon lal rîngkawl chu ka sukthliek tah a.
"Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:","Kum hni pumhlûm sûngin LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai po po Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin hi hmuna inthawka a lâk a, Babulona a phurhai kha hi hmuna hin hung la kîr nâwk vawng ka ta;"
"and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.","hi hmuna hin Juda ram lal Jehoiakim naupa Jekonia le Juda sal intânghai po po Babulona fe tahai chu hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk ka ta; LALPA chun a tih; Babulon lal rîngkawl chu ka sukthliek ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah,","Chun, thiempuhai, mipui po po LALPA ina ngîrhai kuoma chun zâwlnei Jeremia chun zâwlnei Hanania kuomah,"
"even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Jehovah do so; Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovah’s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place.","zâwlnei Jeremia ngei chun a hril a, “Amen: LALPA chun chuong chun thaw raw se; Babulona inthawka hi hmuna, sala lo intânghai po po le, LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai chu hung la kîr dingin, i thuhril chu LALPA chun thaw raw se."
"Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:","Nisienlakhawm, mipui po po na hrieta le nangma na hriet ngeia hi thu ka hril hi tuhin lo ngai ta;"
"The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.","Zâwlnei keia hma le nangma hmaa, kha hmaa lo um tahai khan ram tamtak chunga le, lalram ropui- takhai chunga le, indo thu dâm, thil ṭha naw thu dâm, hripui thu dâm an lo hril hlak a."
"The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath truly sent him.","Zâwlnei thlamuongna thu hriltu chu, chu zâwlnei thuhril chu a hung tlung pha chun, chu zâwlnei chu LALPA chun ama chu a tir taktak a nih ti hriet a nih,” tiin."
"Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.","Chun, zâwlnei Hanania chun zâwlnei Jeremia rînga rîngkawl chu a lâk a, a sukthliek tah a."
"And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.","Chun, Hanania chun mipuihai po po hmaihmaa chun thu a hril tah a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hnam po pohai rînga inthawkin kum hni pumhlûm sûngin Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar rîngkawl chu hieng ang ngei hin ka sukthliek ding a nih, a tih,” a ta, zâwlnei Jeremia ruok chu a fe hmang tah a."
"Then the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, zâwlnei Hananiain zâwl- nei Jeremia rînga inthawka rîngkawl a sukthliek hnung chun Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu hieng ang hin a hung tlung a,"
"Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.","“Fe la, Hanania chu hieng ang hin va hril rawh: LALPA chun hieng- hin a tih: Thinga siem rîngkawlhai chu i sukthliek a; amiruokchu, an aia chun thîrin rîngkawl i siem ding a nih."
"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.","Israel Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar rawng chu an bâwl theina dingin hieng hnam po pohai rînga hin thîr rîngkawl chu kân kawl- tir tah a nih; ama rawng chu bâwl an ta, ramhnuoia ram sahai chenin ama chu ka pêk tah a nih,” tiin."
"Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.","Chun, zâwlnei Jeremia chun zâwlnei Hanania kuoma chun, “Hanania, tuhin lo ngai ta, LALPA chun nang a tir naw cheh a, nisien- lakhawm, hi mipui hi khêlthu chu în ringtir a ni hi."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, leihnuoi chunga in- thawk hin ka tir hmang ding che a nih; LALPA kala khêlthu i hril leiin, tu kum hin i thi ding a nih,” tiin."
So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.,"Chuongchun, zâwlnei Hanania chu chu kum ma thla sarinaa chun a thi tah a."
"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,","Tuhin, sal intâng upa la um- sunhai le, thiempuhai le, zâwl- neihai le, mipui po po Jerusalema inthawka Babulona Nebukadnezzar- in sala a ṭhuoihai kuoma zâwlnei Jeremia lekhathawn thuhai chu hienghai hi an nih:"
"(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem),","(lal Jekonia le lalnu nu le, mi tillâkhai le, Juda ram le Jerusalema lalhai le, mi themthiemhai le, thîrsu- hai leh Jerusalem an suoksan hnung chun a nih)."
"by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,","Saphan naupa Elasa le, Hilkia naupa Gemaria (Babulon lal Nebu- kadnezzar kuoma Juda ram lal Zedekian Babulona a tirhai) kuta chun thawn a nih"
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:","Jerusalema inthawka Babulona sala intâng dinga kân ṭhuoihmang- tirhai po po kuoma chun, sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng- hin a tih:"
"Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.","Inhai bâwl unla, a sûngahai chun chêng unla, huonhai chu siem unla, an rahai chu fa bawk ro;"
"Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters: and multiply ye there, and be not diminished.","nuhmeihai nei unla, naupasal- hai, naunuhmeihai nei unla: in naupasalhai nuhmei inneitir unla, in naunuhmeihai khawm pasal inneitir bawk unla, naupasalhai le naunu- hmeihai an nei theina dingin; chu- taka chun hung pung pei unla, kiem tieng pan ta naw ro."
"And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.","Chun, sala intâng dinga kân ṭhuoihmangtirna cheu khawpuia inremna chu zawng unla, chu chu LALPA kuoma chun hni ro; chutaka inremna lei chun muongna in nei ding a ni sih a."
"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.","Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Nangni laia in zâwlnei umhai le, in khawhri zâwl- haiin hlêm naw raw se cheu, chun, in manghai in imang khawm chu ring bawk naw unla."
"For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.","Keia hmingin khêlin in kuomah thu an hril hlak sih a; anni chu ka tir an ni nawh, LALPA chun a tih."
"For thus saith Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a; Babulona intâng kum sâwmsari a tling hnunga chun, hung sir ka ti cheu a, hi hmuna inkîrtir ding cheuin in kuoma chun ka thu tiem chu hlen ka tih."
"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.","Nangni tieng panga ka ngaituo, thil ngaituohai chu ka hriet sih a, LALPA chun a tih, in tâwpna tienga beiseina siempêk ding cheuin thil ṭha naw ni loin, thlamuongna lungril a ni lem."
"And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.","Chun, kei chu mi hung ko in ta, fêng in ta, ka kuoma chun ṭawngṭai in ta, chun, kei khawma lo ngai ka ti cheu."
"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.","Mi zawng in ta, in lungril po poa in mi zawng pha chun mi hmûng in tih."
"And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.","Nangni ihmuin um ka ta, LALPA chun a tih: chuongchun, in sal intângna chu inlet ka ta, ka hnawt hmangna cheu hmun po poa inthawk le, hnam po pohaia inthawk chun ṭhuoi khâwm ka ti cheu a, LALPA chun a tih; chun, sala intâng dinga ṭhuoi hmanga kân umtirna cheu hmuna bawk khan hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk ka ti cheu."
"Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;","“LALPA chun Babulona khawm chun zâwlneihai a hung siem tah a,” in ti leiin,"
"thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;","David lalṭhungphaa ṭhung lal chungthua le, chu khawpuia mipui chêng po pohai, in unauhai nangni le sala intâng dinga fe ve nawhai chung- thua chun LALPAIN hieng hin a tih:"

"And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them;","Chun, anni chu kâwlhnâm le ṭâm le hriin hnawt ka ta, anni ka tir hmangna tieng hnamhai po po laia chun thusekawk ding le, inchekna ding le, makti ding le, mi ṭawng- dâwng dingin hnuoia lalram po po laia hnungtieng hmatienga nawr- lênga um dingin pe suok ka tih;"

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;","Ka hminga in kuoma thukhêl hriltu Maaseia naupa Zedekia chung thua le, Kolaia naupa Ahab chung- thua chun Israel Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, anni chu Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzar kuta chun pe suok ka ta, ama chun in mithmuah anni chu that a tih;"

"because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.","Israel rama chun invêtthlâk- takin thil an thawh a, an tuolbâwm- hai nuhmei le chun an uireh a, ka hming sâlin ka thupêk loa khêl thu an hril leiin; chun, kei chu a hretu, a hrietpuitu chu ka nih, LALPA chun a tih."
"And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,","Chun, Nehelam mi Semaia chungthua chun hieng ang hin thu hril i tih:"
"Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,","Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Jerusalema mi- pui um po pohai, thiempu Masseia naupa Zephania kuoma leh, thiem- puhai po po kuoma chun hieng anga nangma hminga lekha i thawn leiin:"
"Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.","“Thiempu Jehoiada aia chun LALPA chun thiempuah a siem ta cheh a, chuongchun, LALPA ina chun hotu nîng i ta, chun, mi tukhawm ân vêt a, ama le ama zâwlneia ân siem chun, ama chu intângna ina siein, kawl inbuntir i tih."
"Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,","Chuleiin, tuhin ieng dinga Ana- thotha mi Jeremia in kuoma zâwlnei inti hi i kâwk naw am a na?"
"forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?","ama chun, ‘Sal intâng sûng ding hi a sâwt a, inhai bâwl unla, a sûnga- hai chun chêng unla, huonhai siem unla, a rahai chu fa ro,’ tiin Babulon- ah thu a mi thawn si a” tiin."
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.,"Chun, thiempu Zephania chun zâwlnei Jeremia na hrieta chun hi lekhathawn hi a tiem tah a."
"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
"Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;","“Sal intânghai po po kuoma chun mi tir la.

"therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Nehelam mi Semaia le a thlahai chu hrem ka ta; hi hnam laia chêng ding hi mi nei naw nih a, ka mihai laia thil ṭha ka thaw khawm chu hmu bawk naw ni, LALPA chun a tih: LALPA chunga helna thu a lo hril ta leiin,” tiin."
"They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah.","“Miin a nuhmei a mâk a, ama chu a mâksan a, pasal dang ta a hung ni tah a, amapa chu amanu kuoma chun a lût nâwk ding am a nih?

"Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.","Bâwlhmun tienghai khi i mithai khan hang thlîr la, en ta; an zâlpui nawna che khaw lai am a um a?

"Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hadst a harlot’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.","Chuleiin, raw sûrhai chu chel- tâng an na, ruo nuhnung tieng chu a um ta naw a nih; amiruokchu, mi hur chal chu i nei a, inzak i tum dêr si nawh a."
"Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?","Tuta inthawk hin, ‘Ka pa, nang chu ka tleirâwlna ṭhuoitu i nih,’ tiin ka kuomah i khêk naw dîm a nih?"
"Will he retain his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.","A lunginsenna chu a kawl zing dîm a nih?

"Moreover Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.","Chu nawa khawm chun lal Josia hun lai chun ka kuomah LALPA chun a hril a, “Israel hnungtawlin a lo thaw ta hi i hmu am?

"And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.","Hieng thilhai po po hi a thaw zo hnung chun ka kuomah hung kîr i tih, ka tih a, nisienlakhawm, a hung kîr si nawh a, a zuorpuinu rilotak Juda khawm chun ama chu a hmuh a."
"And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.","Israel hnungtawl chun uiretna thil a lo thaw ka hmu lei tak chun ama chu ka mâk a, inmâkna lekha ka pêk tah ti a hmu sa khawmin a zuor- puinu rilotak Juda chun ṭitna châng a hriet chuong nawh a, ama ngei khawm chu a fe a, nawchizawrah a khawsa ve tah a."
"And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.",A hurna inruina lei chun ram chu sukpawrchein a um tah a; thingbul- hai le lunghai le chun a lo uire tah a.
"And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.","Hieng thil po pohai lei khawm hin a zuorpuinu hlêm hmang Juda chu a lungril po po leh a hung kîr naw ta rawp a, a la tehlêm lem a, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Juda rilotak nêk hin Israel hnung- tawl khawm hi fel lemin ân lang ie."
"Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I will not keep anger for ever.","Fe la, hi thuhai hi hmâr tienga chun va phuong la, ‘Hung kîr rawh, nang Israel hnungtawl, LALPA chun a tih; i chunga chun lunginsenin en naw ning cheh a, zângai theitak ka ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih, lunginsenna chu kumkhuoin kawl zing naw ning."
"Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah.","I suolna chu hre phawt phawt la, LALPA i Pathien chunga chun i lo bawsiet tah a, thing hring tin hnuoia chun hmêlmakhai kuomah i lo inphal tah a, ka râwl khawm chu i awi bawk ta nawh a, LALPA chun a tih."

"Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.","Chuongchun, chu huna chun Babulon lal sipaihai chun Jerusalem chu an inhuol a; chun, zâwlnei Jeremia khawm chu Juda ram lal ina vêngtu kulbînga chun khârkhumin a um a."
"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;","Juda ram lal Zedekia chun ama chu a khum a, “Ieng dinga hienga thu hi i hril am a na?, ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hi khawpui hi Babulon lal kuta chun pêng ka ta, ama chun lâng a tih."
"and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;","Juda ram lal Zedekia khawm chu Kaldaihai kuta inthawk chun suok- thleng naw nih a; amiruokchu, Babulon lal kuta chun matheiloin pêk ni lem a tih, ama chu bau le bau inphâkin bieng a ta, a mithai chun ama mithai chu hmu bawk a tih;"
"and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?","chun, Zedekia chu Babulona chun ṭhuoi a ta, ka va sir hmakhat chun chutaka chun um zing a ta, LALPA chun a tih: Kaldaihai chu do unla khawm, hlawtling naw ti niu,’ i tih a,” a ta."
"And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Jeremia chun a hril a, “LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, hieng hin a hril,"
"Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.","Ngai ta, i pami Sallum naupa Hanamel chu i kuomah hung a ta, ‘Anathotha um ka lo inchaw rawh, inchaw dinga intlansuokna thuneina chu nangma ta a ni sih a,’ tîng a ta."
"So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, ka pami naupa Hanamel chu vêngtu kulbînga chun LALPA thu ang pei chun ka kuomah a hung a, ka kuoma chun, ‘Ka ngên che, ka lo Anathotha um, Benjamin rama um chu inchaw rawh; rohluona thuneina chu nangma ta a ni sih a, intlansuokna khawm chu nangma ta bawk a na, i ta dingin inchaw el rawh,’ a hung tih a."
"And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.","Chun, kei chun chu chu LALPA thu a nih ti ka hriet a. Chun, ka pami naupa Hanamel lo Anathotha um chu kân châwk tah a; tangka shekel sâwm- pasari chu ama ka bûkpêk tah a."
"And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.","Chun, thuziek chu suoi ka thawh a, ka nam tah a, chun, hriet- puitu ka ko a, ama chu bûkna chun tangka chu ka bûkpêk tah a."
"So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open:","Chun, dân ang le hmangchâng ang peiin, inchâwkna thuziek chu ka lâk a, chu chu hawng a na;"
"and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.","vêngtu kulbînga Juda ṭhanghai po po hmaa chun, inchâwkna thu- zieka hrietpuitu mithmua chun, ka pami naupa Hanamel hmaihmaah, inchâwkna thuziek chu Maaseia naupa, Neria naupa Baruk kuoma chun ka pêk tah a."
"And I charged Baruch before them, saying,","An hmaa chun Baruk chu thu ka pêk tah a,"
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.","‘Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Hieng thuziek- hai, inchâwkna thuziek, chara um le hawngsaa um hi la la, pil bêlah va sie rawh; ni sâwttak el an um theina dingin."

"Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying,","“Chun, Neria naupa Baruk kuoma inchâwkna thuziek chu ka pêk hnung chun LALPA kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai tah a."

"and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.","chuongchun, an hung lût a, an nei a, nisienlakhawm, i râwl chu an awi nawh a, i dân khawm chu an zâwm bawk nawh a; anni chun thaw dinga thu i pêkhai a iengkhawm chu an thaw nawh a; chuleiin, thil ṭha naw tinrêng chu an chunga chun în tlungtir a,"
"Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.","en ta u, khawpui lâkna dingin hnuoi dêng pâwnghai an hung um ta hi, nangin hung tlung dinga i hril angin, hripui le, ṭâm le kâwlhnâm leiin, a hung dotu Kaldaihai kuta chun khawpui chu pêk a ni tah a; en ta, i hmu zing hi."
"And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.","Ka kuoma chun Aw LALPA Pathien, “Lo chu tangkain inchaw la, hrepuituhai ko la,” i ta, nisienla- khawm, khawpui chu Kaldaihai kuta pêk a ni ta sih a,’” tiin."
"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?","“Ngai ta, mi tinrêng Pathien, LALPA chu ka nih, keia ta dingin thil intak taluo a um am a nih?"
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hi khawpui hi Kaldaihai kuta le Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar kuta chun pêng ka ta, ama chun lâng a tih;"
"and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.","chun, hi khaw hung dotu Kaldaihai chu hung an ta, hi khuo hi meiin hung râwng an ta, a inhai a chunga Baal kuoma riminhnik an râwna le, kei mi suklungsenna dinga pathien danghai kuoma dâwn mi thilinhlânhai an lo bunthlâkna inhai le chun kâng a tih."
"For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.","An naupang laia inthawk tah Juda thlahai le Israel thlahai hin ka mithmuah thil suol chu an lo thaw hlak sih a; Israel thlahai chun an kut sinthawhai chun an mi lo suklungsen sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
"For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,","Hi khawpui hi an bâwl ṭan nia inthawk vawisûn ni chen hin, keia ta ding chun ka ṭiumna le ka lungin- senna chawkthona chau a nih; chuongchun, ka hmaihmaa inthawk- in ka sawn hmang ding a nih;"
"because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Juda thlahai le Israel thlahai suolna po po, mi suklungsenna ding ela, anni le an lalhai le an rorêltuhai le, an thiempuhai le, an zâwlneihai le, Juda rama mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhaiin an lo thaw tahai lei chun."
"And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.","Chun, kei chu hmatieng ni loin, hnungtieng an mînnghat a, inhma- taka thoa anni inchûktirin, anni chu ka lo inchûktira chu, inchûktirna chu hre dingin an ngai si nawh a."
"But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.","Amiruokchu, an tirdakumna chu ka hming chawia sak in chu sukpawrche dingin an sieh a."
"And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.","Hinnom phairuoma um Baal bâwlhmunhai chu Molek kuoma an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai meia infethlengtirna dingin an bâwl a, Juda chu suol inthawtir dingin, hi tirdakumna dâm hi thâwng an tih ti ka lungrila khawm a lût ngainawh."
"And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:","“Chuleiin, tuhin, hi khawpui, ‘Hripui le, ṭâm le, kâwlhnâmah Babulon lal kuta pêk a ni tah,’ i ti chungthua hin Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:"

"and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.","Anni chu sukṭha dingin, annia inthawka kân her hmang nawna dingin, anni le chun kumkhaw thu- thlung siem ka ta; chun, an lungrila chun keia ṭina sieng ka ta, keimaa inthawk chun fe hmang ta naw ni hai."
"Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.","Anih, anni chu sukṭha dingin an chungah hlim tâng ka ta, hi rama hin ka lungril po po le, ka lungvar po poin thudikah anni chu phun ka tih."
"For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Hi hnam chunga hieng thil ṭha naw nasatakhai po po kân tlungtir ang bawk hin, an chunga hin thil ṭha an kuoma ka tiem tahai po po chu hung intlungtir vêng ka tih."
"And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.","Chun, ‘Ramsahai le mihriem boin, râusan a ni tah a; Kaldaihai kuta pêk a ni tah,’ in ti, hi rama hin lohai chu inchâwk nîng a ta."
"Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah.","Mihaiin lohai chu tangka sumin inchâwng an ta, thuziek chu ziek det an ta, châr an tih, hrietpuituhai ko an ta, Benjamin rama dâm, Jerusalem vêla hmunahai dâm, tlângram khaw- puiahai dâm, phairuoma khawpuia- hai dâm, Sima khawpuiahai dâm chun: an sal intângnaa inthawkin kân kîrtir ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih” tiin."
"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,",Chu nawa khawm vêngtu kulbînga khârkhum a ni sûng chun a vawi hninaah Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:

"For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defence against the mounds and against the sword;",Hi khawpui inhai chungthua le Juda ram lalhai in kâwlhnâm le hnuoi dêng pâwng lama inthawka dangna siemna dinga sukchima um- hai chungthua chun Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:

"And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.","Juda sal intângna le Israel sal intângna chu inlamlêttir ka ta, a tîra ang khan anni chu rem ka tih."
"And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.","An suolna po po, ka chunga an lo suksuolnahaia inthawk khan anni chu sukthieng ka ta, an bawsietnahai po po chu ngaidam ka ta, ka chunga an lo suksuolnahai le, ka chunga an lo bawsietnahai chu."
"And this city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.","Chun, hnuoi chunga hnam po pohai, an chunga thil ṭha ka thaw po po hretuhai le, thil ṭha po po le thlamuongna po po a ta dinga kân neitir hretuhai ṭiin inthin an tih; ka ta dingin hi khawpui hi hlimna hming le, inpâkna ding le ropuina ding hung nîng a tih."

"In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth them, saith Jehovah.","Tlângrama khawpuiahai le, phairuoma khawpuiahai le, Sima khawpuiahai le, Benjamin rama khawpuiahai le, Jerusalem vêl hmun- ahai le, Juda khawpuiahai chun berâm ruolhai chu anni tiemtu kut hnuoiah la tla nâwk an tih, LALPA chun a tih:"

For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;,"“LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Israel sûngkuo lalṭhungpha chung- a ṭhung ding, David chun mi tlasam ngai naw ni;"

"And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a,"

"And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a,"

"that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, that is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondmen of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.","“Mi tin chun a siehlawpa ama- nih, a siehlawnu amanih, Hebraipa amanih, Hebrainu amanih a ni chun, zalênin insuoktir a ta; a unau Juda chanpui rawngbâwlpêkin tukhawm a um ding a ni nawh”, tiin;"
"And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:","chun, mipui po po le rorêltuhai po po chun an remtih a; thuthlung chu an awi tah a, chuongchun, mi tin chun mâni siehlawpa amanih, mi tin chun mâni siehlawnu amani chu zalênin insuoktir a ta, tukhawma ama rawng chu bâwlpêk ni ta naw ni; chu chu an awi a, an infetir tâwl tah a:"
"but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.","nisienlakhawm, chu hnunga chun an lamlêt a, siehlawpahai le siehlawnuhai chu zalêna an lo insuoktir tahai chu kîr dingin an ti nâwk a, siehlawpahai ding le sie- hlawnuhai ni dingin thununna hnuoiah an lâk lût nâwk tah a;"
"Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,","chuleiin, LALPA thu chu LALPA kuoma inthawk chun Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung a;"
"Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,","“LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Intângna ina in- thawk, Aigupta rama inthawka anni ka ṭhuoi suok lai chun in thlatuhai kuoma chun hienga hril hin thuthlung ka lo siem tah a:"
"At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.","‘Mi tinin a unaupa Hebrai mi nia, ama kuoma zawra lo um amanih, ama chu kum ruk sûng rawng lo bâwlpêk ta chu, kum sari tâwpa chun infetir in ta, nangmaa inthawk chun a thlâwnin în fetir ding a nih,’ tiin, nisienlakhawm, in thlatuhai chun an mi ngai nawh a, an na khawm an sit nawh."
"And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:","Chun, tu el khawm in hung lamlêt a, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm ta dinga zalênna phuongin, ka mit- hmuah thilindik chu in thaw tah a; chun, ka hming chawia ko ina chun ka hmaah thuthlung khawm chu in lo siem ta bawk a."
"but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.","Amiruokchu, in inher a, ka hming chu in sukpawrche tah a; mi tin chun a siehlawpa le a siehlawnu, an nuom anga zalêna in infetir tahai chu in inkîrtir nâwk tah a; thununna hnuoia chun in lâklût nâwk a, in ta dinga siehlawpahai le siehlawnuhai ni dingin."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Mi tinin mâni unaupa chunga le, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm chunga zalênna phuong dingin ka thu in ngai naw a nih; ngai ta u, kâwlhnâm kuoma le, ṭâm kuoma le hripui kuoma chun in ta dingin zalênna chu ka phuong a nih, LALPA chun a tih: chuongchun, leihnuoia lalram po pohai laia hnungtieng hmatienga hnawt lêng dingin ka siem ding cheu a nih."
"And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;","Chun, ka thuthlung bawsetu mihai, bâwngtê chu tum hnia chana a kâra fethleng ka hmaa an thuthlung thuhai thaw si lohai chu pêng ka ta;"

"I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.","anni khawm chu an hringna zawngtuhai le, an hmêlmahai kuta chun pêng ka tih; chuongchun, an taksa thihai khawm chu hnuoia ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai ta dinga bu nîng a tih."
"And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, that are gone away from you.","Chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia le a rorêltuhai khawm chu an hmêlmahai kuta le, an hringna zawngtuhai kuta le, nangnia inthawka hang fe, Babulon lal sipaihai kuta chun pêng ka tih."
"Behold, I will command, saith Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.","Ngai ta u, thu pêng ka ta, hi khawpuia hin hung inkîrtir ka tih; LALPA chun a tih: chun, do an ta, lâng an ta, meiin râwng an tih; chuongchun, Juda khawpuihai chu hluotu um loa râusanah siem ka tih,” tiin."
"The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,",Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim hun laia LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chun hieng hin a tih:

"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;","Chun, Habazzinia naupa, Jeremia naupa Jaazania le a unau- hai le a naupasalhai po po le, Rekab sûngkuohai po po chu ka ṭhuoi a;"
"and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.","Pathien mi Igdalia naupa Hanan naupasalhai pindan, kawtkhâr vêng- tu Sallum naupa Maaseia pindan chunga um, rorêltuhai pindan sîra um LALPA ina chun anni chu ka hung ṭhuoi a;"
"And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.","chun, Rekab sûngkaw naupa- salhai hmaa chun maihûn uoina sip le nohai ka sieh a, an kuoma chun, “Uoin hi dâwn ro,” ka tih a."
"But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun an dawn a, “Uoin chu dâwn naw ning ungah; kan thlatu Rekab unaupa Jonadab chun hieng hin thu a mi pêk sih a: ‘Kumkhuoin nangniin amanih, in naupasalhai khawmin amanih uoin hi dâwn ngai naw ti niu a;"

"And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;","Chuongchun, kan thlatu Rekab naupa Jonadab râwl chu, kan dam sûng po poa, keini le kan nuhmeihai le kan naupasalhai le, kan naunu- hmeihai le, uoin dâwn lo dinga a mi tiem chu kan awi a;"

"but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.","puon inahai chun kan chêng a, kan thlatu Jonadabin thu a mi pêk ang taphawt chun kan zâwm a nih."
"But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.","Amiruokchu, Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chu hi rama hin a hung lai khan, ‘Thaw ro, Kaldai sipaihai ṭi lei le, Suria sipaihai ṭi leiin, Jerusalemah hang fêng ei tiu,’ kan tih a; chuongchun, Jerusalema chun kan hang chêng tah a,” tiin."
"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a:"
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.","“Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Fe la, Juda ram mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhai kuoma chun hi hi va hril rawh: ‘Ka thuhai chu ngai dingin, inchûktirna chu in pawm naw ding am a nih?’ LALPA chun a tih."
"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me.","Uoin dâwn lo dinga thu a naupasalhai a ipêk, Rekab naupa Jonadab thuhai chu thawin a um a, vawisûn ni chen hin an dâwn nawh a, an thlatu thupêk chu an pawm leiin: amiruokchu, zîngkâra thoa thuhrilin, in kuoma chun thu ka hrila chu in ngai si nawh a."
"I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.","Chun, zîngkâra thoa anni hung tirin, ‘Mi tin chu mâni lampui suola inthawk chun hung kîr unla, in thil- thawhai chu siemṭha unla, pathien danghai chu an rawng bâwl dingin zui bawk naw ro, chuongchun, nangni le in thlatuhai kuoma ram ka ipêk cheua hin chêng in tih,’ tiin, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai po po chu in kuomah ka hung tir a; nisienla- khawm, in na khawm in sit nawh a, ngai khawm in mi ngai naw kha."
"Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;","Rekab naupa Jonadab naupa- salhaiin an pain thu a pêk an thaw vei leh, hi mihai hlak hin an mi ngai si nawh a;"
"therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.","chuleiin, LALPA, Sipaihai Pathien, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Juda ram chunga le Jerusalem hluotuhai po po chunga chun, an chunga thil ṭha naw tlung ding ka hril ta kha ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; an kuomah thu ka hril a, an ngai naw leiin, anni chu ka ko a, an mi dawn naw leiin,” tiin."
"And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;","Chun, Jeremia chun Rekab sûngkuohai kuoma chun a hril a, “Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: In thlatu Jona- dab thupêk chu in awi a, a dânhai po po chu in pawm a, a thupêk ang tak cheua in thaw leiin;"
"therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.","sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Rekab naupa Jonadab hin kumkhuoin ka hmaa ngîr ding mi tlasam ngai naw ni,” tiin."
"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,",Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim inlal kum linaa chun hi thu hi LALPA kuoma in- thawk chun Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung tah a:
"Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.","“Lekhabu zuol la la, chutaka chun Israel ram chungthu le, Juda ram chungthu le, hnam po pohai chungthu, Josia hun laia inthawka i kuoma thu ka hril nia inthawka vawisûn ni chena mi hi, thu ka hrilhai po po chu ziek rawh."
It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.,"An chunga thil ṭha naw thaw ka tum chu Juda sûngkuohai chun an hrietin, an suolna chu ka ngaidam theina dingin mi tin chu mâni um dân suola inthawk chun an hung kîr rawi mawh,” tiin."
"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.","Chun, Jeremia chun Neria naupa Baruk chu a ko a; Baruk chun LALPAIN a kuoma thu a hrilhai po po chu lekhabu zuola chun Jeremia baua inthawk chun a ziek tah a."
"And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:","Jeremia chun Baruk chu thu a pêk a, “Kei chu khum ka na, LALPA ina chun ka fe thei nawh a;"
"therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah’s house upon the fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.","chuleiin, nang va fe la, lekhabu zuola ka baua inthawka LALPA thuhai i ziekhai kha bunghei niin LALPA inah mipui na hrieta chun va tiem rawh; chun, Juda mi an khawpuihaia inthawka hung suokhai po po na hrieta chun tiem bawk rawh."
"It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.","An hnina chu LALPA hmaa pein, mi tin chu mâni um dân suola inthawk chun an hung kîr rawi mawh: hi mihai chunga lunginsenna le ṭitumna LALPAIN a hril chu a nasa hle sih a,” tiin."
"And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah’s house.","Chun, Neria naupa Baruk chun, LALPA ina chun LALPA thuhai chu lekhabua chun tiemin zâwlnei Jeremia thupêk po po angtak chun a thaw tah a."
"Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.","Chun, Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim inlal kum ngana, thla kuonaa chun Jerusalema mi po pohai, Juda ram khawpuihaia inthawka Jerusalema mipui hung po pohai chun LALPA hmaa bunghei chu an phuong tah a."
"Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s house, in the ears of all the people.","Chun, mipui po po na hrieta chun, LALPA in dai kawtkhâr thar lûtnaa, huong sûng tuollai chung- hnung lema um, lekhaziektu Saphan naupa Gemaria pindanah, LALPA ina chun Baruk chun Jeremia thuhai chu a tiem tah a."
"And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,","Chun, Saphan naupa, Gemaria naupa Mikaia chun lekhabua LALPA thu po pohai chu a hriet chun,"
"he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes were sitting there, to wit, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.","lekhaziektuhai pindanah lal ina chun a zu fe thla tah a; chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun lalhai po po, lekhaziek- tu Elisama, Semaia naupa Delaia, Akbor naupa Elnathan, Saphan naupa Gemaria, Hanania naupa Zedekia le lalhai po po chu an ṭhung a."
"Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.","Chun, Mikaia chun mipui na hrieta Barukin lekhabu chu a tiem laia a lo hriet thuhai po po chu anni kuoma chun a hrilfie tah a."
"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.","Chuleiin, lalhai po po chun Kusi naupa Selemia, chu naupa Nethania naupa Jehudi chu Baruk kâwlah an tir a, “Mipuihai na hrieta lekha zuol i tiemna kha la la, hung chawi la, hung rawh,” tiin. Chuongchun, Neria naupa Baruk chun Lekhabu zuol chu a kutin a lâk a, an kuoma chun a hung tah a."
"And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Tuhin ṭhung la, kan na hrieta hin tiem ta,” an tih a. Chuongchun, Baruk chun an na hrieta chun a tiem tah a."
"Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.","Chun, chuong thuhai po po chu an hriet chun, anni le anni chu an inṭi tuo seng tah a, chuongchun, Baruk kuoma chun, “Hieng thuhai po po hi lal chu hril ngei ngei kan tih,” an tih a."
"And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?","Chun, Baruk kuoma chun, “A baua inthawk chun hieng thuhai po po hi ieng tiziea ziek am i na, mi hril rawh,” tiin an indawn a."
"Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.","Baruk chun anni chu a dawn a, “A bauin hieng thuhai po po hi ka kuomah a hung hril a, kei chun lekha- bua chun lekhatuiin ka lo ziek el a nih,” tiin."
"Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.","Chuongchun, lalhai chun Baruk kuoma chun, “Fe la, Jeremia le nang chu inbihmang ro, khaw lai am in um ti tukhawm inhriettir naw ro,” an tih a."
And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.,"Chun, anni chu huong sûng tuollaia chun lal kuomah an va feh a; amiruokchu, lekhabu zuol chu lekha- ziektu Elisama pindana khan an mâksan a; chuongchun, lal na hrieta chun thuhai po po chu an hril tah a."
"So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.","Chuongchun, lal chun Jehudi chu lekhabu zuol chu hung la dingin a tir a; ama chun lekhaziektu Elisama pindana inthawk chun a lâk suok a. Jehudi chun lal na hrieta le, a sîra ngîrhai lalhai po po na hrieta chun a tiem tah a."
Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.,"Thla kuona a na, lal chu thlasik ina chun a ṭhung a, a hmaa chun meithuk a um a. Chun, mei inti hi a um a."
"And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.","Chun, Jehudi chun phêk thum amanih, phêk li amanih a tiem phing chun lal chun chemtê hin a ât thlâk a, meithuka meiin lekhabu zuol chu a kâng zo vawng chenin, meithuka meia chun a pei lût pei tah a."
"And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.","Anni chu an ṭi nawh a, an silfênhai khawm an keithlêr bawk nawh a, hieng thuhai hretu lal le a siehlawhai hrim hrim khawm chun."
Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.,"Chu naw khawm Elnathan le Delaia le Gemaria chun lal kuoma chun lekhabu zuol chu raw lo dingin hnina an siem a, nisienlakhawm, anni chu a ngai nawh a."
"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.","Chun, lal chun lal naupa Jerahmeel le, Azriel naupa Seraia le, Abdeel naupa Selemia chu lekhaziek- tu Baruk le zâwlnei Jeremia chu man dingin thu a pêk a; nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun anni chu a thup a."
"Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, Jeremia baua inthawka Barukin thu a ziekhai le, lekhabu zuol chu lal chun a raw zo vawng chun Jeremia kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
"Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.","“Lekhabu zuol dang la nâwk la, Juda ram lal Jehoiakimin a raw tah, lekhabu zuol hmasaa um thu hma- sahai po po kha ziek rawh."
"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?","Chun, Juda ram lal Jehoiakim chungthua chun hieng ang hin hril i tih; ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Babulon lal chu hung a ta, hi ram hi hung sukse ngei a ta, chutaka in- thawk chun ramsa le mihriem khawm sukchavai a tih, tia, ieng- dinga hitaka hi ziek am in nih a?’ tiin, hi lekhabu zuol hi i raw ta chu a na."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.","Chuleiin, Juda ram lal Jehoia- kim chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: David lalṭhungpha chunga ṭhung ding tukhawm nei naw nih a; chun, a taksa thi chu sûnah lumah, zânah zildeiah peihâwn nîng a tih."
"And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.","Chun, ama le a thla le sie- hlawhai chu an suolna leiin hrem ka ta, chun, an chunga le, Jerusalem hluotuhai chunga le, Juda rama mihai chunga chun, an chunga tlung dinga ka hril, thil ṭha nawhai po po kha intlungtir ka tih; nisienla- khawm, an la ngai naw rawp a,” tiin."
"Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.","Chun, Jeremia chun lekhabu zuol dang chu a lâk a, Neria naupa Baruk, lekhaziektu kuoma chun a pêk tah a; ama chun Juda ram lal Jehoiakimin a lo raw tah lekhabua thuhai po po chu Jeremia baua inthawk chun a ziek tah a; chu naw khawm chu thu angkhat tamtakhai chu an kuoma belsain a um a."
"And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.","Chun, Jehoiakim naupa Konia aia Babulon lal Nebukadnez- zarin Juda ram lala a lo siem Josia naupa Zedekia chun ro a rêl tah a."
"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.","Nisienlakhawm, amain amanih, a siehlawhaiin amanih, chu rama mipuihai chun amani khawm, zâwl- nei Jeremia hmanga a hril LALPA thuhai chu an ngai nawh a."
"And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun Selemaia naupa Jehukal le, thiempu Maaseia naupa Zephania chu zâwlnei Jeremia kuomah, “Tuhin keini ta dingin, LALPA kan Pathien kuoma chun ṭawngṭai rawh”, ti dingin a tir tah a."
Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.,"Chuonglai chun Jeremia chu lung ina an sie ta naw leiin, mipuihai lai chun a lûtin a suok hlak a."
"And Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that were besieging Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem.","Aigupta rama inthawk chun Pharao sipaihai chu an hung a; chun, Jerusalem inhuoltu Kaldaihai chun anni chanchin chu an lo hriet phing chun, Jerusalema inthawk chun an indar tah a."
"Then came the word of Jehovah unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,","Chuongchun, LALPA thu chu zâwlnei Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung a;"
"Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.","“LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ka kuoma thu indawn dinga nang ka kuoma tirtu che, Juda ram lal kuoma chun hieng hin hril rawh: Ngai ta, Pharao sipaihai nang- ma ṭhangpui dinga hunghai chu, an ramah Aiguptaa bawk chun kîr nâwk an tih."
"And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.","Chuongchun, Kaldaihai hung nâwk an ta, hi khawpui hi hung do an ta, lâng an ta, meiin râwng an tih."
"Thus saith Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Kaldaihai chun mi mâksan ta ngei an tih,’ tiin nang le nang inhlêm naw rawh; an fe hmang âwm si nawh a."
"For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.","Nangma hung dotu che Kaldai sipaihai po po khawm chu lo that ta la khawm, anni laia chun mi hliemhai chau chu la umin, chuong khawm chun, mi tin chu mâni puon inhaia chun tho an ta, hi khawpui hi meiin râwng an tih,” tiin."
"And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,","Chun, Pharao sipaihai ṭi leia Kaldai sipaihai chu Jerusalema in- thawka an indar hnung chun,"
"then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.","Jeremia chu Benjamin ramah va fea, chu hnam laia a chanvo chu la dingin, Jerusalema inthawk chun a suok tah a."
"And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou art falling away to the Chaldeans.","Ama chu Benjamin dai kawt- khâra a um lai chun, vêngtu sipai hotu chutaka chun a lo um a, a hming chu Hanania naupa Selemia naupa Irija a nih; ama chun, “Kaldaihai kuomah în pe a nih,” tiin zâwlnei Jeremia chu a man tah a."
"Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.","Jeremia chun, “Thukhêl a nih; Kaldaihai kuomah kân pêk nawh,” a ta; nisienlakhawm, ama chun a ngai nawh a; chuongchun, Irija chun Jeremia chu a man a, rorêltuhai kuoma chun a hung ṭhuoi tah a."
"And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.","Chun, rorêltuhai chu Jeremia chunga chun an lunginsen a, ama chu an hrem a, lekhaziektu Jonathan ina chun lung inah an khum tah a; chu chu lung inah an siem ta sih a."
"When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;","Jeremia chu khur thima le kul- bîngahai chun a hung chun, chutaka chun Jeremia chu ni tamtak a um a;"
"then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.","chun, lal Zedekia chun mi a tir a, a hung ṭhuoi a, a ina chun lal chun a rûkin ân dawn a, a kuomah, “LAL- PA kuoma inthawkin thu a um?” a tih a. Chun, Jeremia chun “A um”, a tih a. “Babulon lal kutah pêkin i um ding a nih,” a ti bawk a."
"Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?","Chu nawa khawm lal Zedekia kuomah Jeremia chun, “Nanga chunga amanih, i siehlawhai chunga amanih, hi hnam chunga hin amanih khaw lai am ka suksuola lung ina i mi khum a na?"
"Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?","I zâwlneihai, ‘Babulon lal chun hi ram amanih, nang amani khawm hung do naw ni,’ tituhai kha khaw lai am an um a?"
"And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.","Chun, tuhin lo hre ta, aw ka pu lal, ka hni che, ka hnina hi, ka ngên che, i hmaa hin pawm ni raw se: lekhaziektu Jonathan ina khan mîn kîr tir nâwk ta naw rawh, chuong naw chun thi rawi ka tih,” a ta."
"Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun thu a pêk a; Jeremia chu vêngtuhai kula chun an sieh a, khawpui sûnga bei po po chu hmang vawng a ni chenin bei siemtuhai kawtthlêra inthawkin ni tin bei an pêk a. Chuongchun, Jere- mia chu vêngtuhai kula chun a um zing tah a."
"And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying,","Chun, Mattan naupa Sephatia le, Pas-hur naupa Gedalia le, Selemia naupa Jukal le, Malkija naupa Pas-hur chun mipuihai po po kuoma Jeremiain hienga a hril hi an lo hriet a,"
"Thus saith Jehovah, He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live.","“Lalpa chun hieng hin a tih: Khawpui sûnga umhai chu kâwl- hnâm le ṭâm le, hripuiin thîng an ta; Kaldaihai kuoma va fe chu hring an tih; a hringna chu insanhim a ta, hring a tih,"
"Thus saith Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi khawpui hi Babulon lal sipaihai kuta pêk ngei ding a na, ama chun lâng a tih,” tiin."
"Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.","Chun, rorêltuhai chun lal kuoma chun, “Kan hni che hi, hi mipa hi sukhlum ni ngei raw se; chuong thuhai chu an kuoma hrilin, mipui po pohai kuthai, hi khawpuia indomi umhai kuthai chu a sukzuoi a nih; hi mipa hin hi hnam ṭhatna ding hi a zawng nawh a, sietna ding a zawng lem a nih”, an ta."
"And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun, “Ngai ta u, in kuta um a nih annâwm,; lal chu nangni kal zâwnga thil thaw thei mi ding a ni si nawh a,” a ta."
"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.","Chuongchun, Jeremia chu an man a, lal naupa Malkija khurthim, vêngtuhai kul sûnga uma chun an sie lût tah a; chuongchun, Jeremia chu khuopnahai le chun an infe thlâktir tah a. Chun, chu khurthim sûnga chun chirhak ti chau naw chu tui khawm a um nawh a, chuongchun, Jeremia chu chirhaka chun ân chie tah a."
"Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),","Chun, Ethiopia mi, Ebed-melek, mi tillâk, lal ina um chun Jeremia chu khurthim sûnga chun an sie ti a hriet chun chu lai chun lal chu Benjamin dai kawtkhâra khan a ṭhung a."
"Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,","Ebed-melek chu lal ina inthawk chun a suok a, lal kuoma chun thu a hang hril tah a:"
"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.","“Ka lalpa, lal, hieng mihai hin zâwlnei Jeremia chunga an thil- thawhai po poa hin thil ṭha naw an thaw a nih, ama chu khurthima chun an peilût a; chutaka chun ama chu phîngṭâma thi el âwm a nih; khawpui sûnga hin bei dang hrim a um ta naw leiin,” a ta."
"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.","Chun, lal chun Ethiopia mi Ebed-melek chu thu a pêk a, “Hitaka inthawkin mi pathum ṭhuoi la, zâwl- nei Jeremia chu a thi hmain khur- thima inthawk chu va la suok ro,” a ta."
"So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.","Chuongchun, Ebed-melek chun mihai chu a ṭhuoi a, lal ina ro ina chun a va feh a, chutaka inthawk chun sahmul puon ṭawphai le, savun puon hluihai chu a lâk a, hruiin Jeremia kuomah khurthim a chun ân khaithlâktir tah a."
"And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.","Chun, Ethiopia mi Ebed-melek chun Jeremia kuoma chun, “Tuhin hieng sahmul puon ṭawphai le, savun puon hluihai hi i zakhnuoiah hrui- hruolahai hnuoia khan sil rawh,” a ta. Jeremia chun chuong ang tak chun a thawh a."
"So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.","Chuongchun, Jeremia chu hrui- hruol chun an khai a, khurthima inthawk chun an lâk suok tah a; chun, Jeremia chu vêngtuhai kul- bînga chun a um zing a."
"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun mi a tir a, LALPA ina um lûtna pathumnaa khan a kuomah zâwlnei Jeremia chu a ṭhuoi tah a; chun, lal chun Jeremia kuoma chun, “Thil pakhat indawn ka ti cheh a, ka kuomah iengkhawm ip naw rawh,” a ta."
"Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.","Jeremia chun Zedekia kuoma chun, “Ka hrilfie chun i mi that ngei naw ding am a nih? thurâwn pe lang che khawm nang chun mi ngai bawk naw ti ni,” a ta."
"So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.","Chuongchun, lal Zedekia chun inrûkin Jeremia kuoma chun ân tiemkam tah a, “LALPA ei hring- nahai siemtu chu a hring zing angin, sukhlum naw ning cheh a, hieng i hringna zawngtuhai kuoma hin pe bawk naw ning che,” a ta."
"Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.","Chun, Jeremia chun Zedekia kuoma chun, “Sipaihai Pathien, Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; Babulon lal rorêltuhai kuomah în pêk chun, i hringna chu hlain um a ta, hi khawpui khawm hi meiin kâng naw ni; nang chu hring i ta, i sûnghai leh;"
"But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.","amiruokchu, Babulon lal rorêl- tuhai kuomah în pêk naw chun hi khawpui hi Kaldaihai kuta chun pêk nîng a ta, meiin râwng an ta, an kuta inthawk chun nang khawm suok- thleng naw ti ni,” a ta."
"And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun, Jeremia kuoma chun “Juda mihai Kaldaihai tienga va kawp tahai kha ka ṭi a nih; an kuta khan mi pe hlau an ta, mi nuisan rawi an tih,” a ta."
"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.","Nisienlakhawm, Jeremia chun, “Nang chu pe suok naw ni hai che.

"But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:","Amiruokchu, vân pêk chu i nuom naw chun, hi hi a nih LALPAIN thu a mîn entir chu."
"Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: now that thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.","Ngai ta, Juda ram lal ina nu- hmei mâksana umhai po po kha Babulon lal rorêltuhai kuoma hung ṭhuoi suok nîng an ta; chuong nuhmeihai chun, ‘I ruol hmêlhriet- takhai chun an hlêm cheh a, an hne ta che a ni hi; tuhin i kehai chu chirhaka chun a tluma, an hnungkîr nâwk a ni ta hi,’ tîng an ta."
"And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.","Chun, i nauhai le i nuhmeihai po po chu Kaldaihai kuoma chun hung la suok an ta, nang khawm an kuta inthawk chun suokthleng naw ti ni: amiruokchu, Babulona lal kuta man nîng i ta; hi khawpui hi meia raw dingin siem i tih,” a ta."
"Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.","Chun, Zedekia chun Jeremia kuomah, “Hieng thuhai hi tukhawm inhriettir naw la, thi naw ti ni."
"But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:","Nisienlakhawm, rorêltuhai chun kân biekpui che ti an hrieta, i kuomah an hunga, i kuomah, ‘Lal kuoma i thu hril kha mi hrilfie rawh, kan kuomah ip naw la, sukhlum naw ning ung che; chun, ieng am lal chun i kuomah a hril a an ti chun,’"
"then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.","an kuoma chun, ‘Jonathan ina thi el dinga min kîrtir nâwk lo dingin, lal chu ka hnina ka pêk a nih’, tîng i ta,” tiin."
"Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.","Chuongchun, rorêltuhai po po chu Jeremia kuoma chun an hung a, an indwn ta ngei a, ama chun lalin thu a pêk ang tak pei chun a hril tah a. Chuongchun, ama le inbiek chu an mah a, a thu tak chu hril a ni si nawh a."
So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken,"Chuongchun, Jeremia chu vêng- tuhai kulbînga chun Jerusalem chu lâka a um ni chen chun a um tah a."
"(in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;","Juda ram lal Zedekia inlal kum kuona, thla sâwmnaa chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chu a sipaihai po po leh Jerusalemah a hung a, a hung rûn tah a;"
"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),","chun, Zedekia inlal kum sâwm- pakhatna, thla lina, chu thla ni kuo ni chun chu khawpuia chun suksietna chu a um tah a."
"that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, to wit, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.","Jerusalem lâk a ni ni chun, Babulon lal rorêltuhai po po chu an hung lût a, dai kawtkhâr lailung, Nergal-sarezera dâm, Samgar-neboa dâm, Sarsekima dâm, Rabsarisa dâm, Rabmaga dâm, Babulon lal rorêltu dang po pohai le chun an ṭhung tâwl a."
"And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.","Chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia le indo mihai po po chun chu chu an hmu chun an tlânseh a, kul pahni inkâra dai kawtkhârah, lal huon lampuia chun a zân a zân chun an tlânsuok tah a; chuongchun, ama chu Araba lampuia khan a feh a."
"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.","Nisienlakhawm, Kaldai sipaihai chun anni chu an hnawt a, Zedekia chu Jeriko phairuoma chun an hnawt phâk a, chun, ama chu an man chun, Hamath rama Riblaa Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a, ama chun a chungah ro a rêlthlûk a."
Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.,"Riblaa chun a mithmu ngeiah Nebukadnezzar chun Zedekia naupa- salhai chu a that a; chun, Babulon lal chun Juda mi ṭhahai po po khawm chu a that bawk a."
"Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.","Chu nawa khawm chun, Zedekia mithai chu a kheldawk a, thîrkawl ân buntir a, Babulona ṭhuoi ding- in."
"And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.","Chun, Kaldaihai chun lal in le mihai inhai chu meiin an rawh a, Jerusalem kulbanghai chu an sukchim tah a."
"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.","Chun, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun khawpuia mi la um sunhai le, tlân hmangtuhai le, ama kuoma hung lûthai le, mipui a la mahla la um sunhai po chu Babulon tieng chun salah a ṭhuoi tah a."
"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.","Nisienlakhawm, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun mi rimsihai iengkhawm nei lohai chu Juda rama chun a mâksan a, grêp huonhai le lohai anni chu a pêk nghâl tâwl bawk a."
"Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,","Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chun Jeremia chu Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu, kuoma chun enkawl dingin a pêk a,"
"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.","“Ṭhuoi la, ama hi ṭhatakin enkawl la, sukpawi naw rawh; ami- ruokchu, i kuoma a hril ang ang chun thawpêk lem rawh,” a ta."
"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;","Chuongchun, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu le Nebusazban, Rabsaris, Nergal-sarezer, Rabmag le Babulon lal rorêltuhai po po chun,"
"they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he dwelt among the people.","mi an tir a, Jeremia chu vêng- tuhai kulbînga inthawk chun an ṭhuoi suok a, Saphan naupa Ahikam, chu naupa Gedalia kuoma chun an pêk a, in tienga ṭhuoi dingin; chuong- chun, mipuihai laia chun a um ve tah a."
"Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a, vêngtuhai kulbînga khum a ni lai khan,"
"Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.","“Fe la, Ethiopia mi Ebed-melek kuoma khan hieng hin va hril rawh, Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, thil ṭha tiengah ni lovin, thil ṭha naw tiengah hi khawpui chunga hin ka thuhai chu ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; chun, chu nia chun nanga hmaa chun suk- kim nîng an tih."
"But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, nang chu, chu ni chun sansuok ka ti cheh a, mi iṭihai kuta chun pêk ni naw ti ni, LALPA chun a tih."
"For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.","Sandam ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, kâwlhnâmah i tlu naw ding a ni sih a; amiruokchu, i hringna chu nangma ta dinga sanhim nîng a tih; i ringna chu keimaa hin i sie leiin, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
"If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, if thou wilt return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight; then shalt thou not be removed;","“Aw Israel, i hung kîr chun, LALPA Pathien chun a tih: ka kuomah i hung kîr ding a nih; i tirdakumnahai chu ka mithmua inthawka i sie hmang chun nang chu sukchângin um naw ti nih;"
"and thou shalt swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.","chuongchun, nang chun, ‘LALPA chu a hring zing angin, thudikah, rorêlnaah, felnaah, hnamhai chu amaa chun engthâwl an ta, amaa chun chawimawiin um an tih,’ tiin ṭawng inkhâm i ta.”"
"For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.","Jerusalema le Juda rama mihai kuoma chun, LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: In hnuoi inlet lo chu suknawi unla, hling lai chun chi thlâk naw ro."
"Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.","LALPA kuoma chun ser intan unla, in lungril ser chu tan ro, nangni Jerusalema mihai le, Juda rama mi- hai; chuong naw chun ka lunginsenna chu mei angin fe suok a ta, i thilthaw- hai rîtlona lei chun; tukhawm iṭhel ruol loin kâng a tih."
"Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.","Juda rama chun hrilfie unla, Jerusalema chun phuong ro, “Rama chun tawtawrâwt chu mût unla, khêk inring unla, hieng hin ti ro: Hung inkhâwm tâwl unla, khawpui kul- neiahai chun fêng ei tiu,” tiin."
"Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.","Zion tienga chun puonzâr chu khai unla, himna dingin tlânhmang unla, muong naw ro; hmar tienga inthawkin thil ṭha naw sietna nasa- tak chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a."
"A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.","Sakeibaknei chu a chîmbuka in- thawk chun a hung suok tah a, hnam- hai sukbohmangtu ding chu; a lam- puia chun a thang mêk a, a hmuna inthawk chun a suok tah a, i ram chu râusana siem ding le, i khawpuihai khawm hluotuhai um loa sukse dingin."
"For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.","Hi hi lei hin saiip puon dierkei unla, sûn unla, ṭap inrûm ro; LALPA lunginsenna ṭium chu einia inthawk- in a hnungkîr si nawh a."
"And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.","Chuong nia chun LALPA chun a tih: Lal lungril chu bohmang a ta, rorêltuhai le thiempuhai lungril chun maktîng a tih; zâwlneihai khawma maktîng an tih."
"Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the life.","Chun, kei chun, “E, Lalpa PATHIEN!

"At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;","Chu huna chun chu hnam le Jerusalem kuoma chun, “Thlalêra bâwlhmunhaia inthawkin ka mihai naunuhai tienga chun thli lum tak, mûtdeina ding ni si lo, sukfai ding khawm ni lo;"

"Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles.

"The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.","Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotuin ama chu Ramaa in- thawka ân fetir a, Juda rama mi le Jerusalema sal intânghai Babulon tienga sala ṭhuoihai laia khaidieta khuopa ama a ṭhuoi hnunga LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chu."

"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.","Tuhin, ngai ta, vawisûn ni hin i kuta khaidiet umhaia inthawk chun kân suo che a nih.

"Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, said he, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.","Chun, chuonga a la fe hma chun, ama chun, “Fe el rawh; Babulon lal Juda ram khawpuihai chunga rorêl- tua a siem Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma chun kîr nâwk la, mipuihai lai chun ama kuoma chun va um el rawh; annawleh, fena dinga remchâng i tina tieng tieng chun fe el rawh,” a ta.

"Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;","Chun, rama sipai hotuhai po po le an mihaiin Babulon lalin Gedalia Ahikam naupa chu chu rama rorêl- tuah a siem a, a kuoma chun pasal- hai, nuhmeihai, naupanghai, mi rimsitak takhai, Babulona sala ṭhuoia um nawhai chu ân kawltir ti an hriet chun,"
"then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, to wit, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.","Mizpaa Gedalia kuoma chun, Nethania naupa Ismael, Karea nau- pasal Johanan le Jonathan, Tanhu- meth naupa Seraia, Netophath mi Ephai naupasalhai, Maakath mi naupa Jezania le anni le an mihai chu an hung tâwl a."
"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.","Chun, Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia chun inkhâmin, anni le an mihai kuoma chun a hril a, “Kaldaihai hi an rawng bâwlpêk chu ṭi naw ro; rama chun chêng unla, Babulon lal rawng chu bâwl unla, in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih."
"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.","Keia chungthua chun, ngai ta u, eini kuoma hunghai, Kaldaihai hmaa ngîr dingin Mizpaa hin ka chêng ding a na; amiruokchu, nangni chun uoin le nipui theirahai chu la khâwm unla, hriek leh, in bâwmahai chun sie unla, khawpui in lâk tahaia chun chêng el ro,” tiin."
"Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;","Chuong ang bawk chun Moab rama Juda chênghai po po le, Ammon thlahai laia chêng le, Edoma mihai le, ram po poa chênghai chun, Babulon lal chun hlâbîk Juda rama chun mâksan a la nei a, Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia chu an chunga chun a sie ti an hriet chun,"
"then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.","Judahai po po chu hnawthmang an nina hmun senga inthawk chun an hung kîr a, Juda ramah, Mizpaa Gedalia kuoma chun an hung a, uoin le nipui thei rahai chu tamtak el chu an lâk khâwm tah a."
"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,","Chu nawa khawm Karea naupa Johanan le sipaihai hotuhai ram- hnuoia umhai po po chu Mizpaa chun Gedalia kuoma chun an hung a,"
"and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.","a kuomah, “Ammon thlahai lal Baalis chun Nethania naupa Ismael chu i hringna la dingin a hung tir ti i hriet am?” an tih a. Nisienlakhawm, Gedalia, Ahikam naupa chun anni chu a taksâwn nawh a."
"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?","Chun, Karea naupa Johanan chun Mizpaa Gedalia kuoma chun inrûkin thu a hril a, “Mi tir la, ka ngên che hi, Nethania naupa Ismael chu that el ka tih; tukhawma hre hliek naw ni hai; ieng dingin am i hringna chu lain, Juda i kuoma hung inkhâwm sunhai chu sukdara umin, Juda rama la um sunhai chu bohmang el an ta?” a ta."
"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.","Nisienlakhawm, Ahikam naupa Gedalia chun Karea naupa Johanan kuoma chun, “Hi thil hi i thaw ding a ni nawh, Ismael chungthuah khêl dêr i hril a ni sih a,” a ta."
"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.","Chun, thla sarinaa chun lal chi Elisama naupa Nethania, chu naupa Ismael le, lal hotu lientak pakhat le, ama kuoma mi sâwmhai le chun, Mizpaa chun Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma chun an hung tah a; chutaka Mizpaa chun bei dâm an fâk hmunkhat tâwl a."
"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.","Chun, Nethania naupa Ismael le a kuoma mi sâwm umhai chu an tho a, Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia, Babulon lalin chu rama rorêltu dinga a sie chu kâwlhnâm leh an thawh a, ama chu an that tah a."
"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, to wit, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.","Ismael chun Gedalia kuoma Juda umhai po po Mizpaa umhai le, Kaldai mi, chutaka um, indo mihai khawm chu a that vawng a."
"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,","Chun, Gedalia chu a thata mi tukhawma an hriet naw ni hnina hnunga chun hieng hi a hung na;"
"that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.","Mi ṭhenkhat Sekema inthawk dâm, Siloa inthawk dâm, Samaria inthawk dâmin mi sâwmriet zet, an khâkhmul vawa, an puonhai kei- thlêra, anni le anni chu inât a, an kuta bu thilinhlânhai le rimin- hnikhai chawiin, LALPA ina hung inhlân dingin an hung tah a."
"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.","Chun, Nethania naupa Ismael chu Mizpaa inthawk chun, a fe malama ṭap pei pumin anni chu tuok dingin a fe suok tah a; chun, anni chu ân tuokpui chun an kuoma chun, “Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuomah hung ro,” a tih a."
"And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.","Chun, chuong ang tak chun a hung na, khawpui sûnga an hung phing chun Nethania naupa Ismael chun anni chu a that tah a, ama le a kuoma mi umhai chun anni chu khur sûnga chun an pei thlâk tah a."
"But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.","Chun, anni laia chun mi sâwm Ismael kuoma, “Keini chu mi that naw rawh; rama chun bu dâm, buṭei dâm, hriek dâm, khuoizu dâm thup- hmangna khur chu kan nei sih a,” tituhai chu an um a. Chuongchun, anni chu a hla tah a, an unauhai laia chun a that ve ta nawh a."
"Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.","Chun, chu khur, Ismaelin Geda- lia sîra mi a thathai ruong po po a pei thlâkna chu (chu chu Israel lal Baasa a ṭi leia lal Asain a lo siem kha a nih) Nethania naupa Ismael chun chu chu mi thathai chun a suksip tah a."
"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.","Chun, Ismael chun Mizpaa mi la chuonghai po po, lal naunuhmeihai le, Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma Nebuzaradanin ân kawltir Mizpaa la umhai po po chu salah a ṭhuoi hmang tah a; Nethania naupa Ismael chun anni chu salah a ṭhuoi a, Ammon thlahai chu fethlengpui dingin a fe suok tah a."
"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,","Nisienlakhawm, Karea naupa Johanan le, ama kuoma um sipai hotuhai po po chun Nethania naupa Ismaelin thil ṭha naw a thawhai po po chu an lo hriet chun,"
"then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.","mi po po chu an ṭhuoi a, Nethania naupa Ismael chu do dingin an fe suok tah a; ama chu Gibeona tuipuihai kâwla chun an va hmuh a."
"Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.","Chun, Ismael kuoma mipui um po pohai chun Karea naupa Johanan le sipai hotuhai po po le a kuoma umhai po po chu an hmu chun an lâwm ta êm êm el a."
"So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.","Chuongchun, Mizpaa inthawka Ismael sal intâng dinga a ṭhuoihai po po chu an inlêt a, an hung kîr a, Karea naupa Johanan kuoma chun an fe tâwl tah a."
"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.","Amiruokchu, Nethania naupa Ismael chu mi pariet leh Johanana inthawk chun a suokthleng a, Am- mon thlahai kuoma chun a fe tah a."
"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to wit, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.","Chun, Karea naupa Johanan le, a kuoma sipai hotu umhai po po chun, Nethania naupa Ismaela inthawka mipui la um sun an lâk dawkhai po po chu, Ahikam naupa Gedalia le, indo mihai, nuhmeihai, naupanghai le, mitillâkhai, Gibeona inthawka a hung ṭhuoi nâwkhai a that hnunga, a lâk suokhai chu Mizpaa inthawk chun an ṭhuoi tah a."

"and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be presented before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, even for all this remnant (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us),","zâwlnei Jeremia kuoma chun hieng hin an hril a, “Kan ngên che hi, kan hninahai hi i hmaa chun pawm ni raw se; hieng tuta la mahlahai po po ta ding hin, LALPA i Pathien kuoma chun kan ta dingin ṭawngṭai rawh; i mitin a hmu chie ang hin, tamtak kha tlâwmte chau hi hlain kan um a nih;"
"that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.","LALPA i Pathien chun thil kan thaw ding le, lampui kan hraw ding chu a mîn hriettir theina dingin,” tiin."
"Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.","Chun, zâwlnei Jeremia chun an kuomah, “In thu chu ka hriet tah a; ngai ta u, LALPA in Pathien kuoma chun in thuhai ang peiin ṭawngṭai ka tih; chun, thil iengkhawma LALPAIN a hung dawnna cheu chu in kuomah hrilfieng ka tih, iengkhawm in kuomah ip naw ning,” a ta."
"Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.","Anni chun Jeremia kuoma chu, “LALPA i Pathienin kan kuoma a hung tirna ang thu po pohai anga kan thaw naw chun, LALPA chu eini laia hrietpuitu ringum le indik ni raw se."

"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.","Chun, ni sâwm hnunga chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a."
"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,","Ama chun Karea naupa Johanan le, an kuoma um sipai hotuhai po po le, mi po po a chîn taka inthawka a lien tak chenin a ko a."

"And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,","Chun, hieng thuhai po po, LALPA an Pathienin an kuom- a ama a tirna, LALPA an Pathien thuhai po po chu mipuihai po po kuoma Jeremia chun a hril zo chun,"

"And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.","Ama chu hung a ta, Aigupta rama chu hung hrem a ta, thinaa pêk dinghai chu thinaah, sala intâng dinghai chu salah, kâwlhnâma ding- hai chu kâwlhnâm kuoma pêk nîng an tih."
"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.","Chun, Aigupta pathienhai ina chun mei sêm a ta; ama chun râwng a ta, salah ṭhuoi hmang a tih; berâmpu chu ama silfêna ân chei angin, ama chu Aigupta ram chun inchei a tih; chutaka inthawk chun thlamuong- takin fe suok tâng a tih."

"Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.","Zingkâra tho a, anni hung tirin, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai po po, ‘Aw hi thil tirdakum ka theida hi chu thaw naw ro,’ tiin in kuomah ka hung tir a."

"Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, mi an nuhmeihaiin pathien danghai kuomah riminhnik an raw ti hretuhai po po le, nuhmei lo ngîr vehai po po le, inkhâwm nasa- takhai, Pathrosa Aigupta rama mi chêng po pohai chun Jeremia chu an dawn a,"

"The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!","Babulona inthawka ṭap ri le, Kaldaihai rama suksietna nasatak chu e!"
"For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:","LALPA chun Babulon chu a suk- siet a, amaa inthawka râwl ropuitak chu a sukbohmang tah a; chun, an chângvêl chu tui tamtakhai angin an inrih a, an râwl rihai chu insuoin a um a;"
"for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.","ama chunga chun suksetu chu a hung ta sih a, Babulon chung ngeia chun; a mi thilthawtheihai chu manin an um a, an thalngulhai khawm chu a tliek innawi vawng a; LALPA chu phuba latu Pathien a ni sih a, ama chun thung ngei ngei a tih."
"And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, a lalhai le a mi varhai le, a rorêltuhai le, a lal aiawtuhai le a mi thilthawtheihai chu sukrui ka ta; kumkhuoa innaa chun in an ta, tho ta naw ni hai, Laltak, a hming khawm sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.","Babulon kulbang lientakhai khawm chu sukchim nîng an ta, a dai kawtkhârhai chu meia raw nîng an ta, a mipuihai chu a thlâwn elin inrim an ta, hnamhai khawm chu mei leiin inrim an ta, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih” tiin."
"The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.","A rorêl a kum li kuma, Juda lal Zedekia le Babulona an hang fe laia, Maaseia naupa Neria, chu naupa Seraia kuoma zâwlnei Jeremia thupêk thuhai chu. Tun Seraia chu khawtlâng hotu lien tak a na."
"And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.","Chun, Jeremia chun Babulon chunga thil ṭha naw hung tlung ding- hai po po, Babulon chungchângthua thu zieka umhai po po chu, lekhabua chun a ziek a."
"And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words,","Chun, Jeremia chun Seraia kuoma chun, “Babulona i va fe pha chun, hieng thuhai po po hi en la, tiem la,"
"and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.","‘Aw LALPA, nang chun hi hmun chungchâng thua hin, sât thlâk ding a nizie dâm, tukhawm an chêng naw dingzie dâm, mihriem amanih, ramsa amani khawm an chêng naw dingzie le, kumkhuoa râusan a ni dingzie chu i lo hril tah a,’ ti la."
"And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:","Chun, hi lekhabu hi i tiem zo pha pha chun, lung leh khit dêng i ta, Euphrates vadunga chun va pei lût i tih;"
"and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.","chun, ‘Hieng ang bawk hin Babulon chu tlumhmang a ta, a chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung in- tlungtir dinghai lei chun tho nâwk ta ngai naw nih a, rimsi hle tâng an tih,’ ti rawh,” a ta. Jeremia thuhai chu chu chen chu a nih."
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.,"Zedekia chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pakhat mi a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpakhat sûng ro a rêl a; a nu hming chu, Libnaa Jeremia naunu Hamutal a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.","Chun, ama chun LALPA mit- hmua thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a, Jehoiakimin a thaw ang chie el kha."
"For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.",LALPA lunginsenna leia anni chu Juda le Jerusalema a hmaihmaa inthawka anni a pei suok hmakhat chun Zedekia chu Babulon lal chungah a hel zing a.
"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.","Chun, a rorêl kum kuona, thla sâwmnaa, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar le, a si- paihai po po chu Jerusalem do ding chun an hung a, an umngha tah a; a vêl ela chun kulhai an bâwl khum tah a."
So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.,"Chuongchun, khawpui chu lal Zedekia inlal kum sâwm pakhatna chen inhuolin a um a."
"In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.","A thla linaa, chu thla ni kuo ni chun khawpui sûnga ṭâmna chu a nasa ta êm êm a; chu rama mipuihai ta ding chun bei hrim a um ta nawh a."
"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and they went toward the Arabah.","Chun, khawpuia chun lamrel siem a ni tah a, lal huon sîra, bang pahnihai inkâra dai kawtkhâr lam- puia chun zânah indo mihai po po chu an tlân suok tah a (chuongchun, Kal- daihai chun khawpui chu a vêlin an umngha a na) Araba tieng lampuia chun an fe tah a."
"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.","Nisienlakhawm, Kaldai sipaihai chun lal chu an hnawt tah a, Jeriko phairuoma chun Zedekia chu an va hnawt phâk tah a; chuongchun, a sipaihai po po chun ama chu an indar san tah a."
"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.","Chun, lal chu an man a, Hamath rama Riblaa chun Babulon lal kuoma chun an ṭhuoi tah a; chun, ama chun a chungthu a lo rêlthlûk tah a."
And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.,"Chun, Babulon lal chun a mit- hmu ngeia chun Zedekia naupasalhai chu a that tah a; chun, Riblaa chun Juda ram lalhai po po chu a that vawng bawk a."
"And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.","Chun, Zedekia mithai chu a kheldawkpêk a, Babulon lal chun ama chu thîrkawl ân buntir a, Babu- lon tieng a ṭhuoi a, a thi ni chenin lung inah a sie tah a."
"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem.","Chun, thla nganaa, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun, chu chu Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwm- pakuona a nih; vêngtu hotu Nebuza- radan lal hmaa ngîr hlak chu Jerusalema chun a hung a,"
"And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.","LALPA in le lal in chu a rawh a; Jerusalema in po pohai, in ropui takhai khawm chu meiin a raw tah a."
"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.","Chun, Kaldai sipaihai vêngtu pâwlhai la umhai po po chun Jerusalem kulbang chu a vêlin an sukchim tah a."
"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.","Chuongchun, vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebuzaradan chun, mi rimsihai pâwl le, khawpuia a mahlaa mâksana la um pâwlhai le, hung inrelruhai, Babulon lal kuoma hung tlân lûthai le, mipui la um sunhai hrim hrim chu sal dingin a ṭhuoi tâwl a."
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.,"Nisienlakhawm, Nebuzaradan chun chu rama mi inrim zuol taluohai chu lo neitu dinghaia le, grêp huon enkawltu dinghaiah a mâksan a."
"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.","Chun, LALPA ina dârsen sût- puihai, dârsen maihûn le ân ṭhut- nahai LALPA ina umhai chu Kaldaihai chun an suknawi vawng a, a dârsenhai po po chu Babulon tieng chun an phur tah a."
"The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.","Chun, bêlhai, vutluohai, mei chepnahai, maihûnhai, thîrhaihaw- hai, bûr le bêl dârsena siemhai po po rawngbâwlnaa an hmang hlakhai chu an lâk hmang vawng a."
"And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls—that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,—the captain of the guard took away.","Chun, nohai, vutluohai, mai- hûnhai, bêlhai, chawtawlhai, rângka- chaka siemhai chu rângkachakin tangkaruoa siemhai chu tangka- ruoin, vengtu pâwl sipai hotu chun a lâk vawng a."
"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah—the brass of all these vessels was without weight.","Sûtpui pahnihai, chawtawl pakhat, ân ṭhutna hnuoia dârsen bâwngchal sâwm le pahni LALPA in ta dinga lal Solomonin a siemhai chu: hieng bûr le bêl dârsenhai po po hi a bûk chin hrietlo an nih."
"And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.","Sûtpui chungthua chun, sûtpui pakhat seizie chu tawng sâwmpariet a nih; chun, tawng sâwmpahni vêl- tuok a nih; chu chu sazie chu kut bel li bawk a na, kawrawng a nih."
"And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates.","Chun, a chunga chun dâra siem a lubâwk a um a, a lubâwk pakhat insângzie chu tawng nga a na, a vêl chun lênkal le, theibufai chu a lubâwk chunga dârsena siem vawng a um a, chun, sûtpui pahnina khawm chun chuong ang bawk chu, theibu- faihai le chun a ni ve bawk a."

"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun thiempu laltak Seraia le, a dawttu Zephania le, kawtkhâr vêngtu pathum a ṭhuoi a;"
"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king’s face, that were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.","khawpui sûnga inthawk chun indo mihai enkawltu hotu a ṭhuoi bawk a; chun lal hmaa ngîr hlak, chu khawpuia hmua um mi pasari leh; indo mihai hotu ziektu, a ram mihai hming ziektu, le khawpui sûnga mi hmua um chu ram mi sâwmruk leh a ṭhuoi a."
"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.","Chun, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun anni chu a ṭhuoi a, Babulon lal kuomah Riblaa chun a hung ṭhuoi tâwl a."
"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.","Babulon lal chun anni chu a hrem a, Hamath rama Riblaa chun anni chu a that tâwl tah a. Chuong- chun, a rama inthawk chun Juda chu sala intâng dinga ṭhuoi a ni tah a."

in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.,"Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwmhni pathum kum chun Nebuza- radan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun Juda mi sala intâng ding chu za sari, sâwmli panga a ṭhuoi a; chuongchun, mihriem po po chu sâng li le za ruk an nih.Jehoiakin insuoa a um thu le Babulona chawisânga a um thu (2 Lal 25.27-30)"
"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;","Chun, Juda ram lal Jehoiakin sala ân tâng kum sâwmthum pasa- rina, thla sâwm pahnina, chu thla ni sâwmhni panga ni chun Evil- merodak Babulon lal ân lal kum, kum khatnaa chun Juda lal Jehoiakin lu chu a dawm kâng a, lung ina inthawk chun a hung ṭhuoi suok tah a;"
"and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,","a kuoma chun ngilneitakin thu a hril a, a lalṭhungpha chu Babulona lal um mi danghai nêka insânga chun a siepêk a."
and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:,"Chun, a lung in intângna silfênhai chu a thlengpêk a, a kuoma chun ni tinin a dam sûng po chu bu a fâk ve hlak a."
"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.","Chun, a hlaw ding khawm Babulon lal chun a pêk zing a, a dam sûng nihai po poa chun, a thi hma- khat chun ni tin a chanpuol a pêk a."
"Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.","Nangni Benjamin thlahai, Jeru- salem sûnga inthawk chun himna dingin tlânhmang ro; Tekoaa chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, Beth-hake- rema chun inchikna chu khai unla; thil ṭha naw chu, bohmangna le chun, hmâr tienga inthawk chun a hung dâk sih a."
"The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.",Ngainobei le inno Zion naunu chu sât thlâng ka tih.
Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.,"Berâmpuhai chu an ranruolhai leh a kuomah hung an ta; a vêla chun an puon inhai a vêlin kei khum an tih, mi tin chu mâni hmun senga chun fâk zawng an tih."
"Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.","Ama chunga indona ding chu buotsai ro, tho unla, sûn hun laia chun hang thâwng ei tiu.

"Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.","Tho unla, zâna chun hang fêng ei tiu, a in ropuihai chu hang suksieng ei tiu khai."
"For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a lo ti ta sih a: Thinghai chu phûr thlu unla, Jerusalem chunga chun pil dêngpâwnghai chu siem ro, hi hi khawpui hremna ding chu a na, a sûnga chun innêksâwrna ringawt el a nih."
"As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.","Tuisunsuo chun a tuihai a phu- suok angin, a khawhlonahai chu a phusuok a; a sûnga chun inpâwng- nêkna le suksietna hriet a na, ka hmaa chun natna le hliemnahai chu a um zing zing a nih."
"Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.","Aw Jerusalem, inchûktirin in um tah, chuong naw chun, ka thla hin hransan rawi a ti che, chuong naw chun, râusan le ram hluo loah siem ka ti che."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Grêphrui angin Israel la um sunhai chu zenfai vawng an tih, grêp sîktuhai angin i kut chu paikâwnga chun ban nâwk rawh."
"To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.","An hriet theina dingin tu kuom am thuhrilin hrilfieng ka ta?

"Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.","Chuleiin, LALPA lunginsenna chun ka sip a; insûm zing chu ka nghawk a nih; kawtthlêra chun nau- panghai laia chun bunthla la, tlang- vâl inkhâwmhai laia le chun; pasal chu a nuhmei le chun lâk nîng an ta, mi upatak le tartak khawm."
"And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.","Chun, an inhai, an lohai, an nuhmeihai chu mi danghai kuoma pêk nîng an ta; ram hluotuhai chunga chun ka kut kân let ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.,"Anni laia a chîn taka inthawka anni laia a lien tak chenin, inîtthîk tuonain an sip a; zâwlneihaia in- thawka thiempuhai chen khawmin, mi tin el chun indik lotakin an thawh a."

"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.","Thil tirdakumhai an thaw chun an inzapui am?

"Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk therein.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Lampuiahai chun ngîr unla, en ta u, lampui ṭha hluihai chu indawn unla, “lampui ṭha chu khâw lai am a na; chu chu hraw unla, in thlarau ta dingin châwlna hmûng in tih,” tiin;"

"Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.","Chuleiin, hnamhai, lo ngai unla, lo hre ta u, aw inkhâwmhai, anni laia thil um chu."
"Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.","Aw leihnuoi, lo hre ta, ngai ta, ka thuhai chu an ngai naw leiin hi hnam chunga hin thil ṭha naw, an ngaituonahai ra ngei chu kân tlungtir ding a nih; ka dân hlak chu an lo hnâwl a."

"Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.","Lohaia chun fe suok naw unla, lampuia khawm chun fe naw ro; hmêlma kâwlhnâm le ṭitumna chu sîr tin ela chun a um sih a."
"O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.","Aw ka chipui naunu, saiip puonin inbel la, pilvuta chun inbuol rawh; naupasal khât sûn angin sûn la, sûnna natak el chun, ei chunga chun suksetu chu a hung vak ding a ni sih a."

The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.,"Pûmthei chu ṭiumtakin ân thlih a, suon chu mei ikâng hmang chun a um a, a thlâwn elin sukfainaa chun an feh a, mi rilohai chu lâk hmang an ni si nawh a."

For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;,"In lampuihai le in thilthawhai chu in siem ṭha a; mi le a tuolbâwm kara rorêlna tlangtaka in sukthlûk- pêk a,"
"if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:","mikhuolhai chu in nêksâwr nawh a, pa nei lohai le hmeithaihai leh; hi hmuna hin mi thiem thisen chu in insuo naw bawk a, nangni le nangni insukpawina dingin pathien danghai chu in zui bawk naw chun,"
"then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.","in thlatuhai kuoma ram ka i pêk tah, inhmaa inthawka kumkhaw- tluong elin, hi hmuna hin inchêngtir ka ti cheu."
"Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.","Ngai ta u, thukhêlhliphai, ṭhat- hnemna neilohai chu in ring a."
"Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,","Inruin, tuolthatin, uirein, khêla inkhâmin, Baal hmaa chun rimin- hnik rawin pathien in hriet nawhai chu zuiin,"
"and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations?","‘Sansuokin ei um tah’ tiin, hieng thil pawrchehai po po hi thaw dingin hi in ka hming chawisana hin hungin ka hmaa chun in hung ngîr ding am a nih?"
"Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.","Hi in ka hming chawi hi in mit- hmua chun inruhai pûk a lo ni ta a ni maw? Ngai ta u, keiin, keima ngeiin ka hmu tah, LALPA chun a tih."
"But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.","Amiruokchu, tuhin ka hmun Siloa chun fe unla, a tira inthawka ka hming kân umtir zingnaa chun; ka mi Israelhai khawhlona leia thil ka ithawhai chu va hmu ta u."
"And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not:","Chun, tuhin LALPA chun, ‘Hieng thilthawhai po po hi in thaw ta leiin, inhmataka thoa thu hrilin, in kuoma ngei chun thu ka lo hril tah a; nisienlakhawm, in ngai si nawh a; ka ko cheu a, in mi dawn nawh a;"
"therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.","chuleiin, in thlatuhai le nangni kuoma ka pêk, hmun le in ringna innghatna, ka hming chawia ko, in chunga chun, Siloa chunga ka lo thaw ta ang bawk khan ka thaw ding a nih."

"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.","Chuleiin, hi hnam ta ding hin ṭawngṭai naw la, an ta dingin ṭawng- ṭaina amanih, râwl amani khawm insuo naw rawh; chun, ka kuoma khawm hnina khawm hung siem bawk naw rawh; ka lo ngai âwm si naw cheh a."

"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.","Naupanghai chun thing an inkhâwm a, pahai chun mei an sêm a, nuhmeihai chun bei an hmet a; vân lalnu ta dinga beithlum siem dingin le, lunginsennaa an mi chawktho theina dinga pathien danghai kuoma dâwnmi thilinhlânhai dâm chu bur dingin."

"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, ka lungin- senna le ka ṭiumna chu hi hmuna hin bunthlâk nîng a ta, mihriem chunga le, ramsahai chunga le, rama thing- hai chunga le, hnuoia rahai chunga chun; chun, kâng a ta, ṭhel ni ngai naw ni."

"For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:","Inthâwinahai le pumrawhmang thilinhlân chungthua hin Aigupta rama inthawka anni ka hung ṭhuoi suok nia chun, in thlatuhai kuoma chun thu hrilin, thupêk ka lo nei nawh;"

"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.","Nisienlakhawm, an ngai nawh a, an na khawm an sit bawk nawh a, amiruokchu, anni remruotnaa le, an lungril rilo kâwmâwna chu hrawin, hmatiengah ni loin an kîr nâwk ta lem a."
"Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:","In thlatuhai Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok nia inthawka vawisûn ni chen hin ni tin inhmatak- in thoin, ka zâwlneihai ka siehlawhai po po chu an kuomah ka hung tir a;"

And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.,"Chun, hieng thuhai po po hi an kuoma chun i hril ding a nih; ami- ruokchu, i thu chu ngai naw ni hai; anni chu ko bawk i ta, nisienla- khawm, dawn naw ni hai che."
"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “LALPA an Pathien râwl khawm ngai loa, inchûktirna khawm pawm bawk lohai chu hi hnam hi an nih; thudik chu a riral a, an baua inthawk chun sât thlâkin a um a,” tîng i tih."
"Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.","Aw Jerusalem, i sam chu tan rawh, peihâwn la, bâwlhmun tlânga- hai chun sûnna siem rawh; LALPA chun a lunginsenna thlahai chu a nghatsanin a hnâwl ta sih a."
"For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.","Juda thlahai chun ka mithmua thil ṭha naw chu an lo thaw ta sih a, LALPA chun a tih: sukpawrche ding- in, in ka hming chawia koa chun an tirdakumnahai chu an sie tah a."
"And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.","Hinnom naupa ruoma chun Topheth bâwlhmunhai chu an naupa- salhai le an naunuhmeihai meia an rawna dingin an bâwl tah a; chuong chu thu ka pêk ngai nawh a, ka lungrila khawm lût khawm a hung lût ngai nawh."
"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, a nihai a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih; Topheth amanih, Hinnom naupa ruom ama- nih ti ni ta ngai naw nih a, Inthatna ruom ti ni lem tâng a tih, hi Topheth hmuna hin inphûmna hmun ding a um naw chen khawma an inphûm ding a ni sih a."

"At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;","Chu huna chun, LALPA chun a tih: Juda lalhai ruhai, a rorêltu- hai ruhai, thiempuhai ruhai, zâwlnei- hai ruhai, Jerusalem hluotuhai ruhai chu an thlânhaia inthawkin hung la suok an ta,"

"I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.","Ka ngai a, ka lo hriet a, anachu, thudik an hril nâwk a, mi tukhawm, “Ieng am ka lo thaw ta leh,” tiin a khawhlonaa inthawk chun ân sîr nawh a, mi tin chun mâni lampui seng an hrawh a, indonaa sakawr tlân bingbilet ang chun."

"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.","Thil tirdakum an thaw lai chun inzapui an ti?

"And they bend their tongue, as it were their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.","Thudik nawa dingin an thalngul ang elin an lei chu an thlep a; chu rama chun thahrâttakin an hung inṭhang a, thudika ruok chun ni loin; thil suola inthawkin thil suola vêk chun an pakai a, kei khawm an mi hriet hlawl nawh, LALPA chun a tih."

"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone.","An kâng zo tah a, tukhawm an fe tlang ta ngai naw leiin, tlânghai ta ding chun sûnin ṭapinrûm ka ta, thlalêra tlatna hmunhai ta ding chun sûn ka tih; mihai chun ran ruol râwl khawm chu hre thei ta naw ni hai a; chunglêng vatehai le ramsahai khawm chu an tlânse tah a, an tlân- hmang tah."

"Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.","Aigupta dâm, Juda dâm, Edom dâm, Ammon thlahai le, Moab thla- hai, barêp hmul vawa thlalêra chêng- hai po po le chun, chuong hnamhai po po chu sertan lo an na, Israel sûng- kuohai po po chu lungrila sertan lo an nih."
