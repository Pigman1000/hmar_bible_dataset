And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.,Ahab thi hnung chun Moab ram chu Israel ram chunga chun a hel tah a.
"And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.","Chun, Ahazia chu Samaria khuoa um a in pindan chunghnung inhuonna dai âwngkâra chun a tlah a, a damnaw tah a; chun, tirtâwnhai a tir a, “Fe unla, Ekronhai Pathien Baal-zebub chu hi natnaa inthawk hin ka dam nâwk ding am va râwn ta u,” tiin."
"But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?","Nisienlakhawm, Tisbe mi Elija kuoma chun LALPA vântirkoin, “Tho la, Samari lal tirtâwnhai chu intuokpui dingin fe rawh; chun, an kuoma chun, Israel rama hin Pathien a um ta naw leiin amanih Ekronhai pathien Baal-zebub chu râwn dinga in fe chu?"
"Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.","Tuhin, LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih, ‘Khum, i kainaa inthawk khan hung ṭum nâwk ta ngai dêr naw ti nih a, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih, a tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta.

"And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?","Chun, mitirhai chu a kuomah an hung kîr nâwk a, an kuomah, “Ieng- tiziea hung kîr nâwk am in nih a?” a lo tih a."
"And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Mi pa- khat keini mîn tuokpui dingin a hung a, kan kuomah, ‘Fe unla, kîr nâwk unla, lal a tirtu cheu kuoma chun hieng hin va hril ro, LALPA chun hieng hin a hril a nih, Israel rama hin Pathien a um ta naw leiin am a ni Ekronhai pathien Baal-zebub chu thu indawn dinga mi i tir chu?

"And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?","Chun, an kuoma chun, “Nangni intuokpui dinga hung a, hieng thuhai hung hriltu cheu chu mi ieng ang hrim am a ni leh?” a ta."
"And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.","Anni chun, “Ama chu sahmul puon sila, a kâwng chu kâwngkhia inhrên a nih,” an tih a, an dawn a. Chun, ama chun, “Elija, Tisbe mi kha a ni chu,” a ta."
"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.","Chun, lal chun sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu pakhat, a rawihai sâwm- nga le chun a tir tah a, chun, a kuoma chun a hang feh a, ngai ta, tlâng sîpa chun ama chu a lo ṭhung a.

"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.","Chun, Elija chun a dawn a, sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu kuoma chun, “Pathien mi ka ni chun, vâna in- thawkin mei hung tla thla sienla, nang le i rawihai sâwmnga kha kânghâwp vawng raw se,” a ta.

"And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.","Chun, a kuoma chun sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu dang le sâwmnga a tir nâwk a. Ama chu a hang feh a, a kuomah, “Aw nang Pathien mi, lal chun, ‘Hung thla raw se,’ a ti che,” a ta."
"And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.","Chun, Elija chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Pathien mi ka ni tak zet chun, vâna inthawkin mei hung tla thla sienla, nang le i rawihai sâwm- nga kha kânghâwp vawng raw se,” a ta.

"And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.","Chun, sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu le a rawihai sâwmnga ma a tir nâwk a.

"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight.","ngai ta, vâna inthawkin mei a hung tla thla a, kha sâwmnga pâwl hotu pahnihai kha, an rawihai sâwm- ngahai leh a kânghâwp vawng tah a; amiruokchu, tuhin ka hringna chu i mithmua chun hlutak ni raw se,” a tih a."
"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun Elija kuomah, “Ama kha zui thla la, ama kha ṭi naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, a tho a, ama chu a zui thlâk a, lal kuoma chun a fe tah a."
"And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.","Chun, a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih, ‘Ekronhai pa- thien Baal-zebub chu thu indawn dinga tirtâwnhai i lo tir hi, Israel rama hin Pathien rawn ding hrim an um naw lei a ni maw? chuleiin, khum i kainaa inthawk khan ṭum nâwk ta naw ti nih a, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.,"Chuongchun, Elijân LALPA thu a hril ang ngei chun ama chu a thi tah a. Chun, naupasal a nei naw leiin Juda lal Jehosaphat naupa Jehoram inlal kum hninaa chun Jehoram chun a aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Chun, Ahazia thilthaw danghai a thaw tahai chu Israel lalhai inlal lai chanchin ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up the sons of Ahab, saying,","Ahab chun Samaria chun nau- pasal sâwmsari a nei a. Chun, Jehu chun Samaria Jezreel khaw hotu, upahai kuoma le Ahab nauhai lo enkawl tleituhai kuoma chun lekha a thawn a."
"And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;","“Hi lekha hi in hmu phingleh, in pu nauhai chu in kuoma um an na; tawlailîrhai, sakawrhai, kulpui nei khuohai dâm, râlthuomhai khawm in nei a na;"
"look ye out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.","chuongchun, in pu nauhai laia a ṭha tak le a fel tak zawng suok unla, a pa lal ṭhungphaah inṭhungtir unla, in pu sûnghai do chu dopui ro,” tiin."
"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun an ṭi ta êm êm el a, “Ngai ta u, lal pahni khawm khan an hne ta naw a na, einin iengtin am hne thei hlak ei ta?” an ta."
"And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.","Chun, lal in sûnga hotu tak dâm, khawpui awptuhai dâm, upahai le naupanghai lo enkawltuhai chun Jehu kuoma chun, “I siehlawhai kan nih, thaw dinga i mi hril ang phawt chun thaw pei kan tih; tukhawm lalah siem naw ning ung ah, nangin ṭha i ti ang angin thaw el rawh,” tiin mi an tir a."
"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.","Chun, an kuomah, “Keia tienga ṭhang in na, ka thu in awi ding chun in pu naupasalhai lu hang la unla, zîngah hieng tik phât hin Jezreelah ka kuomah hung ro,” tiin lekha a thawn nâwk a. Lal naupasalhai chu sâwmsari an na, khawpui mi lienhai, anni enkawl tleituhai kuoma chun an um a."
"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel.","Chun, lekha chu an hmu chun lal naupahai chu an man a, a sâwmsari chun an that a, an luhai chu bâwm- rângah an sieh a, Jezreel khuoah a kuomah an inphur tah a."
"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.","Chun, thangko a hung a, “Lal naupasalhai lu chu an hung lâk tah,” tiin a hril a. Chun, ama chu, “Kul lûtna kawtkhâr bulah hmun hniah intieng khâwm unla, zinga chen um raw se,” a ta."
"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these?","Chun, a zînga chun a va suok a, a ngîr a, mi po po kuoma chun, “Mi fel in nih; ngai ta u, ka pu chu ka phier rûk a, ka lo sukhlum ta luoh a; anleh, hienghai po po hi tu that am an nih a?"
"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spake concerning the house of Ahab: for Jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.","LALPA chun Ahab sûnghai chungchâng thu a hril a, LALPA thu chu hnuoi chunga hin luong hmang el naw ni ti hre ro; LALPAIN a siehlaw Elija hmanga a hril kha a hung suktlung a ni ta hi,” a ta."
"So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.","Chuongchun, Jehu chu Jezreel khuoa Ahab sûnghai la um po po le, a mi lienhai po po le, a ruolhai po po le, a thiempuhai chu pakhat khawm hlapêk hlek loin a that fai vawng a."
"And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,","Chun, a tho a, a suok a, Sama- riah a fe tah a. Chun, lampuia berâm- puhai berâm hmul vâwna hmun a va tlung chun,"
"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.","Jehu chun Juda lal Ahazia unauhairawi a hmuh a, “Tuhai am in nih a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Ahazia unauhai kan na, lal nauhai le; lalnu nauhai chibai kan zu bûk ding a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.","Chun, ama chun, “A hringin man tâwl ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, a hringin an man tâwl a, berâm hmul vâwna in khur bula chun an that a, mi sâwmli le pahni zet an nih, pakhat khawm an hla nawh."
"And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.","Chun, chutaka inthawka a suok hnung chun Rekab naupa Jehonadab, ama tuok dinga hung a va hmuh a; chuongchun, chibai a bûk a, a kuom- ah, “I chunga lungril indik ka put ang hin lungril indik i put ve am chu?” a ta.

"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka kuomah hung ve la, LALPA ta dinga ṭhahnem ka ngaizie hi hang hmu ve hrim ta khai,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tawlailîra chun ân chuongtir ve tah a."
"And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake to Elijah.","Chun, Samari a va tlung chun Ahab sûnghai Samaria la um sunhai chu a sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chun a that pei a, Elija kuoma a hril, LALPA thu ang ngei khan."
"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.","Chun, Jehu chun mipuihai po po chu a ko khâwm a, an kuoma chun, “Ahab khan Baal rawng hi a bâwl met chau a na, Jehu ruok hin chu nasa- takin a nih a bâwl ding chu."
"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.","Chuongchun, Baal zâwlneihai po po le a betuhai po po le a thiem- puhai po po ka kuoma hin hung ko khâwm ta u; tukhawm a kim naw um naw raw se, Baal kuoma hin in- thâwina ropuitak inhlân ding ka nei a, tukhawm a kim naw taphawt chu hring dêr naw nih,” a ta. Nisien- lakhawm, Jehu chun Baal betuhai chu sukhlum tumin, var vervêkin a thaw a nih."
"And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.","Chun, Jehu chun, “Baal hming- in ruoiṭhena ropui siem ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, chu chu an inthawn vêl tah a."
"And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.","Chun, Jehu chun Israel ram po poah a thawn vêl a; chuongchun, Baal betuhai po po chu an hung a, ṭhang naw hrim hrim an um nawh. Chun, Baal ina chun an lût a; chun, Baal in chu kawtkhâra inthawka châwrtieng chenin an sip mup el a."
"And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.","Chun, inthuomna puon enkawl- tu kuomah, “Baal betuhai po po hi inthuomna puon hung lapêk ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, inthuomna puonhai chu a hung lâkpêk a."
"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.","Chun, Jehu chu Rekab naupa Jehonadab le chun Baal inah an lût a, Baal betuhai kuoma chu, “Hitaka hin Baal betuhai ti lo, LALPA mihai lo um ve rawi an tih, zawng unla, en vêl ta u,” a ta."
"And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.","Chun, inthâwinahai le pumraw- hmang thilinhlân inhlân dingin an lût a.

"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu ân hlân zo chun Jehu chun vêngtu sipai le an hotu kuoma chun, “Va lût unla, va that ro, tukhawm insuoktir naw ro,” a ta. Chun, kâwl- hnâmin an sât rak el a; chun, vêngtu sipai le an hotuhai chun an pei suok a; chun, Baal in umna khuoa chun an feh a."
"And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.","Chun, Baal ina milimhai chu an lâksuok a, an rawh a."
"And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day.","Chun, Baal lungphun chu an sukchim a, Baal in chu an suksiet a, inhnâwmna inah an hmang tah a; tu chen hin an la hmang zing a nih."
Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.,Chuong ang chun Jehu chun Baal chu Israel rama chun a suk- bohmang a nih.
"Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.","Nisienlakhawm, Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolna-Israelhai thil in- suksuoltira a thawhai chu Jehu chun a bân chuong nawh a; chu chu Bethel khuo le Dan khuoa rângkachak bâwngte lim biek a nih."
"And Jehovah said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.","Chun, LALPAIN Jehu kuomah, “Ka mittlungtaka thil i thaw lei le, ka lungril duthusâm angtaka Ahab sûnghai chunga i thaw leiin, i naupa- salhai chu suon li chenin Israel lalṭhungphaah ṭhung an tih,” a ta."
"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin.","Nisienlakhawm, Jehu chun LALPA, Israelhai Pathien dân chu a lungril po poin a pawm nawh a; Jero- boamin Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a suksuol kha a bân chuong nawh a."
In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;,"Chuong lai chun LALPA chun Israelhai chu a thlauthlâk ṭan tah a; chuongchun, Hazael chun Israel ram po poa chun a hne pei a;"
"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.","Jordana inthawka khawsak tieng, Gilead ram po po, Gadhai le, Reubenhai le, Manassehai dâm, Arnon ruoma Aroera inthawka Gilead le Basan ram tlung rakin."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Jehu chanchin danghai, a thil- thaw po pohai, a thilthawtheizie po pohai chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.,"Chuongchun, Jehu chu a pi le puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, Samari khuoah an phûm tah a. Chun, a naupa Jehoahaz chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.,Samari rama Israelhai chunga Jehu rorêl sûng chu kum sâwmhni le kum riet a nih.
"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.","Chun, Ahazia nu Athalia chun a naupa a thi ti a lo hriet chun, a tho a, lal nauhai po po chu a that vawng a."
"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;","Ahazia naupa Joas ruok chu lal Joram naunu, Ahazia farnu Jehoseba chun lal naupasal an thathai laia inthawk chun a ṭhuoi hmang a, a enkawltu leh khum pindanah ân umtir a.

And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.,"Chun, ama chu amanu le chun LALPA inah kum ruk an inbihmang a, chuongchun, Athalia chun chu rama chun ro a rêl tah a."
"And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the king’s son.","Chun, a kum sarinaa chun Jehoiadain Kereth mihai le vêngtu sipaihai laia mi sipai za hotuhai chu ân kotir a, LALPA inah a kuomah ân ṭhuoi lûttir a; chun, an kuomah thu a thlung a, LALPA ina chun ṭawng ân khâmtir a; lal naupa chu ân entir tâwl a."
"And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;","Chun, ama chun, “In thaw ding chu hieng ang hi a nih; nangni laia châwlnia hung dinghai hi hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khatin lal in chu vêng in ta;"
"and a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.","chun, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Sur kul kawtkhârah um in ta; chun, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu vêngtuhai hnungtienga kul kawtkhâra chun um in tih; chuong ang chun in chu vêng in ta, a dang- tuah in um ding a nih."
"And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king.","Chun, nangni laia pâwl hni, châwlnia ṭîn dinghai po po chun lal kâwl vêla LALPA in chu vêng in ta."
"And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in.","Chun, mi tinin hriemhrei chawi- in lal chu inhuol vêl in ta; tukhawm huol sûnga hung lût taphawt chu lo that pei ding a nih; chuongchun, lal chu a lût le suok chu zui pei unla,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.","Chun, sipai za hotuhai chun thiempu Jehoiada thupêk ang po po chun an thaw vawng a; chun, mâni rawihai seng châwlnia hung dinghai le; châwlnia ṭîn dinghai chu an ṭhuoi a, thiempu Jehoiada kuomah an feh a."
"And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu chun sipai za hotuhai chu LALPA ina um, lal David fei le phawhai chu a pêk a."
"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.","Chun, vêngtu sipaihai chun hriemhrei chawi sengin, in chang- tieng panga inthawk vawitieng chen- in, mâichâm le in hrûla chun lal chu an ngîr huol tuou a."
"Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king.","Chuongchun, lal naupa chu a hung ṭhuoi suok a, lallukhum ân khumtir a, inhriettirna thu chu a pêk a, lalah an siem a, hriek an nâl a; chun, an kut an ben a, “Pathienin laltak humhim raw se,” an ta."
"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:","Chun, vêngtu sipaihai le mipuihai ri chu Athaliain a lo hriet chun, LALPA ina mipuihai lai chun a va feh a;"
"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!","chun, a hang en a, ngai ta, lal chu dân angin ban hrûla hin a lo ngîr a, sipai hotuhai le tawtawrâwt mûttuhai chu lal kâwlah an ngîr a; chun, chu rama mi po po chu an hlim êm êm a, tawtawrâwt dâm an mût an mût a. Chuongchun, Athalia chun a puonhai a keithlêr a, “Phier rûkna! Phier rûkna a ni tah ie,” tiin a khêk a."
"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu Jehoiada chun sipai chunga hotua ruot sipai za hotuhai chu thu a pêk a, an kuomah, “Sipaihai kâra khan amanu kha in- suoktir ro, tukhawm ama zui ta- phawt chu kâwlhnâma sât hlum ding nîng a tih,” a ta; thiempu chun, “LALPA ina chu that ding a ni nawh,” a lo ti ta sih a."
So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house: and there was she slain.,"Chuongchun, lampui an inâwng a; chun, sakawr lûtna lampuiah lal inah a feh a; chutaka chun a nih an that chu."
"And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovah’s people; between the king also and the people.","Chun, Jehoiada chun LALPA le lal le mipuihai kâra chun LALPA mihai an hung nina dingin thu a thlung tah a; lal le mipuihai kâra khawm chun."
"And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.","Chun, chu rama mi po pohai chu Baal inah an feh a, an sukchim a; a mâichâmhai le a limhai chu an suk- nâwi vawng a; Baal thiempu Mattan khawm chu mâichâm bulah an that a. Chun, thiempu chun LALPA in vêngtu hotuhai a ruot a."
"And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.","Chun, sipai za hotuhai, Kereth mi dâm, vêngtu sipaihai le, chu rama mi po po chu a ṭhuoi a, LALPA ina inthawkin lal chu an hung ṭhuoi thlâk a, vêngtuhai kawtkhâra lûtin lal ina chun an feh a. Chuongchun, lalhai lalṭhungphaa chun a ṭhung tah a."
"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king’s house.","Chuongchun, chu rama mi po po chu an lâwm a, chun, khawpui chu buoi loin a um tah a; chun Athalia chu kâwlhnâmin lal inah an that a."
Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.,Jehoasin ro a rêl ṭan lai chun kum sari mi a nih.
In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.,"Jehu kum sari ân lal kum chun Jehoas chu ân lal ṭan a; Jerusalem khuoah kum sâwmli ân lal a; a nu hming chu Zibia, Beer-seba khuoa mi a nih."
And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.,"Chun, thiempu Jehoiadain Je- hoas chu ân chûktir sûng po chu LALPA mithmua thil ṭha a thaw hlak a."
Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.,"Amiruokchu, bâwlhmunhai chu sukbohmang a ni chuong nawh; bâwl- hmunahai chun mihai chu an inthâwiin riminhnik an la raw zing tho a."
"And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,","Chun, Jehoas chun thiempuhai kuomah, “LALPA ina lâklût, thil ser intlanna sum po po tiem sa tahai laia fe taphawthai ta dinga tuk, an hring- na intlanna sum dâm, tukhawma LALPA ina lâk lût an phal sum po pohai chu,"
"let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.","thiempuhaiin an hmêlhriethaia inthawkin lo la seng hai sienla, chuongchun, in sie, a sietna lai lai siem raw se,” a ta."
"But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.","Nisienlakhawm, lal Jehoas chu kum sâwmhni le kum thum ân lal hnung khawmin thiempuhai chun in sie chu an la siem naw rawp a."
"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no more money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.","Chuongchun, lal Jehoas chun thiempu Jehoiada le thiempu dang- hai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Ieng- dinga in sietna laihai hi in siem naw am?

"And the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.","Chun, thiempuhai chun mihai kuoma inthawka tangka lâk ta lo le, in sietna lai siemtu ni lo chu an remtih a."
"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, thiempu Jehoiada chun bâwm a lâk a, a sîn a verpawp a, LALPA ina lût changtieng panga, mâichâm bula chun ân ṭhut a, chu- taka chun LALPA ina tangka hung lâklût po po chu kawtkhâr vêngtu thiempuhai chun an lo sie pei a."
"And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, bâwma chun tangka a tam ta hle ti an hriet po leh lal lekhaziektu le thiempu laltak chu an hang feh a, an fûn a, LALPA ina tangka um zât chu an tiem a."
"And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,","Chun, an tangka tiem chu sinthawhai, LALPA in bâwltuhai chunga hotuhai chu an pêk a; anni chun LALPA in bâwltu, themthiem- hai le in bâwltuhai hlawa dâm, lung suttuhai le, lung cho suoktuhai hlawa dâm;"
"and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.","LALPA in sietna lai siemna ding thinghai le lung sutnaa dâm, in siemna dinga a pawimawnaa pohai chun an hmang hlak a."
"But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah;","Amiruokchu, LALPA in sûnga an tangka hung lâk chun LALPA in ta dinga tangkaruo nohai, khâwnvar puon chepnahai, maihûnhai, tawtaw- râwthai, rângkachak bûr le bêlhai, tangkaruo bûr le bêlhai an siem nawh a;"

"Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully.","Chun, sinthawtuhai an pêk dinga tangka an inkawltirhai khawm kha an enzuipui chuong nawh a, anni chun ringumtakin an thaw hlak sih a."
"The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was the priests’.","Bawsietna inthâwina thilin- hlân tangka le, suol inthâwina thilin- hlân tangkahai chu LALPA ina chun a lâklût nawh; thiempuhai chanpuol a nih."
"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.","Chun, Suria lal Hazael chun Gath khuo a hang rûn a, a hang lâk a; chun, Hazael chu Jerusalema fe pei a tum a."
"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.","Chun, Juda lal Jehoas chun Juda lal a puhai Jehosaphat hai dâm, Jehoram hai dâm, Ahazia hai dâm, lo inhlân tah thil serhai po po le, ama thil serhai le LALPA ina mi le lal ina ro siekhâwmnaa mi rângkachak um po pohai chu a lâk vawng a; Suria lal Hazael chu a thawn a; chuongchun, Jerusalem chu a nghatsan nâwk tah a."

"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goeth down to Silla.","Chun, a mihai chu an tho a, ama an phier rûk a, Joas chu Silla pan thlâkna lampuiah Millo inah an thawh a, an sukhlum a."
"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.","Ama mi Shimeath naupa Zozakar le Somer naupa Jehozabad chun an that a nih; chuongchun, a pi le puhai lai David khawpuia chun an phûm a; chun, a naupa Amazia chu a aiawin ân lal tah a."
"In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.","Juda lal Ahazia naupa Joas kum sâwm hni le kum thum ân lal kum chun Jehu naupa Jehoahaz chu Israelhai chungah Samari khuoa chun ân lal ṭan a, kum sâwm le kum sari ân lal a."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.","LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a thaw Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolnahai kha a chîng veh a, a mâksan nâwk ta hrim hrim nawh a."
"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, continually.","Chun, LALPA lung chu Israelhai chunga chun a chawk a, chuongchun, Suria lal Hazael kuta le, Hazael naupa Benhadad kuta chun a pêk ta pei a."
"And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.","Chun, Jehoahaz chun LALPA kuomah a ngên a ngên a; chun, LALPAIN a thu chu a lo ngaipêk a, Israelhai nêksâwra an um a, Suria lalin anni a nêksâwrzie chu a hmu zing sih a."
"(And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.","LALPA chun Israelhai chu san- damtu a pêk a; chuongchun, Suria mihai hnuoia an um chu an suok a, Israel thlahai chu kha hma ang bawk khan anni in tieng an um nâwk ta ṭawk ṭawk a."
"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)","Amiruokchu, Israelhai thil in- suksuoltira a thaw Jeroboam sûnghai suolna kha an mâksan nawh a; an la chîng ta zing lem a; chun, Samari khuoa chun Asera khawm chu a la um zing nghe nghe a."
"For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.","Jehoahaz chu a mihai laia sakawr chung chuong mi sâwmnga le tawlailîr sâwm le, sipai sîng khat ti naw chu nei a phalpêk si nawh a, Suria lal chun a sukbohmang vawng a, pilvut childip ang elin a siem a nih."

"Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!","Chun, Elisa chu a thipui ding natnain a hung na tah a, chuongchun, Israel lal Joas chu a kuomah a zu feh a, a ṭah a, “Pa, Pa, Israelhai tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai,” a ta;"
"And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows; and he took unto him bow and arrows.","Chun, Elisa chun a kuomah “Thalngul le thalhai hung la ta,” a ta; chun, thalngul le thalhai a hung lâk a."
"And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow; and he put his hand upon it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king’s hands.","Chun, Israel lal kuoma chun, “Thalngul kha hang chel ta,” a tih a, chuongchun, a hang chel a. Chun, Elisa chun lal kut chunga chun a kut ân nghat a."
"And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovah’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.","Chun, ama chun, “Saktieng tukver hang hawng ta,” a ta, chun, a hang hawng a.

"And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed.","Chun, “Thalhai kha hung la ta,” a ti nâwk a; chuongchun, a hei lâk a. Chun, Israel lal kuoma chun, “Hnuoi kha hei sun ta,” a ta; chuongchun, vawi thum a hei sun a, a ma ta el a."
"And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.","Chuongchun, Pathien mi chu a chunga chun a lunginsen tah a, “Vawi nga, vawi ruk lai i sun ding i sawnnaw; chuongchun, Suria mihai chu bo- hmang dêr khawpin i hne ding a nih.

"And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.","Chun, Elisa chu a thih a, an phûm tah a. Chun, kum a hung invawi po hin, Moab mihai chun an ram hi an hung rûn hlak a."
"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.","Chun, mi pakhat an phûm ding lai takin, ngai ta, pâwl pakhat an hei hmuh a; chuongchun, ama chu Elisa thlâna chun an thlâk el tah a; chun, a ruong chun Elisa ruhai chu a zu tâwk phingleh, a hung hring nâwk a, a hung ngîr el tah a."
And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.,"Chun, Suria lal Hazael chun Jehoahaz hun sûng chun Israelhai chu a nêksâwr zing a."
"But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN Ab- raham kuoma dâm, Isaak kuoma dâm, Jakob kuoma dâm khan thu a thlung leiin anni chu a lunginsiet a, a lainat a, a ngaisak a, anni chu a sukbohmang nuom nawh a, a kuoma inthawk chun a la pei thlâk nuom ta naw rawp a."
And Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Suria lal Hazael chu a thih a, a naupa Benhadad chu ama aiaw chun ân lal tah a."
"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.","Chun, Jehoahaz naupa Jehoas chun Hazael naupa Benhadadin a pa Jehoahaz a rûn a, khuo a lâkpêkhai kha a lâkpêk nâwk a, Joas chun vawi thum a hneh a, Israel ram khuohai chu a lâk nâwk a."

He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.,"Ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwmhni le kum nga mi a na, Jerusalemah kum sâwmhni le kum kuo ân lal a, a nu hming chu Jehoadin, Jerusalem mi a nih."

"but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.","amiruokchu, chuong tuolthat- tuhai nauhai ruok chu a that nawh a; Mosie dân bua, “Nauhai leiin pahai sukhlum ding a ni nawh a, pahai leiin nauhai sukhlum ding a ni bawk nawh a, mi tin chu mâni suol leiin an thi ding a nih,” tiha LALPA thupêk dân ziek ang khan."
"He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.","Edom mihai chu Machi Ruomah sîng khat a that a, Sela khuo chu a thawh a, a lâk a, a hming dingin Joktheel ân bûk a, tu chen hin an la ti a nih."
"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.","Chuongchun, Amazia chun Israel lal Jehu naupa Jehoahaz nau Jehoas kuoma chun, “Thaw ta, hmai sanah lo inen ei tih khai,” tiin mi a tir a."
"And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.","Chun, Israel lal Jehoas chun, Juda lal Amazia kuomah, “Lebanon tlânga hlingin Lebanon tlânga Sidar thing kuomah ‘I naunu kha ka naupa nuhmeiah inneitir ta khai,’ tiin ân chah a; chun, Lebanon tlânga ramsa a hung a, hling chu a hung chîl thlûk dêr el tah a."
"Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?","Nang hin Edom mihai chu i hne ngei luoh a, i lungril a hung chapo tah a ni hi, i chapona kha intawmpui ṭawk ṭawk el rawh, nang le Juda ram puma sietna, i ta dinga thil ṭha naw ding iengdingin am i cho suok ding an leh,” tiin mi a tir veh a."
"But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.","Nisienlakhawm, Amazia chun a lo ngai nuom nawh a. Chuongchun, Israel lal Jehoas chu a hang feh a, Juda lal Amazia le chun Juda ram Bethsemes khuoa chun hmai sanah an inen ta ngei a."
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.,"Chun, Juda chu Israelhai hmaa chun a lo tlâwm tah a, mi tin chu mâni in tieng an fe ta seng a."
"And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.","Chun, Israel lal Jehoas chun Juda lal Ahazia naupa Jehoas nau Amazia chu Bethsemesa chun a man a, Jerusalem khuoah a feh a, Jeru- salem kul chu Ephraim kul kawt- khâra inthawka kul kil kawtkhâr chenin tawng za li zet a sukchim a."

And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.,"Chun, a ruong chu sakawrin an fepui a, a pi le puhai lai David khaw- pui Jerusalema chun an phûm tah a."
"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.","Chun, Juda mi po pohaiin kum sâwm le kum ruk mi Azaria chu an ṭhuoi a, a pa Amazia aiah lalin an siem tah a."

Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.,"An lal ṭantir chun ama chu kum sâwm le kum ruk mi a na.

And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.,"Chun, a pa Uzzia thilthaw ang po thaw vein; LALPA mithmuah thil ṭhatak a thaw hlak a."
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah.,"Amiruokchu, bâwlhmunhai chu sukbo a ni chuong nawh; bâwl- hmunahai chun mihai chu an lân thâwiin, rim inhnik an la raw zing hlak.

"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.","Chuongchun, Suria lal Rezin le Israel lal Remalia naupa Peka chu Jerusalem thaw dingin an hang feh a; Ahaz chu an hang inhuol a, nisien- lakhawm, an hne thei nawh a."

"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.","Chuongchun, Ahaz chun Assuria lal Tiglath-pileser kuomah, “I siehlaw le i naupa ka ni annâwm, a mi thaw dinga hung inthawk, Suria lal kuta inthawk le Israel lal kuta inthawk hin mi hang sansuok ta khai,” tiin mi a tir a."

"And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.","Chun, lal Ahaz chu Assuria lal Tiglath-pileser be dingin Damaska khuoah a feh a, Damaska khuoa mâichâm chu a va hmuh a; chuong- chun, lal Ahaz chun chu mâichâm lim le an siem dân ang chiea enkhi dingin thiempu Urija kuomah ân phur a."

"And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.","Chun, Assuria lal chun Hosea in a phier rûk thu a lo hriet a, Aigupta lal So kuomah mi a tir bawk a, kum tina a pêk hlak ang khan Assuria lal chu sie chu a pêk ta bawk si nawh a; chuleiin, Assuria lal chun intângna inah khuop pumin a khum tah a."

"And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.","Chun, Assuria lalin Babulon khuoa mihai, Kutha khuoa mihai, Ava khuoa mihai, Hamath khuoa mi- hai, Sepharvaim khuoa mihai ân cha suok a; Samari ram khuoahai chun Israel thlahai hmun ân hluotir a, chuongchun, Samari ram chu an hluoh a, a khuoahai chun an um tah a."
"And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah: therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.","Chuongchun, chutaka an hang um hlim chun LALPA an ṭi nawh a; chuongchun, LALPAIN anni lai chun sakeibakneihai a tir a, mi ṭhen- khathai an seh a."
"Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the law of the god of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the law of the god of the land.","Chuongchun, Assuria lal kuoma chun, “I hung sawn hnamhai hin, Samari ram khuo în hluotirhai hin hieng lai ram Pathien biek dân hi an hriet ve nawh a; chuleiin, anni lai sakeibakneihai a tir tah a; chun, ngai ta, hieng lai ram Pathien biek dân an hriet naw leiin a se hlak a nih,” tiin an hril a."
"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.","Chuongchun, Assuria lal chun, “Khataka sala in ṭhuoihai laia mi thiempu pakhat ṭhuoi unla, hung um ve sienla, chu ram Pathien biek dân chu inchûktir raw se,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Samari rama inthawka an ṭhuoihai laia thiempu pakhat chu Bethel khuoah a va um a, LALPA an ṭi dân ding ân chûktir a."
"Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.","Nisienlakhawm, hnam tin chun mâni pathien seng an siem a, Samari mihaiin bâwlhmun an lo siemahai chun hnam tinin mâni umna khuo sengah an sieh a,"
"And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,","Babulon mihai chun Sukkoth- benoth an siem a, chun Kut mihai chun Nergal an siem a, Hamath mihai chun Asima an siem a;"
"and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.","Ava mihai chun Nibhaz le Tartak an siem a; chun, Sepharvaim mihai chun Sepharvaimhai pathien Adrammelek le Anammelek hmingin an nauhai an raw hlak a."
"So they feared Jehovah, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu an ṭih a, anni laia mi bâwlhmun thiempuhai an insiem a, bâwlhmun inahai chun mi an thâwi hlak a."
"They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.","LALPA chu an ṭih a, ana chu, an ṭhuoi suokna rama mihai hnam thaw dân angin anni pathien rawng chu an bâwl hlak a."
"Unto this day they do after the former manner: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Jehovah commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;","Kha hmaa an thaw dân angin tu chen khawm hin an la thaw zing a nih; LALPA chu an ṭi nawh a, LALPAIN Jakob thla Israelhai tia ân bûkhai kuoma a pêk thuruothai, rorêlhai, dânhai le thupêkhai khawm an zâwm bawk nawh."
"with whom Jehovah had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:","LALPA chun anni le thu thlung- in thu a pêk a, “Pathien danghai chu ṭi naw unla, anni chu chibai bûk naw unla, an kuomah inthâwi naw ro;"
"but Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him shall ye fear, and unto him shall ye bow yourselves, and to him shall ye sacrifice:","LALPA thilthawtheina nasatak le bân phar meua Aigupta rama in- thawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu ama chu in ṭi lem ding a nih ama chu chibai in bûk ding a na, a kuomah in inthâwi ding a nih;"
"and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods:","chuongchun, thuruot dâm, rorêl dâm, dân dâm, thupêk dâm a lo in- ziekpêk ta cheu kha kumkhuoin in pawm zing ding a na; pathien dang- hai chu in ṭi ding a ni nawh,"
and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:,"chun, in kuoma thu ka thlung hi in theinghil bawk ding a ni nawh a, pathien danghai chu in ṭi ding a ni bawk nawh;"
but Jehovah your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.,"LALPA in Pathien ruok chu in ṭi ding a nih; chuongchun, in hmêlma- hai po po kuta inthawk chun sansuok ka ti cheu,” tiin."
"Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.","Iengtin khawmin an pawm nuom chuong nawh a, kha hmaa an thaw dân angin an la thaw zing a."
"So these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children’s children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.","Chuongchun, chuong hnamhai chun LALPA chu ṭi chu an ṭih a, an milim siem fâwmhai rawng khawm an bâwl bawk a; chuong ang bawkin an thlahai le an thlahai thla chen khawmin tu chen hin an pi le puhai thaw dânin an la thaw zing a nih."
"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.","Chun, Ela naupa Israel lal Hosea kum thum ân lal kum chun Juda lal Ahaz naupa Hezekia chu ân lal ṭan a."
Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.,"Ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwmhni le kum nga mi a nih; chun, Jeru- salemah kum sâwmhni le kum kuo ân lal a; a nu hming chu Abi, Zekaria naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.","Chun, a pu David thilthaw ang po thaw vein, LALPA mithmua thil ṭhatak a thaw hlak a."
"He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.","Bâwlhmunhai a sukbo a, lung- phunhai a sukchim a, Asera dâm a phûr a; chun, Mosie dâr rûl siemhai chu a suknâwi vawng a; chuong lai hun chen chun Israel thlahai chun a kuomah riminhnik an la raw rawp hlak a nih; chu chu Nehustan an ti hlak a."
"He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him.","Ama chun LALPA Israelhai Pa- thien chu a ring a; chuongchun, ama hnunga Juda lalhai po pohai laiah ama ang tukhawm an um nawh a, ama hmaa khawm an um bawk nawh."
"For he clave to Jehovah; he departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPA chu a chel tlat a; ama a zui chu a ma nuom nawh a, a thupêk LALPAIN Mosie a pêkhai chu a zâwm a."
"And Jehovah was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu a kuomah a um a; a suok invâkna taphawta chun a tluongtlung pei a; Assuria lal chunga chun a hel a, a rawng a bâwl ta nawh a."
"He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.","Philistin mihai chu Gaza khuo chenin a ram chin po po leh, râl vêngtuhai in insânga inthawka kul nei khuo chenin a hne vawng a."
"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.","Chun, lal Hezekia kum li ân lal kum, Israel lal Ela naupa Hosea kum sari ân lal kum chun Assuria lal Salmaneser chun Samari khuo a hang thawh a, a hang inhuol a."
"And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.","Chun, kum thum ân vawi kum chun a lâk tah a; Hezekia kum ruk ân lal kum, Israel lal Hosea kum kuo an lal kumin a nih Samari khuo chu a lâk chu."
"And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,","Chun, Assuria lal chun Israel- hai chu Assuria ramah a ṭhuoi a, Hala rama dâm, Gozan rama Habor vadunga dâm, Media mihai khuoa dâm ân umtir tah a;"
"because they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.","LALPA an Pathien thu chu an pawm nuom nawh a, a thuthlung chu an bawsiet lem a, LALPAIN a siehlaw Mosie thu a pêkhai po pohai ngei kha an pawm nuom nawh a, an thaw nuom naw leiin."
"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.","Chun, lal Hezekia kum sâwm le kum li ân lal kumin Assuria ram lal Sennakerib chu Judai rama khuo kulpui nei po pohai chu thaw dingin a hang feh a; a lâk tah a."
"And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.","Chun, Juda lal Hezekia chun Lakis khuoa Assuria lal kuoma chun, “Thil ka lo suksuol tah a nih, mîn kiensan nâwk el rawh,” tiin thu a thawn a."
"And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house.","Chun, Assuria lal chun Juda lal Hezekia chu tangka talent za thum le rângkachak talent sâwmthum a tuk a. Chuongchun, Hezekia chun LALPA ina tangka um po po le lal ina ro siekhâwmnaa mi po po chu a pêk vawng a."
"At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.","Chu ṭum ngei chun Hezekia chun, LALPA biek in kawtkhâra mi le, Juda lal Hezekian bana rângka- chak ân luonhai chu a lâk thlâk vawng a, Assuria lal chu a pêk a nih."
"And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.","Chun, Assuria lal chun Tartan dâm, Rabsaris hai dâm, Rabsake hai dâm sipai tamtak leh Lakis khuoa inthawkin Jerusalem khuoa lal Hezekia kuoma chun a tir a. Chun, Jerusalem khuo chu an hang tlung a. An hang tlung chun puon sâwptu phûl lampuia dîl sakhnung lem, tuilâkna kâwla chun an ngîr a."
"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.","Chun, lal chu an hang ko chun, insûng tieng hotu Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai an kuomah an va suok a."
"And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?","Chun, Rabsake chun an kuom- ah, “Hezekia kuoma chun hang hril ro khai, ‘lal ropuitak Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a tih, I ring în nghatna hi ieng am a na?"
"Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?","Indonaa ding chun remruot thiem le hrâtna kan nei a nih i tih a; nisienlakhawm, chu chu ṭawngbau el a nih. Tu am i ring a, ka chunga hel i ni leh?"
"Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.","Ngai ta, hi luong hmawl pawr Aigupta hi i ring a ni âwm a; chu chu miin a ringsan chun a kutah sun a tih, Aigupta lal Pharao chu ama ringtuhai po po chunga chun chuong ang chu a ni hlak a nih."
"But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?","Annawleh ka kuomah, LALPA kan Pathien chu a nih ka ring chu, in ti chun, ama chu Hezekia chun Juda- hai le Jerusalem mihai kuoma Jerusalem khuoa hi mâichâm hmaa hin in biek ding a nih, tiin bâwl- hmunhai leh a mâichâmhai a lâk hmangpêk kha a ni naw am a nih?’ tiin."
"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.","Chuongchun, ka pu, Assuria lal le chun thu intiem ro, chuongchun, sakawr sâng hni pêng ka ti che, a chunga chuongtu dinghai i hmu thei ding phawt chun."
"How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?","Iengtin am tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai thua Aiguptahai chunga i ringna innghatin, ka pu mihai laia chîntak hotu pakhat khawm hi i dangkîr zo hrim ding am a nih?"
"Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.","Chun, hi ram hi LALPA thu ni loa sukse dinga hung am ka nih? LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Chu ram chu hang thaw la, sukse rawh, a ti a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.","Chun, Hilkia naupa Eliakim le Sebna le Joa hai chun Rabsake kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin, i sie- hlawhai hi Suria ṭawngin mi be ta lem rawh; chu chu kan hriet thei sih a; kul chunga mihai na hrieta hin Juda ṭawngin mi be ta naw rawh,” an ta."
"But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?","Nisienlakhawm, Rabsake chun an kuomah, “Ka pu chun in pu kuom le nangni kuom chaua hieng thu hi hril dingin a mi tir am a nih? Kul chunga ṭhunghai, nangni le anni mâni êk la fa ding le mâni zun la dâwn dinghai kuoma hin a mi tir a ni bawk naw am a nih?” a ta."
"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.","Chun, Rabsake chu a ngîr a, Juda ṭawngin râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Lal ropuitak Assuria lal thu hi lo ngai ro."
"Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:","Lal chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Hezekia hlêmin um naw ro; ama chun ka kuta inthawkin a sansuok thei âwm si naw cheu a;"
"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","Hezekia chun, LALPAIN mi sanhim ngei a ta; chun, hi khawpui hi Assuria lal kuta chun pêk ni naw nih, tiin LALPA chu inringtir naw raw se cheu."
"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;","Hezekia thu chu pawm naw ro, Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih: Mîn rempui unla, ka kuomah hung thla ro, mi tinin mâni grêp hruia mi le, mâni theichang kûnga mi fa seng unla, mi tinin mâni tuikhur tui tlân seng ro:"
"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.","nangni ram anga bu le uoin ram, bei le grêp huon ram, oliv le khuoizu ram, thi loa in hring theina ding rama ka hung ṭhuoi hmakhat cheu chun; Hezekian, LALPAIN mi sanhim a ta, tiha a thlêm cheu khawmin pawm nuom naw ro."
Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?,Hnam tinhai pathien po po laia mi hrim hrimin an ram chu Assuria lala inthawkin an sanhim ta hlak am a nih?
"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?","Hamath le Arpad pathienhai kha khâwlai am an um ta leh? Sepharvaim dâm, Hena dâm, Ivva dâm pathienhai khawm kha khâwlai am an um ta leh? Samari khuo kha keia inthawkin an sanhim am a nih?"
"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?","Ram tin pathienhai po po laia mi chun tuhai am an ram keimaa inthawka sanhim a, LALPA chun Jerusalem khuo hi keimaa inthawkin a sanhim ding hrim am a nih?’ tiin,” a tih a."
"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.","Anni chu an to zing a, bau khat khawma an dawn nawh; lal thupêk dân chu, “Anni chu dawn naw ro,” ti a ni sih a."
"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.","Chuongchun, lal insûng tieng hotu Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, le- khaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai chu an silfên keithlêrhai inbelin Hezekia kuoma chun an feh a, Rabsake thuhrilhai chu an hril a."
"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal Hezekia chun chu chu a hriet chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, saiip puon ân bel a, LALPA ina chun a lût tah a."
"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.","Chun, insûng tieng hotu Eliakim le, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, thiempu upahai chu saiip puon inbelin Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai kuomah a tir a."
"And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hezekia chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Vawisûn ni hi lunginzîngna ni le, halna ni le hmingsietna ni a nih; nauhai chu an pieng a hun ta sih a, nei dingin hrât- na a um ta si nawh."
"It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.","A pu Assuria lalin Pathien hring hming hrilse dinga a tir Rabsake thuhrilhai po po chu, LALPA i Pathien chun hrieng a ta, a thuhril, LALPA i Pathienin a thu hriet chu a la kâwk rawi mawh; chu chu lei chun a la um sunhai chu ṭawngṭaipêk rawh,’ a ti che,” an ta."
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.,"Chuongchun, lal Hezekia mihai chu Isai kuomah an feh a."
"And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.","Isai chun an kuomah, “In lalpa kuomah hieng ang hin hril ro,’ LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, I thu hriet, Assuria lal mihaiin an mi hrilsietna kha ṭi naw rawh."
"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.","Ngai ta, a sûnga chun thlarau inumtir ka ta, thuthang hrieng a ta, ama ramah fe nâwk a tih; chuong- chun, ama ram ngeia chun kâwl- hnâma sukthlûkin inumtir ka tih, a tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.","Chuongchun, Rabsake chu a kîr nâwk a, Assuria lal chun Libna khuo a lo thaw lai chu a va hmuh a; Lakis khuoa inthawk chun a suok tah ti a hriet hrim a na."
"And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,","Chun, “Ngai ta, nangma chu thaw dingin a suok tah,” tia Tirhaka, Ethiopia ram lal chungchâng thu Assuria lal Sennakerib mi hril a lo hriet chun, Hezekia kuomah mihai a tir a,"
"Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","“Hieng ang hin Juda lal Hezekia kuoma chun hril ro, ‘I Pathien i ring chun Jerusalem khuo Assuria lal kuta pêk ni naw nih tiin hlêm naw raw se che."
"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?","Ngai ta, Assuria lalhaiin ram po po sukse vawnga, a chunga an thil- thawhai kha i hriet a; nang hi sanhim i ni bîk ding am a nih?"
"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?","Hnam tin pathienhai chun ka pi le puhaiin an sukbohmanghai kha an sanhim hlak am a nih? Gozan dâm, Haran dâm, Rezeph dâm, Eden nau hai Telassar khuoa umhai,"
"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?","Hammath lal hai, Arpad lal hai, Sepharvaim khawpui lal hai, Hena lal dâm, Ivva lal dâm kha khâwlai am an um ta leh?’ tiin,” a ta."
"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.","Chun, Hezekia chun a mitirhai kuta inthawk chun lekha a hmuh a, a hang tiem a: chuongchun, Hezekia chu LALPA ina chun a hang lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a phar a."
"And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, that sittest above the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.","Chun, Hezekia chu LALPA hmaah a ṭawngṭai a, “Aw LALPA, cherubhai chunga ṭhung, Israel Pa- thien, nang, nang chau hi hnuoi chung ram po po Pathien chu i nih; hnuoi le vân hi nangma siem a nih."
"Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God.","Aw LALPA, i na lo sit la, ngai ta, Aw LALPA i mit meng la, en ta; Pathien hring chu hrilse dinga Sen- nakeribin thu a hung hril hi ngai ta;"
"Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,","LALPA, Assuria lalhaiin hnam- hai le an ramhai chu an suksiet hlak luoh a;"
"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.","an pathienhai chu meiah an pei bawk hlak a; chuonghai chu pathien an ni naw hrim a, mihriem kuta siem, thing le lung an ni lem a nih; chu lei chun an sukbohmang a nih."
"Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save thou us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah art God alone.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA kan Pa- thien, nang, nangma chau hi LALPA Pathien i nih ti hnuoi chung ram po po hin an hriet theina dingin amaa inthawk hin mi sanhim ngei ngei rawh,” tiin."
"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee.","Chuong lai chun Amoz naupa Isai chun Hezekia kuomah, “LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih ‘Assuria lal Sennakerib sietna ding tienga ka kuoma i ṭawngṭai kha ka lo hriet,’ tiin, mi a tir a."
This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.,"Hi hi a chungchâng thu LALPA- IN a hril chu a nih, ‘Zion naunu nunghâk chun a hmusit cheh a, a nuisan che a nih; Jerusalem naunu chun a lu a thin khum bawk cheh a."
Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.,"Tu am i sukhmingsiet a, i hril- siet? Tu chung âm i râwl i sukpuom a, i mit i meng insâng? Israel Mi Inthieng chunga hin annâwm."
"By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.",I mitirhai hmangin LALPA chu i sukhmingsiet a.

"I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.","Ram dang tui ka cho suok a, ka tlân hlak a, ka kepha hnuoi hin Aigupta vadunghai po po chu suk- kang vawng ka tih, i tih a."
"Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.","Keimain inhmaa inthawka chuong chu ka thaw a nizie dâm, inhma laia chuong chu ka siem a nizie dâm chu i hriet naw am a nih?

"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.","Chuleiin, a sûnga umhai chun hrâtna an nei nawh a, an zâm a, an hung muolpho ta kha; phûl hlobet ang le hna hring ang le, in chunga hlobet ang le, bu lien hmaa thli em vuoi ang an ni kha."
"But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.","Kei chun i ṭhung dâm, i lût le i suok dâm, ka chunga i lunginsen hi ka hriet i sawnnaw."
"Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.","Ka chunga i lunginsen lei le, i ṭawng uong chu ka naa a hung lût tâk leiin ka hnâr inbûk chu i hnârah inbûk ka ta, ka thîrse chu i hmûrah, i hungna lampuia ngei khan inkîrtir nâwk ka ti che,’ tiin."
"And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.","Chun, hi hi i ta dinga inchikna nîng a ta, tu kum hin bu inhli ring in ta, kum nâwk khawm bu inhli bawk; chun, a kum thumnaa chun buhai tu unla, sîk unla, grêp huonhai siem unla, a rahai fa ro."
"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.","Chuongchun, Juda sûnghai laia a la dam sunhai chun a suktiengin zung kei an ta, a tung zâwngin ra nâwk an tih."
"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.","Jerusalema inthawkin a la um sunhai, Zion tlânga inthawkin a la damhai chu an suok ding a nih: LALPA ṭhahnemngaina chun chuong chu thâwng a tih."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun Assuria lal chungchâng thu chu hieng ang hin a hril: ‘Hi khawpui hi hung tlung naw nih a, hitaka hin thal kâp bawk naw nih; phaw leh a kâwla hin hung bawk naw nih a, a khaw hrûla hin hnuoi dêng pâwng bawk naw ni hai."
"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.","An hungna lampuiah, chutaka ngei chun lêt nâwk a ta, hi khawpui hi hung tlung naw nih,’ LALPAIN a tih."
"For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.","Keima lei le ka siehlaw David leiin hi khawpui hi sanhim dingin ka vêng ding a nih,” tiin."
"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.","Chuongchun, chu zân chun hieng ang hi a hung na, LALPA vân- tirko chu ân thawk suok a, Assuria mihai riekhmuna chun mi nuoi khât le sîng riet le sâng nga a sukhlum a; chun, zîngkâra an hang tho chun, ngai ta, mithi ruong khât el a lo ni tah el a."
"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.","Chuongchun, Assuria lal Sen- nakerib chu a suok a, a kîr nâwk a, a fe nâwk ta pei a, Ninevi khuoa chun a um tah a."
"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, a pathien Nisrok ina chun ama a biek laiin hieng ang hi a hung na, Adrammelek le Sarezer hai chun ama chu kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum tah a; chuongchun, Ararat rama chun an tlân lût tah a.

"And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.","Chun, LALPA chun Elija chu thli- vira vâna a zuk lâk ding lai chun Elija chu Elisa leh Gilgala inthawk chun an feh a."
"And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.","Chun, Elija chun Elisa kuomah, “Hitaka hin lo um hri rawh, ka ngên che hi, LALPA chun Bethel chena fe dingin a mi tir a nih,” a ta.

"And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.","Chun, Bethel khuoa zâwlnei nau- pasal umhai chu Elisa kuomah an hung a, a kuomah, “Vawisûn hin i chunga hotu hi LALPAIN a lâk hmangpêk ding che a nih ti i hriet am?” an ta.

"And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.","Chun, Elija chun, “Elisa, hitaka hin lo um phawt rawh, ka ngên che hi, LALPA chun Jeriko chena fe dingin a mi tir sih a,” a ta.

"And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.","Chun, Jeriko khuoa zâwlnei nau- pasalhai chu Elisa kuomah an hung a, a kuomah, “Vawisûn hin i chunga hotu hi LALPAIN a lâk hmangpêk ding che a nih ti i hriet am?” an ta. Chun, ama chun, “Aw ka hriet, lo to ṭawk ṭawk unla,” a ta."
"And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.","Chun, Elija chun a kuomah, “Hitaka hin lo um rawh, ka ngên che hi, LALPA chun Jordan vadung chena fe dingin a mi tir sih a,” a ta.

"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.","Chun, zâwlnei naupasalhai mi sâwmnga an fe veh a, hlataka hin an hmazâwnah an ngîr a, anni chu Jordan vadung panga chun an ngîr tah a."
"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.","Chun, Elija chun a puon chu a hlîp a, ân têl a, tui chu a vuok tah a, chuongchun, khingtieng khingtieng chun a lo inṭheh a, an pahni chun hnuoi hula chun an fe kai tah a."
"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.","Chun, an kai hnung chun Elija chun Elisa kuomah, “I kuoma in- thawka lâk hmang ka ni hma hin, i ta dingin ieng am thawpêk ka ti cheh a, mi hni rawh?” a ta.

"And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.","Ama chun, “Thil intaktak i hni a ni chu, iengkhawm ni sienla, i kuoma inthawka lâk hmanga ka um lai i hmu chun, chuong ang chun i chung- ah um a tih, i mi hmu naw ruok chun chuong ang chu ni naw nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.","Chun, an fe pei a, an la ṭawng zing laiin, ngai ta, mei sakawr taw- lailîr le mei sakawrhai a hung inlang a, chu chun anni chu an kâra tlain a ṭhe tah a; chun, Elija chu thlivira chun vânah a lâwn tah a."
"And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.","Chun, Elisa chun a hmuh a, “Pa, Pa! Israel sakawr tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai!” tiin a khêk a."
"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.","Elija puon amaa inthawka hung tla chu a lâk a, a kîr a; Jordan vadung panga chun a ngîr tah a."
"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.","Chun, Elija puon amaa in- thawka tla chu a lâk a, “Elija Pathien LALPA chu khâwlai am a um a?” a tih a, tui chu a vuok a, chuongchun, khingtieng khingtieng chun tui chu an lo inṭhe tah a. Chun, Elisa chu râlkhing chu a kai tah a."
"And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.","Chun, zâwlnei naupasalhai Jeriko khuoa umhaiin ama chu an lo hmu nâwk chun, “Elija thlarau kha Elisa chunga hin a um ta ngei el,” an tih a, ama chu tuok dingin an hung suok a, a hmaa chun hnuoi sikin an kûn a, chibai an bûk tâwl a."
"And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, tuhin pasal hrât i siehlaw- hai kuoma hin sâwmnga an um a, kan ngên che hi, anni chu tir la i hotupa chu inzawngtir rawh, ama chu LALPA thlarau chun lain, tlâng khaw laia manih, ruom khaw laia manih a lo inthlâk hlau rawi mawh,” an ta.

"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.","Ama chu inzak khawp raka an phût an phût hnunga chun ama chun, “Tir ta unla,” a ta. Chuongchun, mi sâwmnga chu an tir a, ni thum sûng an zawng a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu zo nawh a."
"And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?","Chun, anni chu Jeriko khuoa a la châm sûng chun an hung tlung nâwk a, ama chun an kuomah, “Fe naw ro, ka ti hrim cheu a ni naw am a nih,” a lo tih a."
"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.","Chun, chu khawpuia mihai chun Elisa kuomah, “Ngai ta, kan ngên che hi, hi khaw um dân hi ân hawi hle a, kan pu hin i hmu ve zing a; nisienlakhawm, tui hi a ṭha nawh a, a ram khawm hi a takchang naw a nih,” an ta."
"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Tuiûm thar mi hung lapêk unla, a sûngah chi hung sie ro,” a ta. Chun, an hung lâkpêk tah a."
"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.","Chun, tuikhur hnârahai chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun chi chu a phul a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Hi tui hi ka sukhnik tah a, tuta inthawk chu thina hrim hrim le, takchangnawna po po ka sukbo tah,’ tiin,” a ta."
"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.","Chuongchun, Elisa thuhril ang ngei chun tu chen hin tuihai chu sukṭhat an ni tah a."
"And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun Bethelah a hang feh a, chun, lampuia a fe lai chun khawpuia inthawk hin naupang chitê tehai chu an hung suok a, ama chu an nuisan a, a kuomah, “Hang fe rawh, nang lusîp kawlpa,” an ta."
"And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.","Chun, a hnungtieng a hei en chun anni chu a hmu tah a, chuong- chun, LALPA hmingin anni chu ṭawngsie ân phur tah a.

"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun Karmel tlângah a feh a, chutaka inthawk chun Samari ramah a kîr nâwk tah a."
"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.","Chuong lai chun Hezekia chu thi ngamin a na a.

"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, saying,","Chuongchun, bang tieng ngha chun ân let a, LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a."
"Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.","“Aw LALPA, i hmaa thutak le lungril ṭha famkim puta ka um hlakzie le, i mithmua thil ṭha ka thaw hlakzie kha hre zing dingin ka hung ngên che a nih,” tiin. Chun, Hezekia chu a ṭap ta ngawi ngawi a."
"And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,","Chun, Isai chun khawpui lailung vêl chu a tlung hmain hieng hi a hung na, LALPA thu chu a kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of Jehovah.","“Kîr nâwk la, ka mihai hotu Hezekia kuomah hril rawh, ‘LALPA, i pu David Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih: I ṭawngṭaina kha ka hriet a, i mitthli tla khawm ka hmuh a, ngai ta, sukdam ka ti cheh a, ni thum nia chun LALPA inah hang fêng i tih."
"And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.","Chun, i dam sûng kumhai hi kum sâwm le kum ngain suksei ka ta; chun, nang le hi khawpui hi Assuria lala inthawk chun sanhim ka tih; chun, keima lei le ka siehlaw David leiin hi khawpui hi hum ka tih, a tih,’ tiin.”"
"And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.","Chun, Isai chun, “Theichang ra hlawm khat hung la ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, an hung lâk a, khuoihlia chun a bel a, a hung dam nâwk tah a."
"And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of Jehovah the third day?","Chun, Hezekia chun Isai kuom- ah, “LALPAIN mi sukdam a ta, LALPA inah a ni thum niin hang fêng ka tih ti inchikna ieng am nîng a ta?” a ta."
"And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?","Isai chun, “LALPAIN a thil hril hi thaw ngei a tih ti, hi hi LALPA kuoma inthawka inchikna chu ning a tih: hlim chu sirbi sâwm chena a hang intâwl am i nuom, sirbi sâwm chena ân tâwl kîr?” a ta."
"And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.","Hezekia chun a dawn a, “Hlim chu sirbi sâwm chena a hang intâwl chu a awl êm a, chu chu ni lo e, hlim chu sirbi sâwm chenin intâwl kîr lem raw se,” a ta."
"And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Jehovah; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.","Chuongchun, zâwlnei Isai chun LALPA a hang ko a; chun, Ahaz dâr chin hrietnaa hlim inhnuoi ta chu sirbi sâwm chenin a sukkîr nâwk tah a."
"At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.","Chuong lai chun Baladan naupa Babulon lal Merodak-baladan chun lekhahai le thilpêk dâm Hezekia a thawn a, Hezekia chu a na ti a hriet leiin."
"And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.","Chuongchun, Hezekia chun anni chu a lo lâwm a, a thil hlu siena in po pohai, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, thil riminhnik dâm, hriek hlutak dâm, a râlthuom siena in sûng dâm, a ro umhai po po chu ân entir a; a ina mi le a ram sûnga mi Hezekia chun ân entir naw hrim hrim a um nawh."
"Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.","Chuong lai chun zâwlnei Isai chu Hezekia kuoma chun a feh a, a kuomah, “Khahai khan ieng am an hril a?

"And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.","Chuongchun, ama chun, “I ina hin ieng ieng am an hmuh a?” a ta. Chun, Hezekia chun, “Ka in sûnga um po po chu an hmu vawng a, ka ro laia thil kân entir naw hrim hrim a um nawh,” tiin a dawn a."
"And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.","Chun, Isaiin Hezekia kuoma chun, “LALPA thu hi lo ngai raw khai,"
"Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.","‘Ngai ta, i in sûnga um po po le vawisûn ni chena i pi le puhaiin an lo inkhâwl chu Babulon khuoa an fepui nihai la hung tlung a tih; iengkhawm mâksan hrim hrim um naw nih,’ LALPAIN a tih."
"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.","‘Chun, i rîla ra, i nei ding, i nauhai ngei laia mi khawm an fepui ding a nih, Babulon lal ina chun mitillâk la nîng an tih,’ a tih,” tiin."
"Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?","Chuongchun, Hezekia chun Isai kuomah, “I hril LALPA thu hi a ṭha ie,” a ta. Chun, “Ka dam sûng hin inremna le thutak a um ding phawt chun,” a ti nâwk nghâl a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Hezekia chanchin danghai, a thilthawtheizie po po dâm, dîl le tuilâkna a siem a, khawpui sûnga tui a lâk lût thu dâm chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Hezekia chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Manasse chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hephzibah.,"Manasse chu ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwm le kum hni mi a nih; Jerusalemah kum sâwmnga le kum nga ân lal a, a nu hming chu Heph- ziba a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.","Chun, LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawtsuok tah, hnamhaiin thil tirdakumtak an thaw hlak ang, LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtakhai chu a thaw hlak a."
"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.","A pa Hezekiain a suksiet tah bâwlhmunhai chu a siem ṭha nâwk a; Israel lal Ahab thaw angin Baal mâichâmhai a siem a, Aserahai a siem a, vâna um po po khi a biek a, an rawng a bâwl a."
"And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.","LALPAIN, “Jerusalemah ka hming inumtir ka tih,” a tina, LALPA ina chun mâichâmhai a siem a."
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.,LALPA in inhuonna sûng pahnia chun vâna um po pohai ta dingin mâichâm a siem a.
"And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.","Chun, a naupa chu meiah ân lûttir a, aisân dâm a chîng a, dawi dâm a hmang a, khawhri aisân thiem zâwlhai le dawithiemhai a ruoi hlak a; LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw- tak ama suklungsen dingin a thaw hlak a."
"And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;","Chun, LALPAIN David le a naupa Solomon kuoma, “Hi in le Jerusalem khuo, Israel chihai po po laia ka ithlanga hin, ka hming chu kumkhuoin inumtir ka ta;"
"neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.","thu ka pêk ang po le, ka siehlaw Mosien dân a pêk ang po po kha an pawm phawt chun an pi le puhai ka pêk tah rama inthawkin Israelhai kehai khawm hi inpên suoktir ta bawk naw ning,” a lo ti tah ina chun Asera lim a siem chu a sieh a."
But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.,"Nisienlakhawm, an pawm nuom nawh a, LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawt suok tah hnamhai thaw nêk hmana nasa lem thil suksuol dingin Manasse chun mihai a thlêm thlûk hlak a."
"And Jehovah spake by his servants the prophets, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN a siehlaw zâwlneihai hmangin thu a hril a,"
"Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;","“Juda lal Manasse hin hieng thil tirdakumtakhai hi a thawh a, a hmaa Amor mihai nêk hmanin a suksuol nasa a, Judahai hi a milimhaiin thil ân suksuoltir leiin:"
"therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.","LALPA, Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ngai ta u, Jerusalem le Juda chunga hin a hre taphawthai na khing hni ṭhâwng khawp thil ṭha naw ka hung in- tlungtir ding a nih."
"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.","Samari inkhina hrui le Ahab sûngkuo dârmûmkhai chu Jerusalem chungah keimar ka tih; chun, miin thlêng a hrûk a, ân let vêl angin Jerusalem chu hrûng ka tih."
"And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;","Chun, ka rochan a la um sunhai chu pei thlâng ka ta, an hmêlmahai kutah pêng ka ta; an hmêlmahai po po man ding le râllâk ding nîng an tih,"
"because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.","an pi le puhai Aigupta rama an hung suoka inthawka vawisûn ni chen hin ka mithmuah thil ṭha naw- tak an thaw a, an mi suklungsen lei hin,’ tiin,” a ta."
"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.","LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw- tak thawa Judahai thil ân suksuoltir a suolna tiem loin, Manasse chun pawi tâwklo thisen nasatakin ân suo bawk a, Jerusalem dung le khang chu a sip a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Manasse chan- chin danghai a thilthaw po pohai, a thil suksuolhai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Manasse chu a pi le puhai kuoma chun a in a, Uzza huona ama in bul huonah an phûm tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Amon chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.,"Amon chu ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwmhni le kum hni a na; Jerusalema chun kum hni ân lal a; a nu hming chu Mesullemet, Jotba khuoa Haruz naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father.","Chun, a pa Manasse thaw ang bawkin LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
"And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:","A pa lampui hraw po po chu a hraw veh a, a pain milim rawng a bâwlhai chu a bâwl veh a, chibai a bûk a;"
"and he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.","chuongchun, LALPA, a pi le puhai Pathien chu a mâksan a, LALPA lampui chu a hraw nawh a."
"And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.","Chun, a mihaiin Amon chu an phier rûk a, lal chu ama in ngeia chun an that a."
But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.,"Nisienlakhawm, chu rama mihai chun lal Amon phier rutuhai po po chu an sukhlum ve ta vawng a; chu rama mihai chun a naupa Josia chu a aiawin lalah an siem tah a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chun, Amon thilthaw danghai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Uzza huonah ama thlân- ah an phûm a, chun, a naupa Josia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.,"Josia chu ân lal ṭantirin kum riet mi a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwm thum le kum khat ân lal a, a nu hming chu Jedida, Bozkath khuoa Adaia naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.","Chun, LALPA mithmuah thil feltak a thaw hlak a, a pa David lampui po po chu a hraw veh a, chang- tienga manih, vawitienga manih a pêtsan nawh a."
"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,","Chun, lal Josia ân lal kum sâwm le kum riet kumin lal chun Mesullam naupa Azalia naupa lekhaziektu Saphan chu a tir a,"
"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:","“Thiempu laltak Hilkia kuomah hang fe la, kawtkhâr vêngtuhaiin mihai kuoma an lo lâk khâwm LALPA ina tangka hung sie chu tiem sienla;"
"and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,","LALPA in bâwltu sinthawtuhai pe raw se; chun, anni chun in sietna siemtu LALPA ina sinthawtuhai pe raw se;"
"unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.","thingrem siemtuhai, in bâwl- tuhai, in se siemtuhai chun in a sietna lai siemna dingin thing le lung sutsa an inchâwk theina dingin,” tiin LALPA inah a tir a."
Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.,"Nisienlakhawm, tangka an pêk chu an enzuipui ta chuong nawh a, ringumtaka an thaw hlak leiin."
"And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.","Chun, thiempu laltak Hilkia chun lekhaziektu Saphan kuomah, “LALPA ina dân lekhabu chu ka hmu tah,” a ta. Chun, Hilkia chun lekhabu chu Saphan kuomah a pêk a, ama chun a tiem tah a."
"And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lekhaziektu Saphan chu lal kuomah a feh a, lal kuomah thu chu a vân tlun nâwk a, “I mihai chun ina tangka um chu an pêk suok vawng a, LALPA in bâwltu sinthaw- tuhai an pêk vawng tah,” a ta."
"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.","Chun, lekhaziektu Saphan chun, “Thiempu lal tak Hilkia chun lekhabu a mi lo pêk annaw,” tiin lal chu a hril a. Chun, Saphan chun lal hmaa chun a tiem a."
"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.","Chun, lal chun dân lekhabu thuhai chu a hang hriet chun a puon- hai a keithlêr tah a."
"And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,","Chun, lal chun thiempu Hilkia hai, Saphan naupa Ahikam hai, Mikaia naupa Akbor hai, lekhaziektu Saphan hai, lal mi Asaia hai kuoma chun,"
"Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.","“Kei le, mipui le, Juda mihai po po hi hi lekhabu hmua thu chuonga hin LALPA mi va râwnpêk ta u, ei thaw dinga hi lekhabua ziek ang po po hi ei pi le puhaiin an lo zâwm naw leiin ei chungah LALPA lunginsenna chu a ṭal nasa ta êm hi,” a ta."
"So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her.","Chuongchun, thiempu Hilkia hai, Ahikam hai, Akbor hai, Saphan hai, Asaia hai chu silfên enkawltu Harhas nau Tikva naupa Sallum nuhmei zâwlneinu Hulda kuoma chun an va feh a, an va râwn a. (Ama chu Jerusalem Misneha um a na)."
"And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,","Ama chun an kuomah, “LALPA Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ka kuoma hung tirtu cheu hi hril ro,"
"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.","LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Ngai ta, hi hmuna le, a sûnga chêng- hai chunga hin thil ṭha nawtak ka hung intlungtir ding a nih, Juda lal- in lekhabua a thu tiem ang po po kha;"
"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.","an mi mâksan a, pathien danghai kuomah riminhnik an rawh a, an kutsuoka an mi suklungsen leiin hi hmuna hin ka lunginsenna chu a chawk nasa ding a na, rêm el naw nih."
"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA rawn dinga hung tirtu cheu Juda lal kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril ro: LALPA Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih: I thu hriet chungchâng thua chun-"
"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.","hi hmun le a sûnga chênghai hi sukrêm le ṭawngsephurin la um an tih ti thu ka hril kha i lo hriet a, i lungril dâm a hung innêm a, LALPA hmaa inngaitlâwm a, i puonhai i keithlêr a, ka hmaa i ṭap leiin kei khawma i thu chu ka lo hriet a, LALPAIN a tih."
"Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.","Chuongchun, ngai ta, i pi le puhai kuomah ṭhuoi ka ti cheh a, thlânah lungmuongtaka ṭhuoiin um i ta, hi hmuna thil ṭha nawtak ka hung intlungtir ding chu i mitin hmu ve naw nih, a tih,’ tiin,” a ta. Chuongchun, thu chu lal kuoma chun an vân tlun nâwk a."
"And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.","Chun, lal chun mi a tir a, Judai ram le Jerusalema upahai po po a kuomah an ko khâwm ṭeu a."
"And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal chu Judai rama mi po po leh, Jerusalem khuoa mi po po leh, thiempuhai le zâwlneihai leh, mipui- hai po po le chun, a chîn a lienin LALPA ina chun an hang feh a; chun LALPA ina an lekhabu hmua thu- thlung bua chuong po po chu an na hrieta chun a tiem a."
"And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.","Chun, lal chu ban hrûlah a ngîr a, chu lekhabua chuong thuthlung thu chu sukdet dingin lungril po po le thlarau po poa LALPA zui ding le a thupêkhai, a thu inhriettirhai, a thuruothai pawm dingin LALPA hmaa chun thu a thlung a;"
"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.","chun, mipui po po khawm chun an thlungpui a.

"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.","Chun, milim betuhai thiempu- hai, Juda lalhaiin Judai ram khawpui bâwlhmunahai, Jerusalem vêla rim- inhnik raw dinga an lo ruothai khawm chu ân bântir a; Baal ta ding dâm, nisa ta ding dâm, thla ta ding dâm, arasi ta ding dâm, vâna umhai po po ta dinga riminhnik rawtuhai khawm chu."
"And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people.","Chun, LALPA ina Asera chu Jerusalem puotieng, Kidron vadung- ah a lâk suok a, Kidron vadunga chun a rawh a, a sir nawi dap a, a nawi chu mi narânhai thlânah a theh a."
"And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.","Chun, Asera puon khâwngtuhai nuhmei umna LALPA ina pasal in- zawrhai umna in chu a ṭhiekpêk a."
"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.","Chun, Juda khawpuihaia in- thawk chun thiempu po po a ṭhuoi suok a, thiempuhai riminhnik rawna bâwlhmunhai chu Gebaa inthawka Beer-seba chenin a sukbohmang vawng a; khawpui kawtkhâr lûta vawitieng panga, khawpui awptu Josua kawtkhâr lûta kawtkhârhaia bâwlhmunhai chu a sukchim a."
"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren.","Bâwlhmun thiempuhai chu Jerusalema LALPA mâichâmah an hang fe ve naw a chu, an unauhai lai chun bei chawl ṭhanglo chu an fâk ve hlak a."
"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.","Chun, tukhawma an naunu amanih, an naupa amanih Molek puola meia an inlûttir ta nawna ding- in Hinnom thlahai ruoma Topheth chu a sukbo ta bawk a."
"And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.","Chun, LALPA in lûtnaa a in inhuonna sûnga lal in vêngtu Nathan-melek pindan bula Juda lal- haiin nisa ta dinga sakawr an pêkhai chu a sawn hmang vawng a; nisa tawlailîrhai chu a rawh a."
"And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, did the king break down, and beat them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.","Chun, Ahaz in sâwng chunga Juda lalhaiin mâichâm an siemhai le Manassein LALPA in inhuonna tuol sûnglai pahnia mâichâm a siemhai chu lal chun a sukchim a, a suknâwi vawng a, a nâwihai chu Kidron va- dungah a pei a."
"And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.","Chun, Jerusalem bul sietna tlâng changtieng panga Zidonhai pa- thien tirdakumtak Astoreth ta ding dâm, Moabhai pathien tirdakumtak Kemos ta ding dâm, Ammon thlahai pathien tirdakumtak Milkom ta ding dâm, Israel lal Solomonin bâwlhmun a siemhai chu lal chun a sukbo vawng a."
"And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.","Chun, lungphunhai chu a suk- nâwi vawng a, Aserahai chu a phûrthlûk a, chuong hmunhaia chun mihriem ru a sie tah a."
"Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.","Chu naw khawm chu Israelhai thil insuksuoltirtu Nebat naupa Jero- boamin Bethela mâichâm le bâwl- hmun a siem chu, chu mâichâm le bâwlhmun chen khawm chun a sukchim bawk a; chuongchun, bâwl- hmun chu a rawh a, a sir nâwi dap a, Asera chu a raw tah a."
"And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.","Chun, Josia chu a hei nghah a, tlânga thlânhai chu a hei hmuh a; chuongchun, thlâna ruhai chu a vân lâktir a, chuong thu lo hriltu Pathien miin a lo hril, LALPA thu ang ngeiin mâichâma chun a rawh a, a suksiet tah a."
"Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.","Chun, ama chun, “Saw ka hmu saw tu lungphûm am a nih a?” a ta. Khuoa mihai chun, “Pathien mi, Judai rama inthawka hung, Bethela mâichâm chunga i thilthawhai lo hrillâwktu thlân a ni saw,” an ta."
"And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.","Ama chun, “Tukhawma ieng- khawm law naw ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, tukhawma a ruhai chu Samari rama inthawka zâwlnei hung ruhai le chun iengkhawm an law nawh a."
"And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Jehovah to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.","Chun, Israel lalhaiin LALPA suklungsena an bâwl Samari ram khuohaia bâwlhmun inhai po po khawm chu Josia chun a sawn hmang a, Bethel khuoa a thaw ang chiein a thawpêk veh a."
"And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, chutaka bâwl- hmun thiempu umhai po po chu mâichâm chungah a that a; chuonga chun mihriem ruhai a rawh a, Jerusalemah a kîr nâwk tah a."
"And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.","Chun, lalin mi po po kuomah, “Hi thuthlung bua chuong ang hin LALPA in Pathien ta dingin Fekân Ruoiṭhe nei ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;","Israelhai chunga rorêltuhaiin ro an rêl chinah, Israel lalhai inlal sûng po po dâm, Juda lalhai inlal sûng po po khawma chuong angtaka Fekân Ruoiṭhe chu an la nei ngai nawh;"
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem.,lal Josia inlal kum sâwm le kum riet kuma chun chu Fekân Ruoiṭhe chu Jerusalem khuoah LALPA ta dingin an nei ta chau a nih.
"Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA ina thiempu Hilkiain a hmu lekhabua dân thu chuonghai kha a sukdet theina dingin khawhri aisânthiem zâwlhai, dawi- thiem dâm, pathien lim dâm, milim dâm, Judai ram le Jerusalema thil tirdakum an hmu hlakhai po po chu Josia chun a sukbo vawng bawk a."
"And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.","Mosie dân ang po poa lungril po po le thlarau po po le hrâtna po poa LALPA pawm ama ang hrim hrim a hmaa lal tukhawm an um nawh a, a hnunga khawm ama ang chu tukhawm an um nâwk ta bawk nawh."
"Notwithstanding, Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him.",Chuong sa khawm chun LALPA chun a lunginsenna nasatak Manas- sein a lo suklungsenna po po leia Juda chunga a lunginsenna chawk chu a la sukbo chuong nawh a.
"And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.","Chun, LALPAIN, “Israel ka sawn hmang ang hin Juda khawm hi ka hmu phâk loah sawn hmang vêng ka ta, hi khuo ka thlang Jerusalem ngei le, ‘Chutaka chun ka hming chu um a tih,’ ka ti in hi sukbo dai ka tih,” a ta."
"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Josia chanchin danghai, a thilthaw po pohai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai chanchin ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh-necoh slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.","Ân lal lai chun Aigupta lal Pharao-Neko chu Assuria lal do dingin Euphrates vadungah a hang feh a; chun, lal Josia chun ama chu a hang thawh a; chun, Pharao-Neko chun ama chu a hmu phingleh Megiddo khuoah a that tah a."
"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.","Chun, a mihai chun Megiddoa inthawk chun a ruong chu tawlailîrin an fepui a, Jerusalemah an lûtpui a, ama thlânah an phûm tah a.

Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.,"Jehoahaz chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni le kum thum a na; Jerusalemah thla thum ân lal a; a nu hming chu Hamutal, Libna khuoa Jeremia naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.","Chun, a pi le puhai thaw dân ang po po LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
"And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.","Chun, Pharao-Neko chun Jeru- salema rorêl thei ta lo dingin Hamath rama Ribla khuoah ân tângtir a; chun, an ram chu tangka talent za khat le rângkachak talent khat ân chawitir a."
"And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.","Chun, Pharao-Neko chun Josia nau Eliakim chu a pa Josia aia chun ân laltir a, a hming chu Jehoiakim tiin a thlengpêk a; Jehoahaz ruok chu a ṭhuoi dai a; Aigupta ramah a feh a, chutaka chun a thi tah a."
"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh.","Chun, Jehoiakim chun tangka le rângkachak chu Pharao chu a pêk phawt a, an ramhai chu Pharao thupêk angin a tangka pe dingin sie ân chawitir ve thung a; Pharao-Neko kuoma pêk dingin mi tin chawi ding tuk zât ang peiin chu rama mihai ta tangka le rângkachak ân chawitir a."
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.,"Jehoiakim chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni le kum nga a na; Jerusalemah kum sâwm le kum khat ân lal a; a nu hming chu Zebida, Ruma khuoa Pedaia naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.","Chun, a pi le puhai thaw dân ang po po LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.","Ân lal lai chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar a hung lien a, Jehoiakim chu a siehlawah kum thum a um a; chu hnunga chun a nghatsan a, a chungah a hel tah a."
"And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the prophets.","Chun, LALPAIN Kaldai pâwlhai, Suria pâwlhai, Moab pâwlhai, Ammon thla pâwlhai ama thaw dingin a tir suok tah a; a siehlaw zâwlneihai hmanga a hril LALPA thu anga Juda ram chu insuksiettir dingin."
"Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,","A hmu phâk nawa sawn ding thu chu LALPA thuin Juda ram chungah a hung tlung ta ngei a. Manasse suolnahai le a thilthaw po po le,"

So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.,"Chuongchun, Jehoiakim chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in a, chun, a naupa Jehoiakin chu ama aiawiin ân lal tah a."
"And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.","Chun, Aigupta lal chu a rama inthawkin a hung suok nâwk ta nawh a; Babulon lal chun Aigupta ram vadungtêa inthawka Euphrates vadung chena Aigupta lal ram huop po po a lâk ta sih a."
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.,"Jehoiakin chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwm le kum riet a na, Jeru- salema chun thla thum ân lal a; a nu hming chu Nehusta, Jerusalema Elnathan naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.","Chun, a pa thaw dân ang po po thawin, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.","Chuong lai chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar mihai chu Jerusa- lema chun an hang feh a, khuo chu an hang inhuol tah a."
"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;","Chun, chuonga a mihaiin an inhuol lai chun Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzar chu khuoa chun a hang feh a;"
"and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.","chuongchun, Juda lal Jehoiakin chu a nu hai dâm, a mihai dâm, a milienhai dâm, a upahai le chun Babulon lal kuomah an va suok a, chun, ân lal kum riet kumin Babulon lal chun a man tah a."
"And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.","Chun, LALPA hril ang khan, LALPA ina ro po po le lal ina ro po po chu a lâk suok a, LALPA biek ina Israel lal Solomonin rângkachak bûr le bêl a siemhai po po chu a sâtnawi vawng a."
"And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.","Chun, Jerusalema mi po po, mi lien po pohai, mi hrât huoisen ṭha po pohai dâm, sing khat zet, themthiem le thirsu po po salah a ṭhuoi vawng a; chu rama mi a pasie sie ti lo chu tukhawm an um ta nawh a."
"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.","Chun, Jehoiakin chu Babulon- ah a ṭhuoi a; chun, lal nu hai, lal nuhmei hai, a upahai dâm, chu rama mihrâthai chu Jerusalema inthawkin Babulonah salah a ṭhuoi a."
"And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.","Chun, Babulon lal chun pasal- ṭha po po sâng sari zet le, themthiem le thirsu sâng khat, mi hrât ṭha indo thei mi ṭhieu chu Babulonah salah a ṭhuoi vawng a."
"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.","Chun, a pa unau Mattania chu Babulon lal chun ama aiin ân laltir a, a hming chu Zedekia tiin a thlengpêk a."
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.,"Zedekia chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni le kum khat a na, Jerusa- lemah kum sâwm le kum khat ân lal a, a nu hming chu Hamutal, Libna khuoa Jeremia naunu a nih."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.","Chun, Jehoiakim thaw dân ang po po thawin LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
"For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.","LALPA lunginsenna leia a hmu phâk nawa a hnawthmang dai chenin Jerusalem le Juda chungah thil a hung tlung pei a nih; chun, Zedekia chu Babulon lal chunga chun a hel tah a."
"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.","Chun, ân lal kum kuo kum, thla sâwmna, ni sâwm ni takin Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chun a sipaihai po po leh Jerusalem khuo chu an hang thawh a, umhmun an hang khuor a; chun, kulin an inhuol vêl tah a."
So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.,"Chuongchun, lal Zedekia inlal kum sâwm le kum khatna chenin khuo chu an inhuol a."
"On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.","Thla lina, ni kuo ni chun khuo chu an ṭâm ta êm êm el a, chutaka mihai ta ding chun fâk ding hrim hrim a um ta nawh a."
"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.","Chun, khawpui kul chu a suk- âwng a; chuongchun, zânah indo mi po po chu lal huon bul, kul bang pahni inkâra kul kawtkhârah an tlânse ta vawng a: (Kaldaihai chun khuo chu an inhuol vêl a nih:) chun, lal chu Araba lampui tieng a feh a."
"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.","Nisienlakhawm, Kaldai sipaihai chun lal chu an hnawt a, Jeriko phaiah an hnawt phâk a; a sipaihai po po chun an tlândarsan ta vawng a."
"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.","Chuongchun, lal chu an man a, Babulon lal kuomah Ribla khuoah an ṭhuoi a; chun, a chungchâng an rêl a."
"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.","Chun, Zedekia naupasalhai chu a mithmu ngeiah an that a, Zedekia mithai chu an khel dawk a, kawl an inbun a, Babulonah an fepui tah a."
"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Babulon lal, lal Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwm le kum kuona, thla ngana, ni sari ni chun Babulon lal mi, vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebuzar-adan chu Jerusalemah a lût a;"
"And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.","LALPA in le lal in chu a rawh a; Jerusalem in po po, in ropui taktak- hai chu a rawh a."
"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu kuoma um Kaldai sipaihai po po chun Jerusalem vêla kul chu an sukchim vawng a."
"And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.","Chun, khawpui sûnga mi la um, inpehai, mipui la umhai chu vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebuzar-adan chun salah a ṭhuoi vawng a."
But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.,Chu rama pasie siehai ruok chu vêngtu pâwl hotu chun grêphrui en- kawltu ding le lo neitu dingin a mâksan a.
"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.","LALPA ina dâr banhai le, LALPA ina inṭhutna le dâr tuizêng chu Kaldaihai chun an sukkawi vawng a, a dârhai chu Babulon tieng an fepui a."
"And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.","Chun, bêlhai dâm, vutluohai dâm, khâwnvar enkawlna thilhai dâm, haihâwhai le dâr bûr le bêlhai po po, rawngbâwlna dinga an hmang- hai chu an lâk a."
"And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.","Chun, meilâknahai le maihûn- hai le chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun rângkachaka siemhai chu a rângka- chak chu a lâk a, tangkaruoa siemhai chu a tangkaruo chu a lâk a."
"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.",Solomonin LALPA in dinga a siem ban pahni le dâr tuizêng le inṭhutnahai chu; chuong hmang- ruohai po poa dâr bûk zât chu hriet ruol a ni nawh.
"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network.","Ban pakhat insâng tieng chu tawng sâwm le tawng riet a na, a sîpa chun dâr sungbâwk a um a; chu bâwk insâng tieng chu tawng thum a nih; a bâwk vêla chun ṭiel chikchek le theibufai lim a chuong a, dâr vawng a nih; chuong ang bawk chun ban pakhat khawm chu ṭiel chikchek a nih."
"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun thiempu lal Seraia le a dawttu Zephania le kawtkhâr vêngtu pa- thum a man a,"
"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.","chun, indo mihai chunga hotu pakhat leh, lal hmêl hmu phâk hlak, khawpui sûnga la um panga leh, mipuihai hming ziektu sipai hotu lekhaziektu leh, khawpui sûnga la um chu rama mi sâwmruk leh khawpui sûnga chun a man bawk a."
"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebu- zar-adan chun a ṭhuoi a, Babulon lal kuomah, Ribla khuoa chun a fepui a,"
"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.","Chun, Babulon lal chun Ha- math ram, Ribla khuoa chun a lo sukhlum a. Chuongchun, Juda chu a ram sûnga inthawka sala ṭhuoi suokin a lo um tah a."
"And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.","Chun, Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzar chun Judai rama mâksana umhai khawm chu an chunga chun Saphan naupa Ahikam naupa Gedalia chu awptu dingin a siem a."
"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.","Chuongchun, sipai pâwl hotu- hai po po le an rawihaiin Babulon lalin Gedalia chu awptu dingin a siem ti an hriet chun Mizpa khuoah Gedalia kuomah an feh a; chuonghai chu Nethania naupa Ismael hai, Karea naupa Johanan hai, Neto- phath mi Tanhumeth naupa Seraia hai, Maaka mi naupa Jaazania hai, an rawihai leh an nih."
"And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.","Chun, Gedalia chun chuonghai le, an rawihai kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm a, an kuomah, “Kaldaihai siehlawa um hi ṭi naw ro; hi rama hin um zing el unla, Babulon lal thu hnuoiah um ro, chuongchun, in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih,” a ta."
"But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.","Nisienlakhawm, thla sarinaa chun lal thla, Elisama naupa, Netha- nia naupa Ismael chu mi sâwm ṭhuoiin a feh a, Gedalia chu Mizpa khuoah Judahai le Kaldaihai a kuoma umhai le chun an thawh a, an that ta vawng a."
"And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.","Chuongchun, mi po po a chîn a lienin sipai hotuhai leh an suok a; Aigupta ramah an fe tah a, Kaldaihai chu an ṭi a nih."
"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;","Chun, Juda lal Jehoiakin sala ân tâng kum sâwmthum le kum sarina, thla sâwm le thla hnina, ni sâwmhni le ni sari niin Babulon lal Evil-merodakin ân lal ṭan kumin Juda lal Jehoiakin chu intângna ina inthawkin a ṭhuoi suok a,"
"and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,","a kuomah ṭhatakin thu a hril a, Babulona lalruol um vehai lalṭhung- pha chunga chun a lalṭhungpha chu a sie sâng ta bîk a."
and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:,"Ân tângna in silfênhai chu a thleng a, a dam sûng po chun a kuomah thlaithlêng a awt ve ta rawp a."
"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.","Chuongchun, a châwmna ding- in a hmu tâwk dingin lalin ni tin, a dam sûng po po chun chanvo a siempêk ta zing a."
"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.",Juda ram lal Jehosaphat inlal kum sâwm le kum riet kum chun Ahab naupa Jehoram chun Israelhai chungah Samari khuoah ro a rêl ṭan a; kum sâwm le kum hni lai ro a rêl a.
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.","Chuongchun, LALPA mithmuah thil suol chu a thawh a, nisienla- khawm, a nu le pa ang loin, Baal lungphun a pain a lo phun tahai chu a phawi hmang a."
"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.","Nisienlakhawm, Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolnaa Israel mihai ân suksuoltirnaa khan ân tûl tlat a, chutaka inthawk chun ân sie hmang ngai hrim hrim nawh a."
"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.","Chun, Moab lal Mesa chu berâm vai mi a na, Israel lal kuoma chun berâmte nuoi khat le berâmchal nuoi khat hmul chu leiman dingin a pêk hlak a."
"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Ahab a hung thi hnung chun Moab lal chu Israel lal chunga chun a hel tah a."
"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.","Chun, chu lai chun lal Jehoram chu Samari khuoa inthawk a suok a, Israel mihai po po chu a ko khâwm a."
"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.","Chun, a feh a, Juda lal Jeho- saphat kuoma chun, “Hi Moab lal chu ka chungah a hel a, Moab mihai chu do dingin i mi hung zui ding am a nih?” ti dingin mi a tir a. Chun, ama chun, “Fe vêng ka tih, kei le nang, ka mihai le i mihai chu pumkhat ei nih; ka sakawrhai le i sakawrhai khawm pumkhat an nih,” a ta."
"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Khawtieng lampui âm fêng ei ta?” a ta. Ama chun, “Edom thlalêr lampui tieng khan,” tiin a dawn a."
"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chu, Juda lal le Edom lal le chun an fe tah a, chuongchun, ni sari chu lampui inhêl zâwngin an fe tah a, anni zuitu mipuihai le an sahai ta ding chun tui a um ta nawh a."
"And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.","Chun, Israel lal chun, “E hei, LALPA chun hi lal pathumhai hi Moab mihai kuta pêk dingin a ko khâwm a ni ngei el,” a ta."
"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.","Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun, “Hitaka hin LALPA zâwlnei, ama hmanga LALPA thu ei indawn theina ding chu an um naw am a nih?” a ta. Chun, Israel lal siehlawhai laia mi pakhat chun, “Saphat naupa, Elisa, Elija kut tuia buok hlaktu chu hitaka hin a um,” tiin, a dawn a."
"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.","Chun, Jehosaphat chun, “LAL- PA thu chu ama kuoma chun a um a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israel lal le Jehosaphat le Edom khaw lal chu ama kuoma chun an zu fe tah a."
"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.","Chun, Elisa chun Israel lal kuoma chun, “Nang le kei hin ieng am inhmangna ei nei a? fe la, i nu le i pa zâwlneihai kuomah fe dai rawh,” a lo tih a. Chun, Israel lal chun a kuomah, “Ni lo e, LALPA chun hi lal pathum- hai hi Moab mihai kuta pêk dingin a mi ko khâwm a ni ta hi,” a ta."
"And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.","Chun, Elisa chun, “Sipaihai LALPA, a hmaa ka ngîrna hlak hringna chu sâlin ka hril a nih, Juda lal Jehosaphat hi inza naw lang chu nanga tieng hin a nghat khawm ngha naw ningah, a hmu khawm hmu naw bawk ka ti che."
"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, tuhin ṭingṭang keithiem mî mi hung ko pêk ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, ṭingṭang kei- thiemin a kei lai chun LALPA kut chu ama chunga chun a hung tlung tah a."
"And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.","Chun, ama chun, “LALPA chun, ‘Hi ruom po po hi khurin suksip vawng ro,’ a ti a nih."
"For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.","Chun, LALPA bawkin, ‘Thli hmu naw ti niu a, ruo khawm hmu bawk naw ti niu, amiruokchu, chu ruom chu tuiin hung sip a ta, nangni le in ranruol le in sahai chun tlân in tih,’ a ti a nih."
And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.,"Chun, hi thil hi LALPA mit- hmua chun thil chitê a na, chun, Moab mihai khawm chu in kutah pe bawk a ti cheu."
"And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.","Chun, khawpui kul nei po pohai le, khawpui ṭhahai po po chu suk- sieng in ta, thing ṭhahai po po chu phûrthlu bawk in ta, chun, tuikhur tuihnâr nei tinhai chu sukbit in ta, ram ṭha po pohai chu lungin dêngsip bawk in tih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.","Chun, zîngkâr thilinhlân hun vêl lai hin hieng hi a hung na, ngai ta, Edom ram tienga inthawk chun tui a hung luong a, a ram chun tuiin a hung sip tah a."
"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.","Chun, Moab mihai chun lalhai chu anni do dingin an hung ti an hriet phingleh, anni chu an inko khâwm tâwl a; râlthuoma inthuom thei taphawt le, a chungtieng pohai chu ramria chun an lo ṭhang a."
"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:","Chun, zîngkâr chun inhma- takin an tho a, nisa chun chu tui chu a hung el tle pup a; chuongchun, Moab mihai chun an hmazâwna tui chu thisen ang elin an hmuh a,"
"and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.","“Hi hi thisen a ni ngei hi, anni le anni chu an inthat tuoh a, lalhai chu sukhlum vawng an ni ta ngei a ni hi. Moab mihai, râllâk sum chu vân chu ro khai,” an ta."
"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.","Chun, Israel mihai riebûka an hung chun, Israelhai chu an tho a, Moab mihai chu an that a; chuong- chun, an hmaa chun an tlânse tah a, chuongchun, Moab mihai chu that peiin an ramah an hnawt lût tah a."
"And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.","Chun, khawpuihai chu an sukchim a, ram ṭhatna hmun poah mi tinin lung an pei seng a, an suksip pei a; chun, tuikhur hnâr nei po po chu an sukbit bawk a, thing ṭhahai po po chu an phûrthlûk a, Kir-hareseth khuoa lung chau an mâksan a; nisienla- khawm, vailungdêngna dêng mihai chun an va fe hêl a, an thaw tah a."
"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.","Chun, Moab lal chun ama ta dingin indona chu a nasa taluo ti a hriet phingleh Edom lal umna hmun chen chu va suktlang dingin kâwl- hnâm chawi mi za sari a ṭhuoi a, nisienlakhawm, an thei nawh a."
"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.","Chun, a naupasal upatak ama aia rorêl ding chu a lâk a, kul chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân ding- in ân hlân tah a. Israel mihai chunga chun lunginsenna nasatak chu a um tah a, chuongchun, ama chu an mâksan a, an rama chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.","Chun, zâwlnei naupasalhai nu- hmeihai laia nuhmei tu amani chu a khêk a, Elisa kuomah, “I siehlaw ka pasal chu a thi tah a, i siehlaw chun LALPA a ṭi hlak ti i hriet a, chuongchun, a leibatnapa a hung a, ka nauhai pahni suoka um dingin ama kuomah ṭhuoi a tum a nih,” a ta."
"And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.","Elisa chun a kuomah, “I ta dingin ieng am thawpêk ka ti che a? Mi hril rawh, i inah ieng am i nei a?” a ta. Chun, amanu chun, “I siehlawnu hin inah hriek bûr khat ti chau naw chu iengkhawm ka nei dêr nawh,” a ta."
"Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.","Chun, Ama chun, “Fe la, i tuolbâwmhai bêl po po, bêl ruokhai chu, haw khâwm ṭeu rawh; tlâwmte chu haw naw rawh."
"And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.","Chun, lût i ta, i naupasalhai le nang chu kawt inkhârkhum in ta, chuongchun, chuong bêl po pohaia chun hriek chu sung rawh, chun a sip chu sie hmang pei bawk la,” a ta."
"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.","Chun, a kuoma inthawk chun a fe tah a, a naupasalhai le ama chu kawt an inkhârkhum a; chun, bêlhai chu a kuomah an hung lâk a, ama chun a lo thun pei a."
"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.","Chun, bêlhai po po chu a sip phingleh, a naupa kuoma chun, “Bêl dang mi la hung lapêk rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Bêl dang a um ta nawh,” a ta.

"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.","Chun, a hung a, Pathien mi chu a hril a, ama chun a kuomah, “Fe la, hriek chu zawr la, i bat chu thung la, a la chuong chun nang le i naupa- salhai chu inchâwmna ro,” a lo tih a."
"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.","Chun, ni khat chu hieng hi a hung na, Elisa chu Sunem khuoah ân zin a, chu khuoa chun nuhmei nei- nungtak hi a um a, ama chun Elisa chu bu fa dingin a lo ko ṭâl hlak a.

"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.","Chun, ama chun a pasal kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi mipa mi hung sir rawp hlaktu hi Pathien mi inthieng a nih ti ka hriet a nih."
"Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.","Ka ngên che hi, in sâwng chîtê bâwl ei ta, chutaka chun khum leh, dawkân leh, ṭhungna le khâwnvar siena sieng ei ta, a hung poleh chu- taka a lût theina dingin,” a ta."
"And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.","Chun, ni khat chu chutieng chun a hung inzin a, pindana chun a lût a, a zâl tah a."
"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.","Chun, a siehlaw Gehazi kuoma chun, “Hi Sunamnu hi hung ko ta,” a ta. Chun, a hang ko hnung chun, a hmaa chun a hung ngîr a."
"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi nangin theitâwpin i mi duot a, ieng am thawpêk vêng ka ti cheh a? lal amanih, sipai hotu ama- nih biekpêk che i nuom am, tiin a kuoma hin hril ta,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Mâni chipui laia chêng ka nih annâwm,” a ta."
"And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.","Chun, ama chun, “Ieng am ei thawpêk ding a ni chu aw?” a ta. Gehazi chun, “Naupasal a nei dêr luo nawh a, a pasal khawm tar a ni tah,” tiin a dawn a."
"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.","Chun, ama chun, “Ama chu hung ko rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chu a hung ko chun kawtkhâra chun a ngîr a."
"And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.","Chun, ama chun, “Hi hun pha hin, hun a hung inlet nâwk pha chun naupasal pawm tâng i tih,” a ta. Chun, ama minu chun, “Ni lo e, pu, nang Pathien mi, i siehlawnu kuoma hin khêl hril naw rawh,” a ta."
"And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.","Chun, nuhmei chu ân rai a, a kuoma Elisain a hril hun, chu hun chu a hung tlung chun naupasal a nei tah a."
"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.","Chun, naupang chu a hung inṭhang lien a; ni khat chu a pa kuoma busîktuhai kuomah a fe veh a."
"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.","Chun, a pa kuoma chun, “Ka lu, ka lu,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a sie- hlaw kuoma chun, “A nu kuomah ama kha ṭhuoi rawh,” a ta."
"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.","Chun, ama chun a pawm a, a nu kuom a hang tlungpui chun, a nu khûp chungah nisa inding chen chu a ṭhung a; chun, a thi tah a."
"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.","Chun, a hang feh a, ama chu Pathien mi khum chunga chun ân zâl tah a; chun, kawt a khârkhum a, ama chu a suok tah a."
"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.","Chun, a pasal chu a ko a, “Ka ngên che hi, Pathien mi kuomah ka va tlâna ka hung kîr nâwk vak theina dingin siehlaw pakhat le sabengtung pakhat kha mi hung ngaituopêk rawh,” a ta."
"And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.","Chun, ama chun, “Vawisûn kher kher iengdingin am ama kuoma chun fêng i ta? thla thar a ni nawh a, Châwlni khawm a ni bawk si nawh a,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ṭha tho de nih,” a ta."
"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.","Chun, sabengtung chu a chuongpha a phah a, a siehlaw kuom- a chun, “Khal la, hmatieng fe pei rawh, ka tir chau naw che chun mi sukmuong naw rawh,” a ta."
"So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:","Chuongchun, a feh a, Karmel tlânga Pathien mi kuoma chun a hang fe tah a. Chun, Pathien mi chun ama chu hlataka a um lai chun a lo hmuh a, a siehlaw Gehazi kuoma chun, “En ta, sawtaka saw Sunamnu kha a nih,"
"run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.","tuhin ama tuok dingin tlân la, a kuomah, ‘Nang i dam de maw? i pasal kha a dam de maw? naupang kha a dam de maw?’ lo va ti rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Dam e,” tiin a lo dawn pei a."
"And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.","Chun, tlânga Pathien mi kuom a hung tlung chun a kephahai chu a chel tlat a. Gehazi chu ama hnawt- kieng ding chun a hung hnai a, ni- sienlakhawm, Pathien mi chun, “Tosan phawt el rawh, a sûngah a lungril a lungngai a nih, LALPA chun chu chu a thup a, ka kuomah a la hril hri si nawh,” a ta."
"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?","Ama chun a kuomah, “Pu, naupasal ka hni hrim che am a nih? Mi hlêm naw rawh, ka ti hrim a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.","Chun, ama chun Gehazi kuoma chun, “I dier kei ṭha la, i kutah ka hmawl kha chawi la fe raw khai; mi tukhawm în tuokpui chun chibai bûk naw la, chun, tukhawma chibai an bûk che khawma bûk thung naw rawh; chun, ka hmawl hi naupang hmai chunga chun innghat rawh,” a ta."
"And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.","Chun, naupang nu chun, “LALPA hringna le nanga hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, inthla naw ning che,” a ta. Chun, a tho a, a zui tah a."
"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.","Gehazi chun anni chu a lo hmakhal a, naupang hmai chunga chun hmawl chu a lo innghat a; nisienlakhawm, râwl hrim hrim le a dawn tina hrim hrim chu a um nawh a.

"And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.","Chun, Elisa chu in a hung lût chun ngai ta, naupang chu a thi tah a, khuma chun a lo zâl a."
"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.","Chuongchun, a va lût a, an pahni chun kawt ân khârkhum a, LALPA kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai tah a."
"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.","Chun, a hang feh a, naupang chunga chun a hang bawk a; chuong- chun, a bau chungah a bau, a mithai chungah a mithai, a kuthai chungah a kuthai a sieh a; chuongchun, nau- pang chunga chun a zuk bawk nâwk a; chun, naupang taksa chu a hung lum tah a."
"Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.","Chun, a hung kîr a, in sûnga chun hnungtieng hmatieng hin vawi- khat ân lawn a; chun, a hang feh a, a chunga chun a hang bawk nâwk a; chun, naupang chu vawi sari a hung insim a, chuongchun, a mit a hung meng tah a."
"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.","Chun, Gehazi chu a ko a, “Su- namnu kha hung ko rawh,” a ta. Ama chun nuhmei chu a hung ko a, a kuoma a hung lût chun, a kuomah, “I naupa kha pawm rawh,” a ta."
"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.","Chun, ama minu chu a va lût a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a, chun, a naupa chu a pawm a, a suok tah a."
"And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.","Chun, Elisa chu Gilgalah a fe nâwk a; chun, chu rama chun ṭâm nasatak a tlah a; zâwlnei naupa- salhai chu a hmaa chun an ṭhung a, a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Bel lientak inchuon la, zâwlnei naupasalhai ta dingin hmepawk suong rawh,” a ta."
"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.","Chun, mi pakhat chu ramah anhna zawng dingin a va feh a; grêp suok hrui hi a va hmuh a; chutaka ûmzâm chu a pawm khawp ṭeuin a hung inkhâwm bawk a, a hung a, a channawi a, hmepawk bêla chun a thlâk tah a; an hriet si nawh a."
"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.","Chun, mihai ta ding chun an fâk dingin an hung thur suok a, chun, an fâk lai chun, “Aw Pathien mi, bêla hin thina hri a um a nih,” tiin an khêk suok a. Chuongchun, an fâk thei ta nawh a."
"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.","Ama chun, “Chuong a ni chun, beiphit hung la ro,” a ta. Bêl sûnga chun a dêng lût a, “Mipui fâk dingin thur suok ta ro,” a tih a. Chuongchun, bêl sûnga chun thil ṭha naw hrim chu a um ta nawh a."
"And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.","Chun, Baal-salisaa inthawkin mi pakhat a hung a, Pathien mi chu ra hmasa bei, buṭei bei sâwmhni le bu thar vui a ipin a hung chawipêk a. Elisa chun, “An fâk dingin mipuihai kha pe rawh,” a tih a."
"And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.","A siehlaw chun, “Iengtin am hi hi mi za khat hmaa chun fâk dingin sieng ka ta?” a tih a. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “An fâk dingin mipuihai kuoma chun pe rawh, LALPA chun ‘Fâng an ta, fa sêng naw ni hai,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
"So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, an hmaa chun a sieh a, an fâk tah a, LALPA thu ang ngei chun an fâk sêng ta nawh a."
"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.","Chun, Suria ram lal sipai hotu Naaman chu LALPAIN Suria mihai sanhimna dinga a lo hmang hlak leiin a hotupa ngaia chun mi ropuitak le inzaumtak el a na, ama chu mi huoisen hrâttak a ni bawk a, nisienlakhawm, ama chu inphâr a ni tlat el a."
"And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.","Chun, Suria mihai chu a pâwl pâwlin râl an rêl a, Israel rama in- thawkin sal nuhmeitê pakhat hi an hung ṭhuoi a; ama chun Naaman nuhmei rawng chu a bâwl hlak a."
"And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.","Chun, a hotunu kuoma chun, “Ka pu hi Samari rama zâwlnei hmaa khan Pathien chun inumtir sien chu aw, ama chun ân phârna hi a sukdam el ding bah,” a ti hlak a."
"And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel.","Chun, Naaman chu a va lût a, “Israel rama nuhmeite khan, chuong- chun, khâng khan a tih,” tiin a pu chu a va hril tah a."
"And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.","Chun, Suria ram lal chun, “Va fe luo ta khai, Israel lal kuoma chun lekha thawn ka tih,” a ta. Chun, tangka talent sâwm le rângkachak tlang sâng ruk le silfên tuok sâwm leh a chawi a, a fe tah a."
"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.","Chun, lekhathawn chu Israel lal kuoma chun a hung chawi a, “Hi lekhathawn hi lo hmu ngei i ta, ngai ta, ka siehlaw Naaman ân phârna, sukdam dingin i kuomah ka hung tir a nih,” tiin a hril a."
"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.","Chun, Israel lal chun lekha- thawn chu a tiem phingleh, a puonhai a keithlêr a, “Hi mipa hin mi ân phârna sukdam dinga ka kuoma a hung tir hi sukdam ding le sukhlum dingin Pathien am ka nih? amiruok- chu, ngaituo ta u, ka ngên cheu hi, keia chunga insêlna a zawngzie hi en ta u,” a ta."
"And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Elisa Pathien mi chun Israel lal chun a puonhai a keithlêr ti a hriet phingleh lal kuoma chun mi a tir a, “Iengdinga i puonhai i keithlêr am a na? tuhin ama chu ka kuomah inhungtir la, chuongchun, Israel rama hin zâwlnei a um ti hrieng a tih,” a ta."
"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.","Chuongchun, Naaman chu a sakawrhai le a sakawr tawlailîrhai leh a va feh a, Elisa in kawtkhâr bula chun a ngîr a."
"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.","Chun, Elisa chun tirtâwn a tir a, “Fe la, Jordan vadungah vawi sari insil la, chun, i taksa chu a pâng- ngai hung nîng a ta, hung fai i tih,” a ta."
"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.","Nisienlakhawm, Naaman chu a lunginsen a, a fe hmang tah a, “Ngai ta u, ka kuoma hung suokin hung ngîr a ta, Pathien LALPA hming chu lamin a kut chu phar vêlin ân phârna lai chu a sukdam ding rawi am ka sawn a;"
"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.","Damaska vadung hieng Abana le Pharpar hai hi Israel rama vadunghai nêk chun a ṭha lem a ni naw am a nih?

"And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?","Chun, a siehlawhai chu an hung hnai a, a kuomah, “Pa, zâwlnei chun thil khirkhântak thaw dingin tir sienla che, i thaw naw ding am a nih? ‘Insil la, lo inthieng ta rawh,’ a ti kha ti âwmtak hrim a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.","Chun, a zu feh a, Pathien mi hril ang chun Jordan vadunga chun vawi sari a zûn phûm a; a taksa chu naupang chitê pang angin a hung um tah a, a hung inthieng vawng tah a."
"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.","Chun, Pathien mi kuoma chun ama le a ruolhai po po leh an hung kîr nâwk a, a hmaa chun a ngîr a; ama chun, “Tuhin ngai ta, hnuoi chung po poah, Israel rama chau naw hin chu Pathien a um nawh ti ka hriet tah; chuleiin, tuhin ka ngên che a nih, i siehlaw thilpêk hi la rawh,” a ta."
"But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “A hmaa ka ngîrna hlak, LALPA hming sâlin ka hril a nih, iengkhawm la naw ning,” a ta. Chun, la dingin a ti ṭâl a, nisienlakhawm, a sêl tlat a."
"And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.","Chun, Naaman chun, “Chuong a ni naw leh, ka hni che hi, i siehlaw hi sabengtung lien chi phur hni pil mîn lâktir rawh, i siehlaw hin tuta hnung chu LALPA kuoma chau naw chun inthâwina amanih, pumraw- hmang thilinhlân amanih pathien dang kuoma hrim hrim kân hlân ta naw ding a ni sih a."
"In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.","Hi thila hin i siehlaw chu LALPAIN ngaidam raw se, ka pu hi ka kut ringsan a, chibai bûk dinga Rimmon ina a lût a, Rimmon ina ka kûn chun, Rimmon ina ka kûn vena thua chun, LALPAIN i siehlaw hi ngaidam raw se,” a ta."
"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin fe rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, a kuoma inthawk chu a suok nâwk a, ieng chen amani chu a fe hman tah a."
"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi siehlaw Gehazi chu, “Khâwm, ka pu hin Suria mi Naaman hi a thil hung chawihai hi la loin ân fetir nâwk el a, LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, va hnawt ka ta, ieng amanih bêk va lapêk ka tih a,” a ta."
"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?","Chuongchun, Gehazi chun Naaman chu a hnawt tah a. Naaman chun tuin amanih a hung hnawt a hei hmu chun lo biek tumin a tawlailîra inthawk chun a ṭum a, “Ṭha tieng thu a ni de maw?” a ta."
"And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.","Ama chun, “Ṭha tieng thu nih e.

"And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.","Naaman chun, “Talent hni hi la raw khai,” a ta.

"And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.","Chun, tlâng a va tlung chun a lâkpêk a, in sûnga hin a sieh a; chun, chuonghai chu ân fetir a, an fe tah a."
"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.","Ama ruok chu a va lût a, a pu hmaa chun a va ngîr a.

"And he said unto him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “A be ding chea a tawlailîra inthawka mi hung ṭum lai khan ka lungril chu i kuomah a fe ve pei a ni naw am a nih?

"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.","Chuongchun, Naaman inphâr- na khan man a ti cheh a, kumkhuoin i thlahai khawm man pei a tih,” a ta.

"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.","Chun, zâwlneihai naupasalhai chun Elisa kuomah, “En ta hi, i hmaa kan ṭhung khâwmna hi kan ta dingin ân têp taluoh a."
"Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.","Jordan vadungah zu fêng kan ta, chutaka thing chu zu la seng kan ta, kan ṭhung khâwmna ding chutaka chun zu siem kan tih aw?” an ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Fe ta unla,” a ta."

"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.","Chuongchun, anni lai chun a fe ve tah a. Chun, Jordan vadung an tlung chun thing chu an hei phûr a."
"But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.","Chun, mi pakhatin thing a hei phûr lai tak hin, a hreipui chu tuiah a tla tah a; chun, ama chun “E khai, pu, kan haw a ni bah,” tiin a khêk tah a."
"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place.

"And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.","Chun, ama chun, “La raw le,” a ta. Chuongchun, a hei ban a, a lâk tah a."
"Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.","Suria lal chun Israelhai chu a hung rûn a, “Chulai hmun khalai hmuna chun inchân ei tiu,” tiin a upahai chu a rawn a."

"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.","Chun, Israel lal chun Pathien miin a lo hril ta hmun chu a vân enthlittir hlak a; chutaka chun vawi hni vawi khat chau khawm ni loin, a lo inhumhim hlak a."
"And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?","Chuongchun, chu thua chun Suria lal lungril chu a lunginzîng hleh a; chun, a upahai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Eini laia atu hîm Israel lal tienga ṭhang in mi hril nuom naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
"And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.","Chun, upahai laia mi pakhat chun, “Tukhawm kan ṭhang nawh ie, pu, aw laltak, Israel rama um zâwlnei Elisa hin i pindan sûngrila i hrilhai hi Israel lal a hril pei a ni lem a nih,” a ta."
"And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.","Chun, ama chun, “Khâwlai am a um a, va zawng ta u, inmantir ka tih,” a ta. Chun, “Ngai ta, Dothan khuoah a um,” tiin an hril a."
"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.","Chuongchun, sakawr dâm, taw- lailîr dâm, sakawr tamtakhai chu- taka chun a tir a, zânah an va feh a, khuo chu an inhuol ta mup el a."
"And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?","Chun, Pathien mi siehlaw chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, a va suok chun, ngai ta, sipaihai chun sakawr leh, tawlailîr leh khuo chu an lo inhuol mup el a.

"And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.","Chun, ama chun, “Ṭi da ta la, anni tienga ṭhang nêk chun, eini tienga ṭhang an tam lem annâwm,” a ta."
"And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.","Chun, Elisa chu a ṭawngṭai a, “LALPA, a hmu theina dingin, a mit hung sukvarpêk ta khai,” a ta.

"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.","Chun, ama tieng an hung thla chun, Elisa chun LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a, “Hienghai hi an mit hung sukdelpêk tâwl ta,” a ta.

"And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.","Chun, Elisa chun an kuomah, “Hi chu lampui a ni nawh a, khuo khawm a ni bawk nawh a; mi zui unla in mi zawngpa kuoma chun ṭhuoi ka ti cheu,” a ta.

"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.","Chun, Samari khaw sûng an hang tlung chun Elisa chun, “LALPA, hieng hai hin an hmu theina dingin an mithai hung sukvarpêk rawh,” a ta.

"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?","Chun, Israel lal chun anni chu a hmu chun Elisa kuomah, “Pa, that tâwl ka ti,? That tâwl ka ti?” a ta."
"And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “That lo e, i kâwlhnâm le i thalngula i sal manhai chu i that ding am a nih?

"And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.","Chuongchun, fâk ding nasatak a buotsaipêk a; chun, an fâk a, an dâwn zo chun ân fetir nâwk ta vawng a, an pu kuom tieng an fe nâwk tah a.

"And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.","Chu hnunga chun Suria lal Benhadad chun a sipai po po a ko khâwm vawng a, Samari khuo a hang inhuol a."
"And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.","Chun, Samari khuoa chun ṭâm a nasa êm el a; ngai ta, an inhuol tlat a, sabengtung lu hi tangka sâwm- rietin an zawr a; chun, vaṭhu êk hi kab hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat tangka pangaah an zawr hiel bawk a."
"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.","Chun, Israel lal chu kul kho- tlânga a fe lai hin nuhmei pakhat hin, “Aw laltak ka pu, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” a lo tih a."
"And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?","Chun, ama chun, “LALPAIN a ṭhangpui nghâl naw che leh keiin khâwlaia inthawkin am hang ṭhang- pui ka ti cheh a?

"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ieng am i ti a ni leh?” a ti nâwk a.

"So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.","Chuongchun, ka naupa chu kan suong a, kan fâk tah a; chun, a zînga chun keiin a kuomah, ‘I naupa chu ei fâk dingin thaw ve thung raw leh,’ ka tih a, a naupa chu a thuphmang bîk el tah a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall); and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.","Chun, lal chun chu nuhmei thuhril chu a hriet chun a puon a keithlêr tah a, (kul khotlânga a fe lai a nih) chun, mipuihai chun an hang en a, ngai ta, a pang depa chun saiip puon hi a lo sil zing a."
"Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.","Chuongchun, ama chun, “Vawi- sûn hin Saphat naupa Elisa chun a lu a la put hrim hrim chun, Pathien chun a law law mi law el raw se, chu nêka nasa hman khawm chun,” a ta."
"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?","Elisa chu a inah a ṭhung a, upahai khawm chu an ṭhung veh a, chun, laltak chun a kuomah mi pakhat a tir a, nisienlakhawm, a mi tir chun a kuom a hung tlung hmain upahai kuoma chun, “Hi tuolthattupa naupa hin ka lu la ve dingin mi a hung tir ti in hriet ve am?

"And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?","Chun, chuonga anni a la biek lai mêk chun ngai ta, a mi tir chu a hung tlung thla tah a; chun, laltak chun, “Ngai ta, hi thil ṭha naw hi, LALPA hung tir a ni hi, LALPA chu iengding- in am la nghâk ta rawp ka tih a?” a ta."
"And Elisha said, Hear ye the word of Jehovah: thus saith Jehovah, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.","Elisa chun, “LALPA thu hi lo hre ta u, LALPA chun, hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Zingah hieng tik phât vêla hin Samari kul kawtkhâr bula chun beiphit indi mi tekhâwng khat chu shekel khatah zawr an ta, buṭei tekhâwng hni chu shekel khatah,’ tiin,” a ta."
"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?","Chun, kul lûtna kawtkhâr bula chun inphâr pali an um a; anni chun, “Iengdinga thi nghâk ela ei inṭhung zing am a na?"
"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.","‘Khaw sûnga hin lût ei tiu khai,’ ti ding ni inla, khaw sûng an ṭâm a, ei va thi el âwm sih a; chun, hitaka hin ṭhung zing inla, ei thi tho tho bawk âwm sih a.

"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.","Chuongchun, Suria mihai riek- hmuna fe ding chun thimbut hin an inthawk suok tah a; chun, Suria mi- hai riekhmun tawntir an va tlung chun, ngai ta, tukhawm an lo um nawh a."
"For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.","LALPAIN Suria sipaihai chu tawlailîr ri dâm, sakawr ri dâm, sipai tamtak ri dâm ân hriettir a nih, chuongchun, “Ngai ta u, Israel lal hin, Hit lalhai, Aigupta lalhai hi eini mi thaw ding hin a hung ruoi a ni hi,” tiin an inbiek a."
"Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.","Chuongchun, an tho a, inthim lai chun an tlânse tah a, an puon inhai, an sakawrhai, an sabengtunghai le an riekhmun chu a um ngai ngaiin an tlânsan a, an tlânse ta rak el a."
"And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.","Chun, chuong inphârhai chun riekhmun tawntir an va tlung chun puon in pakhata hin an va lût a, an fâkin an dâwn a, chutaka tangkaruo dâm, silfênhai chu an lâk a, an va thuphmang a; chun, an va kîr nâwk a, puon in dangah an lût nâwk a, chu- taka mi khawm chu an lâk a, an va thuphmang nâwk a."
"Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.","A nakie chun, “Ei sukdik naw tawp el a, vawisûn hi chanchin lâwm- um intlun ni a nih, eini hi ei to zing el a; khawvar ei nghâk chun hrem tuok el ei tih, chuongchun, thaw ta u, lal sûnghai va hril ei tiu,” tiin an in- biek a."
"So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.","Chuongchun, khaw kawtkhâr vêngtu chu an va ko a, “Suria mihai riekhmunah kan va feh a; chun, ngai ta, tukhawm an lo um nawh a, mihriem riva hrim hrim khawm a um nawh a, sakawrhai le sabengtunghai chau a lo inthlung a, puon inhai khawm chu a um ngai ngaiin a um zing el,” tiin an hril a."
And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s household within.,"Chun, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu a ko a; chun, anni chun lal in sûnga mihai chu an va hril a."
"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.","Chun, lal chu zâna chun a tho a, a upahai kuoma chun, “Suria mihai mi thaw dân hi hril ka ti cheu, Ei phîngṭâmzie hi an hriet a, chuleiin, ‘Khawpuia inthawka an hung suok chun a hringin lo man ei ta, khaw- sûnga chun lût el ei tih,’ tiin rama inbihmang dingin an riekhmun an suoksan a ni hi,” a ta."
"And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed); and let us send and see.","Chun, a upa pakhat chun a dawn a, “Khawpuia sakawr um sun panga hi tuhai amanih inṭhuoitir raw khai, (ngai ta, Israel mipuihai, a la damhai po po ang an ni tho tho va, ngai ta, Israel mipuihai thia ngaihai ang bawk an ni tho tho annâwm;) chuongchun, va tir phawt ei tiu khai,” a ta."
"They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.","Chuongchun, tawlailîr keitu sakawr pahni an ṭhuoi a; chun, lal chun, “Va en phawt ta u,” tiin, Suria sipaihai hnawt ding chun a tir a."
"And they went after them unto the Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.","Chun, Jordan vadung chenin an va hnawt a, chun, ngai ta, Suria mi- hai chun an inhmaw leia an pei silfên- hai le thuomhnawhai chu lampui intluonin a um zel zul el a.

"And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.","Chun, mipuihai chu an va suok a, Suria mihai riekhmun chu an va dap ta rak a.

"And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.","Chun, lal chun sipai hotu a kut a ihung ringsan kha kul kawtkhâr vêngtuah a ruot a; chun, mipuihai chun kul kawtkhâr bula chun an chîl ta nuoi nuoi el a, Pathien miin a kuoma lal a hung thla laia a lo hril ang khan a thi tah a."
"And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;","Hieng hi a hung na, Pathien mi chun lal kuomah, “Zingah hieng tik phât hin Samari kul kawtkhâr bul- ah buṭei tekhâwng hni chu shekel khatah zawr an ta, beiphit indi mi tekhâwng khat chu shekel khatah,” a tih a;"

"Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for Jehovah hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.","Chun, Elisa chun a naupa a sukdampêk nuhmei kuoma chun, “Tho la, nang le i sûnghai leh, in um theina hmun hmunah va um hri ro; LALPAIN ṭâm ân tlâktir ding a nih; hi rama hin kum sari sûng zet a tla nghe nghe ding a nih,” tiin a lo hril tah a."
"And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chu a tho a, Pathien mi thu ang chun a thawh a, a sûnghai le chun Philistin mihai ram- ah kum sari an va um tah a."
"And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.","Chun, kum sari ân vawi hnung chun chu nuhmei chu Philistin mihai rama inthawk chun a kîr nâwk a; a in le lo chu lal kuoma hni dingin a va feh a."

"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.","Chun, mi pakhat thi ta hnung a sukdam nâwk thu lal chu a lo hril lai tak chun, ngai ta, a naupa a suk- dampêk nâwk nuhmei chun a in le lo chu lal a hung hni veh a.

"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?","Chuongchun, Hazael chu ama be ding chun a va feh a, lâwmman dingin Damaska khuoa thil ṭha tinrêng sanghâwngsei sâwmli phur a chawi a, a hmaa chun a va ngîr a, “I naupa Benhadad, Suria lalin, ‘Ka na hi ka ṭha suok nâwk ding am?’ ti dingin i kuoma hin a mi hung tir a nih,” a ta."

"And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?

"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.","Chuongchun, Joram chu Zair khuoah a tawlailîrhai po po leh a va feh a; chun, zâna chun ân thawk suok a, anni inhuoltu Edom mihai le an tawlailîr chunga hotuhai chu a va thaw tah a; chun, mihai chu an puon in tiengahai an tlân ta vawng a."
So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.,"Chuongchun, Edomhai chu tu chen hin Judahai chunga chun an la hel ta zing a nih. Chuong lai vêk chun Libna khuo khawm an lo hel veh a."
"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chun, Joram chanchin danghai le a thilthawhai po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Joram chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in tah a, a pi le puhai lai David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; a naupa Ahazia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.,Israel lal Ahab naupa Joram inlal kum sâwm le kum hni kum chun Juda lal Jehoram naupa Ahazia chu ân lal ṭan a.
Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.,"Ahazia chun, ro a rêl ṭan lai chun kum sâwmhni le kum hni mi a nih; chun, Jerusalem khuoa chun kum khat ro a rêl a. A nu hming chu Athalia, Israel lal Omri naunu a nih."
"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.","Ahab sûnghai lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, Ahab sûnghai angin LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak; Ahab sûnghai mâkpa a ni sih a."
And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.,"Ama chu Ahab naupa Joramin Ramoth-gilead khuoa Suria lal Hazael a hang thawnaa chun a ṭhang veh a; chun, Suria mihai chun Joram chu an lo inhliem a."
"And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.","Chun, lal Joram chu Suria lal Hazael an thawnaa Suria mihaiin Rama khuoa an lo inhliem chu Jezreel khuoah insukdam dingin a kîr nâwk tah a. Chun, Juda lal Jehoram naupa Ahazia chu Ahab naupa Joram a nat lei chun kan dingin Jezreel khuoa chun a zu feh a."
"And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.","Chun, zâwlnei Elisa chun zâwl- neihai naupasalhai laia pakhat chu a ko a, a kuomah, “I dier kei la, hi hriek bâwm hi chawi la, Ramoth- gilead khuoah va fe rawh;"
"And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber.","i va tlung chun Nimsi naupa Jehosaphat naupa Jehu chu va zawng suok la, pindan sûngrilah lûtpui la."
"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.","Chuongchun, hriek bâwm hi la la, a lua chun buok la, ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih; Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek ka nâl che, tiin,’ ti rawh. Chuongchun, kawt hawng la, tlân suok el rawh, um sâwt loin,” a ta."
"So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl, zâwlnei tlangvâl chu Ramoth-gileada chun a fe tah a."
"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.","Chun, a va tlung chun, ngai ta, sipai hotuhai an lo ṭhung khâwm a; chun, ama chun, “Sipai hotu, i kuomah thu incha hril ding ka nei,” a ta. Chun, Jehu chun, “tu tak kuoma hin am a nih a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Nanga kuoma hin a nih, sipai hotu,” a ta."
"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel.","Chun, a tho a, ina chun a lût a; chun, a lua chun hriek chu a buok a, a kuomah, “LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘LALPA mipuihai, Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek ka nâl che."
"And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.",Ka siehlaw zâwlneihai thisen le LALPA siehlaw po pohai thisen phuba chu Jezebela inthawka ka lâk theina dingin i pu Ahab sûnghai chu sukbohmang vawng i tih.
"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel.","Ahab sûnghai po po chu bohmang vawng an ta; Ahaba inthawk hin naupasal taphawt chu Israel rama mi khuokhir amanih, khuokhir naw amanih khawm ka sukbohmang ding a nih."
"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.","Chun, Ahab sûnghai chu Nebat naupa Jeroboam sûnghai le Ahija naupa Baasa sûnghai angin siem ka tih."
"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.","Chun, uiin Jezebel chu Jezreel khaw kul bula chun fâng an ta, a phûmtu ding hrim hrim um naw ni hai,’ tiin,” a ta."
"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was.","Chuongchun, kawt a hawng a, a tlân suok tah a. Chun, Jehu chu a pu upahai lai chun a hung suok a; pakhat chun a kuomah, “Ṭha tieng thu am a nih? Kha invêtpa kha i kuoma iengtiziea hung am a ni leh?” a ta. Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In hriet mi a na, a thu hril khawm kha in hriet annâwm,” a ta."
"And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel.","Anni chun, “Hre lo ve a, mi hang hril ta khai” an ta. Ama chun, “Hieng ang tak hin a mi ti a ni kha tie! ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek ka nâl che, tiin,’” a ta."
"Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.","Chuongchun, mi tinin an puon chu an hlîp hmawk hmawk a, kai- lâwn chunga chun an phapêk ta seng a, “Jehu chu lal a ni tah,” tiin taw- tawrâwt an mût tah a."
"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;","Chuongchun, Nimsi nau Jeho- saphat naupa Jehu chun Joram chu a phier rûk tah a. (Suria lal Hazael leiin Joram le Israelhai po po chun Ramoth-gilead khuo chu an vêng a;"
"but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.","lal Joram ruok chu Suria lal Hazael le an inthawnaa Suria mi- haiin an inhliem kha Jezreel khuoah insukdam dingin a kîr nâwk kha.) Chun, Jehu chun, “Keia tienga ṭhang in ni chun Jezreel khuoah hieng thu hi hril dingin tukhawm khuoa in- thawk hi insuoktir naw ro,” a ta."
"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.","Chuongchun, Jehu chu tawlai- lîrah a chuong a, Jezreel khuoah a feh a, Joram chu chutaka chun a zâl a na; chun, Juda lal Ahazia khawm Joram chu kan dingin a zu feh a."
"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?","Chun, Jezreel kula chun râl- vêng a ngîr a, ama chun Jehu rawi hung chu a hang hmuh a, “Mi tamtak el ka hmuh ie,” a ta. Chun, Joram chun, “Sakawr chung chuong mi anni chu tuok dingin va tir la, ‘Ṭha tieng thu am a nih?’ va ti raw hai seh,” a ta."
"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.","Chuongchun, mi pakhat sakawr chunga chuong hi a tuok dingin a va feh a, “Lalin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ṭha tieng thu am a nih?’ tiin” a tih a. Chun, Jehu chun, “Ṭha tieng thu chu nanga lo hriet ding ieng am a um a? Ka hnunga hin va fe ve el rawh,” a tih a. Chun, râlvêngtu chun, “Ei mi tir chun an kuom chu a va tlung ngei a, nisienlakhawm, a hung kîr nâwk ta dêr nawh,” tiin a hril a."
"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.","Chuongchun, mi pakhat sakawr chunga chuong hi a tir nâwk a, ama khawm chun an kuom a va tlung a, “Lalin hieng ang hin a tih: ‘Ṭha tieng thu am a nih?’ tiin,” a tih a. Chun, Jehuin a dawn a, “Ṭha tieng thu chu nanga lo hriet ding ieng am a um leh? Ka hnunga hin va fe ve el rawh,” a ta."
"And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.","Chun, râlvêngtu chun, “Ama khawma an kuom chu a va tlung ngei a, ama khawm chu a hung kîr nâwk ta dêr nawh; chun, a khal dân khawm saw Nimsi naupa Jehu khal dân chie a nih, mi invêt ang elin a khal hlak a nih,” a ta."
"And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.","Chun, Joram chun, “Buotsai ta u,” a ta. Chun, a tawlailîr chu an buotsai a. Chun, Israel lal Joram le Juda lal Ahazia chu mâni tawlailîr ve vein an va suok a, Jehu chu tuok dingin an va feh a; Jezreel mi Naboth huonah an va hmuh a."
"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?","Chun, Joramin Jehu a hei hmu chun, “Ṭha tieng thu am a nih, Jehu?” a hei tih a. Chun, ama chun a lo dawn a, “I nu Jezebel hin uiret le dâwi a chîng sûng chu ṭha tieng thu ieng am um thei a ta?” a ta."
"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.","Chun, Joram chun a kei her a, a tlân a, Ahazia kuomah, “Inhlêmna a um a ni hi, Ahazia,” a ta."
"And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.","Chun, Jehu chun a thalngul chu a theitâwpin a kuoi a, Joram dâr le dâr inkâra chun a kâp a, thal chu a lungah a lût thleng a, a tawlailîra chun a awp ta rawk a."
"Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:","Chuongchun, Jehu chun a sipai hotu Bidkar kuomah, “Pawm la Jezreel mi Naboth huon hmunah pei thla rawh, kha hmaa a pa Ahab hnunga ei pahnia ei chuong hmun- khat laia LALPAIN hi phur hi ama chunga ân nghat hrim a ni kha;"
"Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of Jehovah.","LALPAIN, ‘Zâni khan Naboth thisen le a naupasalhai thisen ka hmu ngei annâwm,’ a ti kha; chun, LALPAIN, ‘Hi hmun ngeia hin ka thung ding che a nih,’ a ti nâwk kha. Chuongchun, LALPA thu ang chun pawm la, hi hmuna ngei hin pei thla rawh,” a ta."
"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: and they smote him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.","Nisienlakhawm, Juda lal Ahazia chun chu chu a hmu chun, huon in tieng a tlân tah a. Chun, Jehu chun a hnawt a, “Ama khawm tawlailîra khan that nghâl ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, Ibleam khaw kâwl, Gur hang fenaa chun an thawh a. Chun, Megiddo khuoah a tlân lût a, chutaka chun a thi tah a."
"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.","Chun, a mihai chun Jerusalem khuoah tawlailîrin an fepui a, ama thlânah a pi le puhai lai David khawpuiah an phûm tah a."
And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.,Ahab naupa Joram kum sâwm le kum khat ân lal kumin Ahazia chu Judahai chungah ân lal ṭan a nih.
"And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.","Chun, Jehu chu Jezreel khuo a va lût chun Jezebel chun a lo hriet a; chuongchun, a mithai a lo nâl a, a sam dâm a lo chei a, tukvera hin a lo dâk a."
"And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master’s murderer?","Chun, Jehu chu kul kawtkhâra a hung lût lai takin, “Ṭha tieng thu am a ni, nang, mâni puhai thattu, Zimri?” a lo tih a."
"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.","Chun, ama chu tukver tieng ngha chun a hung dâk a, “Tu am ka tienga ṭhanghai chu? Tuhai am?” a ta. Mi tillâk pahni amanih, pathum amani hi ama tieng ngha chun an hung dâk a."
"And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.","Chun, ama chun, “Hung the thla ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, an the thlâk a, a thi chun bang le sakawrhai chu a khieng nuol el a; chun, ama chun a lo chîl a."
"And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.","Chun, a lût a, a fâkin a dâwn a; “Ṭawngsephurnu kha va ngaiven unla, va phûm ro, lal naunu a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.","Chun, phûm dingin an va feh a; nisienlakhawm, a luru dâm, a ke bâwr dâm, a kutpha bâwr dâm ngawt naw chu an va hmu ta nawh a."
"Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;","Chuongchun, an hung nâwk a, an hung hril a. Chun, ama chun, “Hi hi LALPAIN a siehlaw Tisbe mi Elija hmanga, ‘Jezreel kul bula chun uiin Jezebel sa hi la fâng a ta,"
"and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.","Jezebel ruong chu Jezreel khaw kul bulah huona êk ang el la nîng a tih; chuongchun, hi hi Jezebel a ni hi aw, an ti nawna dingin,’ ti thu a hril kha a ni hi,” a ta."
