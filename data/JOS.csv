"Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,","LALPA siehlaw Mosie chu a thi hnung chun, Mosie rawngbâwltu Nun naupa Josua kuoma chun LALPAIN,"
"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.","“Ka siehlaw Mosie chu a thi tah a; tho la, nang le hieng mipui po pohai le hin Jordan hi kân unla, anni Israel thlahai ngei ka ipêk rama chun fe ro."
"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.","Mosie kuoma ka hril ta ang khan, in kephaa in isir taphawt chu ka pêk vawng cheu a nih."
"From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.","Thlalêra inthawk le hi Lebanon tlânga inthawka Euphrates vadung, vadung lientak chen, Hit mihai ram po po, nisa tlâkna tieng tuisuoriet lientak chen in ramri nîng a ta."
"There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.","I dam sûng po po chun tukhawm i hmaah ngîr thei naw ni hai a, Mosie kuoma ka um ang khan i kuoma khawm ka um ve ding a nih; inhlâw- samtir naw ning cheh a, mâk khawm mâksan naw tawp ka ti che."
Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.,"Hrâttak le huoitakin um rawh, inkhâma an thlatuhai pêk ka lo tiem ta ram kha anni hi în hluotir ding a ni sih a."
"Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.","Ka siehlaw Mosiein dân po po zâwm dinga a pêk che kha zâwm tlat dingin hrâttak le huoitakin um phawt el rawh. I fena taphawta i tluongtlung peina dingin i changtieng amanih, i vawitieng amaniha khawm pêtsan dêr naw rawh."
"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.","Hi dân bu hin i bâu chu suoksan hlek naw sienla, chu thu ziekhai po po chu i zâwm tlat theina dingin sûn le zânin i ngaituo ding a nih, chuong- chun, i lampuihai chu suktluong pei i ta; i hung tluongtlung pei ding a nih. Thu ka pêk che a ni naw am a nih?"
"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.","Hrâttak le huoitakin um rawh; ṭi naw la, zâm bawk naw rawh, LALPA i Pathien chu i fena taphawtah i kuomah a um pei ding annâwm,” tiin, a hril a."
"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,","Chuongchun, Josua chun mipui hotuhai chu thu a pêk a,"
"Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.","“Riebûk chu va fang unla, mi- puihai kuoma chun, ‘Fâk dinghai buot- sai ro khai, ni thum sûngin LALPA in Pathienin ram hluo ding a pêk cheu hi hluo dingin Jordan vadung hi in kân ding a nih,’ tiin thu pe ro,” tiin."
"And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,","Chun, Reuben mihai le, Gad mihai le Manasse hnam zâtvehai kuoma chun Josua chun,"
"Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.","“LALPA in Pathienin châwlna a pêk cheu a, hi ram hi a la pêk ding cheu a nih, tia LALPA siehlaw Mosien thu a pêk cheu hi hre zing unla."
"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;","In nuhmeihai, in nau le tehai le in ran ruolhai hi chu Jordan râla Mosien ram a lo pêka cheu chun um an ta; nangni mi hrât huoihai po chu inrâlthuomin lo kai hmasâng in ta, in unauhai lo ṭhangpui in ta;"
"until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.","LALPAIN in unauhai khawm chu nangni ang bawka châwlna a pêka, LALPA in Pathienin ram a pêk chu anni khawma an hluo ve hma- khat chun; chuongchun, LALPA sie- hlaw Mosien Jordan râl, nisa suokna tieng ram in puola a lo pêk ta cheu tieng chun kîr nâwk in ta, in la hluo ding a nih,” tiin, a hril a."
"And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.","Anni chun Josua chu an dawn a, “Thaw dinga i thu mi pêkhai po po chu thaw pei kan tih."
"According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.","Kawng iengkima Mosie thu kan zâwm pei hlak ang khan, i thu khawm zâwm pei kan tih. LALPA i Pathien chu Mosie kuoma a um hlak ang khan i kuoma hin um ve phawt sienla."
"Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.","Tukhawm i thupêk chunga hela, thu i pêk taphawt zâwm nuom lo chu sukhlum ding nîng an tih, hrâttak le huoitakin um phawt el rawh,” tiin."
"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king), and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;","Chun, Jerusalem lal, Adoni- zedek chun Josuain Ai khuo a lâk a, a suksiet dêr a, Jeriko le an lal a suksiet angin, Ai khuo le an lal khawm a suksiet dêr a, Gibeona mihai chun Israelhai le chun inremna an siem a, anni lai an chêng ve tah ti a lo hriet chun, a ṭi ta hle el a."
"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.","Gibeon chu khaw lientak, lal khawpui ang a ni sih a, Ai khuo nêk chun a ropui lem a, mihriem po pohai khawm chu mi hrâttak an ni sih a."
"Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,","Chuongchun, Jerusalem khaw lal Adoni-zedek chun Hebron lal Hosham, Jarmuth lal Piram, Lakis lal Japhia le Eglon lal Debir hai chu,"
"Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.","“Hung unla, mi hung ṭhangpui ro khai, Gibeon hi va thawng ei tiu, Josua le Israel thlahai leh inremna an siem ta sih a,” tiin ân cha khâwm a."
"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.","Chuongchun, Amor mihai lalhai panga, Jerusalem lal, Hebron lal, Jarmuth lal, Lakis lal, le Eglon lal chu an pung khâwm a, an sipaihai po po leh an hang feh a, Gibeon epa chun an um a, an indopui tah a."
"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.","Chun, Gibeon mihai chun an riebûk Gilgalah, Josua kuomah mi an tir a, “I siehlawhai hi ngaitha naw raw khai; inhmawtakin kan kuomah hung vat la, mi hung sandam la, mi hung ṭhangpui rawh: tlâng rama chênghai Amor lalhai keini mi thaw dingin an inhâwrkhâwm a nih,” tiin."
"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.","Chuongchun, Josua le a kuoma râl kâp mi po po le, mi hrât huoisen- hai po po chu, Gilgala inthawk chun an hang feh a."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Anni chu ṭi dêr naw rawh, i kutah ka pêk vawng tah a nih; anni laia mi tukhawm i hmaah ngîr thei ding hrim hrim an um nawh,” a tih a."
Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night.,"Chuongchun, zânkhuoa Gilgala inthawka hang fein Josua chun thâwk lekhatin anni chu a thaw ta thut a."
"And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.","LALPAIN anni chu Israelhai hmaa chun a sukbuoi tah a, Gibeona chun tamtak a that a, Beth-horon hang fena lampuiah a hnawt a, Azeka le Makeda chenin a that pei a."
"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.","Chun, Israel mihai hmaa an tlânsie a, Beth-horona inthawka liem thlâkna hmuna an um lai chun LALPAIN vâna inthawkin riel lien- tak takin Azeka chenin a zuk indêng- tir pei a, an thi a, Israel thlahaiin kâwlhnâma an sât hlum nêk hmanin riel dêng hlum chu an tam lem a nih."
"Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Amor mihai chu Israel thlahai kuta a pêk ni chun Josua chun LALPA kuomah thu a hril a, Israel mihai mithmua chun, “Nisa, Gibeon chungah ngîr zing rawh. Nang khawm, thlapa, Aijalon ruoma hin um zing rawh”, a ta"
"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.","Chuongchun, chu hnam chun an hmêlmahai chunga phuba an lâk hmakhat chun nisa chu a ngîr ta zing a, thla khawm chu a um ta zing a. Hi thu hi Jaser buah ziek a ni naw am a nih? Chuongchun, nisa chu vân laizâwlah a um ta zing a, ni khat pumhlûm lai tlâk zai hrim hrim a rêl nawh."
"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.","LALPAIN chuong anga mi- hriem râwl a ngai ni ang chu a hmain ni hrim hrim a um ngai nawh a, a hnunga khawm a um ngai bawk nawh; LALPAIN Israelhai chu a dopui a ni sih a."
"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.","Chun, Josua le Israel mihai po po chu Gilgala an riebûka chun an kîr nâwk vawng tah a."
"And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.","Chuong lal pangahai chu an tlân hmang a, Makeda pûkah an inbih a."
"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.","Chun, “Lal pangahai chu hmu an ni tah, Makeda pûka inbi an nih,” ti Josua chu an hril a."
"And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:","Chuongchun, Josua chun, “Pûk kawtkhâra chun lung lientak tak inhlum unla, a vêngtuhai khawm inumtir ro."
"but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.","Nangni ruok chu um naw unla, in hmêlmahai chu hnawt pei unla, a hnung dâlhai kha that unla, an khuoa hrim hrim inlûttir naw ro, LALPA in Pathien chun anni chu in kutah a pêk ta sih a,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,","Chun, Josua le Israel thlahai chun an chimit hmakhata, an that an that zo a, a um sunhai khawm chu khawpui kulpui neia dâm an lût hnung chun,"
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.,"mi po po chu Josua kuom tieng Makedaa chun râl muongtakin an hung nâwk tah a, tukhawma Israel thlahai tienga hrim hrim an lei an sukchâng nawh."
"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.","Chuongchun, Josua chun, “Pûk kawtkhâr kha hang hawng unla, lal pangahai kha pûka inthawkin ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro,” a tih a."
"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.","Chuong ang chun an thawh a, chu lal panga Jerusalem lal, Hebron lal, Jarmuth lal, Lakis lal le Eglon lal hai chu pûka inthawk chun a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
"And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.","Chuong lalhai chu Josua kuoma an hung ṭhuoi chun, Josua chun Israel mihai po po chu a ko khâwm a, a kuoma fe ve râl kâp mihai laia lusa deu deuhai kuoma chun, “Hung hnai unla, hieng lalhai ringahai hin in kephahaiin sir ro,” a ta. Chun, an hung hnai a, an ringahai chun an kephahai chun an sir tah a."
"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.","Josua chun an kuomah, “Ṭi naw unla, zâm bawk naw ro, hrâttak le huoitakin um lem ro; in hmêlmahai po po in dohai chungah LALPA chun hieng ang hin a thaw pei ding a nih,” a ta."
"And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.","Chu zoa chun, Josua chun a thawh a, a sukhlum tâwl a, thing panga lêrah a khai a, chuongchun, zântieng chen chun thing lêra chun an inkhai a."
"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.","Nisa tlâka chun Josua chun thu a pêk a, thing lêra inthawk chun an lâk thlâk a, an inbîkna pûka khan an peilût a, pûk kawtkhâr chu lung lien- tak takin an sîn a, tu chen khawm hin a la um zing."
"And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.","Josua chun chu ni chun Makeda chu a lâk a, a lal khawm kâwlhnâmin a thawh a, chu khuoa um po pohai le chun a sukhlum fai rêt a, pakhat khawm hla hrim hrim a nei nawh. Jeriko lal chunga a thaw ang bawk khan Makeda lal chunga khawm a thawh a."
"And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Makeda khuoa inthawk chun Libna tieng an feh a, Libna chu an thawh a,"
"and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.","chuongchun, chu khuo chu an lal pumin Israelhai kutah a pêk nâwk bawk a; chun, chu khuo chu thawin a sûnga um po pohai chu kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum vawng a, a sûngah mi pakhat khawm hla hrim hrim an nei nawh; Jeriko khaw lal chunga an thaw ang bawk khan chu khaw lal chunga khawm chun an thawh a."
"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Libnaa inthawk chun Lakis tieng chun an feh a, ṭhanghmun an khuor a, an do tah a,"
"and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.","chuongchun, LALPAIN Lakis chu Israelhai kutah a pêk a, a ni hni niin an lâk a, chu khuo chu thawin a sûnga umhai po po kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum vawng a, Libna chunga an thaw ang bawk khan."
"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.","Chuongchun, Gezer lal Horam chu Lakis ṭhangpui dingin a hung a, chun, Josua chun ama le a rawihai leh pakhat khawm hlâ hlek loin a lo that rip a."
"And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Lakis a inthawk chun Eglon tieng chun an feh a, ṭhanghmun an khuor a, an do tah a."
"and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.","Chu ni ma chun an lâk a, chu ni ma chun chu khuo chu thawin a sûnga um po pohai kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum fai rêt a, Lakis chunga an thaw ang bawk khan."
"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Eglona inthawkin Hebron tieng an hang feh a, an do tah a,"
"and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.","chuongchun, an lâk tah a; chu khuo le a lal le a khawpui po po leh, a sûnga um po pohai chu kâwlhnâmin an thawh a, an sukhlum vawng a, Eglon chunga an thaw ang bawk khan pakhat khawm hlâ hrim hrim an nei nawh a; a suksiet letdêr a, a mi umhai po po an sukhlum fai rêt a."
"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:","Chun, Josua le Israelhai po po chu Debir tieng chun an lêt nâwk a, an do a;"
"and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.","chuongchun, chu khuo le a lal le a khawpuihai po po chu an lâk a, chun, kâwlhnâmin an thawh a, a sûnga mi um po pohai chu an sukhlum fai rêt a, pakhat khawm hlâ hrim hrim an nei nawh; Hebron chunga thaw ang khan Debir le a lal chunga khawm an thawh a, Libna khuo le a lal chunga an thaw ang bawk khan."
"So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.","Chuongchun, Josua chun a ram pumin, tlâng ram dâm, Sim ram dâm, phai ram dâm, ṭên pangpêr ram dâm chu sukse vawngin, an lal po pohai chu a sukhlum vawng a; pakhat bêk khawm hlâ hrim hrim a nei dêr nawh: LALPA Israelhai Pathien thupêk angin, ân thuok thei taphawt chu a sukchimit vawng ta lem a."
"And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.","Chun, Josua chun Kades- Barneaa inthawkin Gaza chenin, Gosen ram po po leh Gibeon chenin a lâkpêk vawng a,"

"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.","Chun, Josua le Israel mihai po po chu Gilgala an riebûkah an kir nâwk tah a."
"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,","Hazar lal Jabinin chu chu a lo hriet chun Madon lal Jobab hai, Simron lal hai, Aksaph lal hai,"
"and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,","hmartienga tlâng ram lalhai dâm, Kinneroth simtienga Araba lal hai, phai ram lal hai dâm, thlang- tieng panga Dor tlâng sâng lal hai,"

"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.","An sipai ruolhai leh mi tamtak, an tam tieng chu tuisuoriet kama phaiphin zât zet, sakawr le tawlailîr tamtak leh an inthawk tah a."
"And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.","Chuong lalhai po po chu an intuok khâwm a, Israelhai chu thaw tumin Merom tuiahai chun an riek khâwm a."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Anni leiin ṭi naw rawh, zîngah hieng tik phât hin anni chu sukhlum sa vawngin Israelhai chu ka hung pêk el ding a nih; an sakawr thahai chu sat pêk i ta, an tawlailîrhai chu i raw el ding a nih,” a ta."
"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.","Chuongchun, Josua le râlkâp mihai po po chu Merom tuiahai chun an vân thawk ta phut el a, an baw tah a."
"And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.","Chun, LALPAIN anni chu Israel- hai kutah a pêk a, an thawh a, Zidon Ropui chen dâm, Misrephoth-maim hmun chen dâm, saktieng panga Mizpe ruom chen dâmin an hnawt a; pakhat khawm hla hrim hrim nei loin an that vawng a."
"And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.","LALPAIN a tir angin, Josua chun an chunga chun a thawh a, an sakawr thahai chu a satpêk a, an tawlailîrhai chu a rawpêk bawk a."
"And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.","Chuong lai chun Josua chu a hnungkîr a, Hazor chu a lâk a, an lal chu kâwlhnâmin a that a, kha hma khan chu Hazor chu chuong lai vêl ram po poa khawpui tak a nih."
"And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.","Chu khuoa mi umhai po po chu kâwlhnâmin an that vawng a, an sukchimit dêr a, ân thuokthei taphawt chu pakhat khawm an hla nawh, chuongchun, Hazor chu meiin a raw tah a."
"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.","Chun, chuong lalhai khawpui- hai po po le an lalhai po po chu Josua chun a lâk vawng a, kâwlhnâma thawin a that a, a sukchimit vawng a; LALPA siehlaw Mosien thu a pêk ang khan."
"But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.","Amiruokchu, muolvûma khaw- pui lo umhai kha chu Hazor tilo chu Israelhai chun pakhat khawm an raw nawh a, chu khuo ruok chu Josuain a raw a nih."
"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.","Chuong khawpuia an râllâkhai po po le ranhai chu Israel thlahai chun anni chanpuolah an nei a, mihriem ruok chu an sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chu kâwlhnâmin an that a, ân thuokthei taphawt chu hla an nei nawh."
"As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN a siehlaw Mosie thu a pêk ang bawkin, Mosie khawmin Josua chu thu a pêk veh a, chuong ang tak chun Josua chun a thaw pei a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk po po chu thaw naw hrim a nei dêr nawh."
"So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;","Chuongchun, Josua chun chuong ram po po, tlâng ram dâm, sim ram po po dâm, Gosen ram po po dâm, phai ram dâm, Araba dâm, Israelhai tlâng ram dâm, an phai ramhai leh a lâk vawng a."

"For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang anga sukchimit vawng a, ditsakna nei dêr loa a sukbohmang theina dinga an lungril sukngarpêka Israel- hai indotir hlaktu chu LALPA chu a ni sih a."
"And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.","Chuong lai chun Josua chu a feh a, tlâng rama inthawk dâmin, Hebrona inthawk dâmin, Debira in- thawk dâmin, Anaba inthawk dâmin, Juda tlâng rama inthawk dâmin, Israel tlâng ram po poa inthawk dâmin, Anakim mihai chu a sukchi- mit vawng a, Josua chun an khawpuihai pumin a sukbohmang vawng a,"

"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.

Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.,"LALPA siehlaw Mosien Kades- barneaa inthawka ram va enthla dinga a mi tir lai khan kum sâwmli mi ka ni tah a; chun, ka lungrila um ang chie chu a kuoma khan kân tlun nâwk a."

"And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.","Ngai ta, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- a chuong thuhai chu a hrila inthawk Israelhai thlalêra an invâk an invâk sûng po po, kum sâwmli panga zet chu a lo hril ta angin LALPA chun a mîn damtir tah a; chuongchun, ngai ta, tuhin kum sâwmriet panga ka lo ni tah a."

"Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake.","Chuongchun, hi tlâng LALPAIN kha nia a lo hril ta kha mi pe el ta la, khânga Anakim mihai an um a, an khawpuihai khawm a ropuiin kula inhuon khup a nih ti kha nia khan i hriet kha, LALPA chun mi umpuiin, anni chu ka hnawt suok thei rawi mawh, LALPAIN a lo hril ta ang khan,” a ta."
And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.,"Chuongchun, Josua chun ama chu mal a sâwm a; Jephunne naupa Kaleb chu a rochan dingin Hebron chu a pêk tah a."
"Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuleiin, Hebron chu tu chen hin Keniz mi, Jephunne naupa Kaleb rochan a hung ni tah a nih, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu titakzeta a zui tlat leiin."

"And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;","Chuongchun, Jordan râla Gilead le Basan ram tiem loin Manasse chanpuolah hmun sâwm a tluh a;"
because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.,Manasse naunuhmeihai chun a naupasalhai laia chun chanpuol an nei ve lei a nih. Gilead ram chu Manasse naupasal danghai chun an chang a.
"And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.","Chun, Manasse ramri chu Sekem saktienga um Asera inthawka Mik- methath chenin a nih; ramri chu simtieng panga chun En-tappua mihai umna chenin a feh a."

"And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:","Chun, ramri chu Kana vadung- teah, vadungte simtieng panga chun a fe thlah a, chuong khawpuihai chu Manasse khawpuihai laia, Ephraim ta a nih.

"southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.","Simtieng pang chu Ephraim ta a na, hmârtieng pang chu Manasse ta a na, tuisuoriet chu a ramri a nih, hmârtienga chun Aser chenin a va nih a, saktienga chun Issakar chenin a hang nih."
"And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.","Issakar le Aser rama chun Manasse chun Beth-sean le a sîrvêl khuohai, Ibleam le a sîrvêl khuohai, Dora umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, En-dora umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, Taanaka umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, Megiddoa umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, zo khawsâng pathumhai chu a nei a."

"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.","Israel thlahai chu an hung hrât deu deu phing chun, Kanaan mihai chu sinthawa hmang dingin an inumtir a, an hnawt suok fai rêt ta nawh."
"And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?","Josef thlahai chun Josua kuom- ah, “Iengtiziea rohluo ding chanpuol pakhat le chan khat chau i mi pêk bîk am a na, LALPA hlakin mal a mi sâwm nasa a, kan tam hle sih a?” tiin an hril a."
"And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.","Josua chun an kuomah, “Chuonga tam in ni chun, Periz mihai le Ephraim mihai ram rampuihai khi, fe unla, in umna dingin hang vât ta unla, Ephraim tlâng ram in ta dinga a chîn taluo chun,” a tih a."
"And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.","Josef thlahai chun, “Tlâng ram hi kan ta dingin a hun naw a nih, phai rama Kanaan mi chênghai po po, Beth-sean le a khawpuia umhai le Jezreel ruoma umhai hin thîr taw- lailîr an nei seng sih a,” an tih a."
"And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:","Josua chun Josef sûnghai, Ephraim le Manasse thlahai kuoma chun, “In tam hleh a, hrât khawm in hrât a; chuongchun, chan khat chau chu nei da ti niu ie,"
"but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.","tlâng ram khi in ta ni el raw se, rampui khawm ni sienla, vât in ta, a ram chin po po chu in ta a ni el ding annâwm; Kanaan mihai chun thîr tawlailîrhai neiin, hrât hle hai sien khawm, in la hnawt suok ding annâwm,” tiin a hril a."

"And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.",Israel thlahai lai chun an chan- puol la pêk ve lo hnam sari an la um a.

So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:,"Chuongchun, an chanpuol ding anga ramri siem ang peiin ram chu an lo sem zo tah a; chuongchun, Israel thlahai chun Nun naupa Josua chu anni lai chanpuol an siempêk veh a;"

"These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.

"And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.","Chun, mihai chun Jordan vadung tieng chun kai chen chun an va hnawt tah a; chun, a hnawttuhai chu an suok phing le chun dai kawtkhâr chu an khâr tah a."
"And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;","An zâl hma chun in chunga chun an kuomah a hang feh a,"

"And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.","Chu chu kan lo hriet phingleh kan lungrilhai chu ântui zo a, nangni lei hin, mi tukhawm lungril mumal put hrim hrim hi an um nawh a, LALPA in Pathien chu chungtieng vâna le hnuoitieng hnuoiah Pathien a ni sih a."
"Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token;","Chuleiin, tuhin ka ngên cheu a nih, hi in chungah ka lunginsietzie cheu ka lo suklang tah a, nangni khawma ka pa sûnghai chungah in lunginsietna chu hung inlangtir ve ding le inchikna fietak mi siempêk dingin LALPA hming sâlin mîn khâmpêk ro:"

"And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.","Tukhawm i kawtkhâra in- thawka khawlaia suok taphawt chu ama lu chungah a thisen chu um a ta, keini chu thiemnaw changin um naw nîng ungah; chun, tukhawm in sûnga i kuoma um taphawt chu miin an chungah kut an thlâk chun kan lu chungah a thisen chu um a tih."

"And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.","Chun, amanu chun, “In thu ang pei chu ni raw se chu,” a tih a. Chuongchun, anni chu ân fetir tah a, an feh a; chun, tukvera chun pat sen chu a khitdeh a."

"Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.","Chuleiin, LALPA chu ṭi unla, titakzet le indiktakin a rawng bâwl unla, in thlatuhaiin Vadung râl le Aiguptaa a rawng an bâwl hlak pathienhai kha pei vawng unla, LALPA rawng chu bâwl ro."

"And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.","Josua chun an ser a tanna san chu hi hi a nih: Aiguptaa inthawka suokhai po po, pasal, râl kâp mi po pohai kha Aiguptaa inthawka an suok hnung khan lam kârlakah thlalêra khan an thi zo tah a nih."
"For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.","A hung suokhai po po kha chu ser tan sa vawng an na, amiruokchu, Aiguptaa inthawka an suok a, thlalêra lam kârlaka pienghai po po kha chu ser tan an ni ve nawh."
"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.","LALPA râwl an ngai nuom naw leiin mipui po po Aiguptaa inthawka hung suok, râl kap mihai chena, sukbohmanga an um vawng chenin Israel thlahai chu kum sâwmli zet thlalêra chun an invâk a, LALPAIN an thlatuhai kuoma nênetui le khuoi- zua luong ram inkhâma eini mi pêk a lo tiem kha, chu ram chu hmu lo dingin LALPAIN an kuomah ṭawng ân khâm a nih."
"And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.","Chuongchun, an thlahai anni aia ân ngîrhai chu Josua chun an ser a tanpêk a, lam kâra khan an ser tan a ni naw leiin, sertanlo an lo ni zing sih a,"
"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.","Chun, mipuihai po po ser an tan zo chun an dam hmakhat chu an riebûk mâni hmun sengah an um a."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Vawisûn hin Aigupta mihai hmusit- na cheu hi kân hlum hmang tah,” a ta. Chuongchun, chu hmun chu tu chen hin Gilgal an lo ti a nih."
And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.,"Israel thlahai chun Gilgala chun umhmun an khuor a; chun, Jeriko phaiahai chun chu thla ni sâwmpali ni, zântieng chun Fêkân Ruoiṭhe an hmang tah a."
"And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.",Fêkân Ruoiṭhe zo tûk ni ngei chun chu rama bu chawl ṭhanglo bei le bu zêupuok an fâk a.
"And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.","Chu rama bu an fâk zînga inthawk chun manna kha a tla ta nawh a; Israel thlahai chun manna chu an dawng ta ngai bawk nawh, chu kum chun Kanaan rama bu le bâl chu an fâk ta lem a nih."
"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?","Chun, Josua chu Jeriko khaw bula a la um lai chun a dâk a, a hang en a; a hma zâwn ela chun mi pakhat a kâwlhnâm phawisa chawia lo ngîr zing hi a hmuh a. Josua chun a hang pan a, a kuoma chun, “Keini tienga ṭhang am i ni, kan hmêlmahai tieng?” a ta."
"And he said, Nay; but as prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?","Ama chun, “Ni lo e, LALPA sipaihai hotu dinga hung ka ni lem,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Josua chu hnuoiah a bawkkhup a, chibai a bûk a, a kuom- ah, “Ka Lalpa chun a siehlaw kuoma hin ieng am hril ding a nei a?” a ta."
"And the prince of Jehovah’s host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.","Chun LALPA sipaihai hotu chun Josua kuomah, “I kephaa in- thawkin i kekawk kha hlîp rawh, i ngîrna hmun kha ân thieng a nih ie,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Josua chun chuong ang chun a thaw tah a."
"Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.","Jeriko khuo chu Israel thlahai lei chun an khâr tlat a, tukhawm an suok nawh a, tukhawm an lût bawk nawh."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “En ta, Jeriko le a lal le mi hrât huoisenhai hi i kutah ka pêk tah."
"And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.",Râl kâp mi po po hin khawpui hi vêlin vawikhat chu hang vêl suok phawt in ta; chuong ang ruok chun ni ruk in thaw ding a nih.
"And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.","Chun, thiempu pasariin bâwm hma tieng berâmchal ki tawtawrâwt pasari chawi an ta; chun, a ni sari ni chun khawpui chu vawi sari vêl suok in ta, chun, thiempuhai chun taw- tawrâwthai chu mût an tih."
"And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.","Chun, berâmchal ki an mût rik ruoi ruoi a, tawtawrâwt ri in hriet pha chun, mipui po po chu inring- takin khêk dur dur raw se; chuong- chun, khawpui kul chu chim rup a ta, mipui chu mâni hma zâwn sengah chun hang fêng an tih,” a ta."
"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, Nun naupa Josua chun thiempuhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Thuthlung bâwm hi zâwn unla, thiempu pasariin LALPA bâwm hmatienga chun berâmchal ki taw- tawrâwt pasari chawi raw se,” a ta."
"And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, ama chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Fe pei unla, khawpui chu vêl suok ro, chun, inrâlthuomhai kha LAL- PA bâwm hmatieng fe pei raw se,” a ta."
"And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.","Josuain mipuihai kuoma thu a hril zo chun LALPA hmaa berâmchal ki tawtawrâwt pasari chawi thiempu pasarihai chu an fe pei a, tawtawrâwt chu an mût a; chun, LALPA thu- thlung bâwm chun a zui a."
"And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.","Chun, inrâlthuomhai chu taw- tawrâwt mûttu thiempuhai hmaa chun an feh a, chun a hnungdâlhai chun bâwm chu an sawm a, thiem- puhai chun fe malamin tawtawrâwt chu an mût pei a."
"And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.","Chun, Josua chun mipuihai chu, “Khêk dêr naw unla, in râwl khawm hriet ni naw raw se, khêk dinga thu ka pêk ni cheu a tlung hmakhat chu in bâua inthawkin thu hrim hrim suok bawk naw sien, chu pha ruok chun chu khêk ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.","Chuongchun, LALPA bâwm chun khawpui chu vêl khat ân vêl suoktir a; chun, riebûka chun an feh a, riebûka chun an riek tah a."
"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, Josua chu zingkâr in- hmatakin a tho a, thiempuhai chun LALPA bâwm chu an zâwn a."
"And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.","Chun, LALPA bâwm hmaa be- râmchal ki tawtawrâwt pasari chawi thiempu pasarihai kha an fe pei a; tawtawrâwt an mût a; chun, inrâl- thuomhai chu an hmaah an feh a; chun, a hnungdâlhai chun LALPA bâwm chu an sawm a, thiempuhai chun, fe malamin tawtawrâwt an mût pei a."
"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.","Chun, a ni hni ni chun khawpui chu vawi khat an hang vêl suok nâwk a, riebûka chun an kîr nâwk a; chuong ang ruok chun ni ruk an thawh a."
"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.","A ni sari ni chun zîngkâr vâr- ṭienin an tho a, thaw dân pângngaiin vawi sari an vêl suok a, chu ni chau chun khawpui chu vawi sari an vêl suok a nih."
"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.","A vawi sarinaa thiempuhaiin tawtawrâwt an hang mût chun Josua chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Khêk ro khai, LALPAIN khawpui hi a pêk ta cheu a nih."
"And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.","Khawpui hi a sûnga thil um po po pumin suksiet dinga LALPA kuoma pumpêk vawng ding a nih; Rahab nawchizawr chau, ama le a in sûnga ama le um po pohai ruok chu ei mi tirhai kha a lo thuphmang leiin hla ding a nih."
"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.","Nangni ruokchu suksiet dinga thil pumpêka inthawk chun insie- kieng hlau ro, chuong naw chun, suksiet dinga thil pumpêk laia mi ieng khawm lo lain, Israelhai riebûk hi suksiet dingah siem in ta, lunginzîngna intlun hlau rawi in tih."
"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.","Tangkaruo dâm, rângkachak dâm, dâr le thîr bûrlebêlhai ruok chu a rêngin LALPA kuoma inthieng a na, LALPA sum inah an lût vawng ding a nih,” a ta."
"So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chu an khêk a, tawtawrâwthai mût an nih a.

"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.","Khawpui sûnga mi po po nuhmei pasal, a chîn a lien, bâwng- chal dâm, sabengtung dâm leh kâwl- hnâmin an sât hlum vawng tah a."
"And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.","Chun, Josua chun mi pahni ram va enthlatuhai kuoma chun, “Nâw- chizawr ina chun va lût unla, a kuoma ṭawng in lo inkhâm ta ang khan chu nuhmei chu a nei po po leh va ṭhuoi suok ro,” a ta."
"And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.","Chuongchun, enthlatu tlang- vâlhai chu an va lût a, Rahab le a pa le a nu leh, a unaupahai leh, a nei po pohai le chun an va ṭhuoi suok a, a laibung unauhai po po khawm an va ṭhuoi suok a, Israelhai riebûk puo- tienga chun an inumtir a."
"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, khawpui chu a sûnga thil um po po leh meiin an raw vawng a, tangkaruo dâm, rângkachak dâm, dâr le thîr bûr le bêlhai chau chu LALPA in sum inah an sieh a."
"But Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.","Amiruokchu, Rahab nawchi- zawr le a nei po po le a pa sûnghai chu Josua chun a hla vawng a; chuong- chun, Israelhai lai chun tu chen hin a la ṭhang ta zing a nih, Josuain Jeriko khuo enthla dinga a tirhai kha a lo thuphmang leiin."
"And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.","Chuong lai chun Josua chun, “Hi Jeriko khuo hi hung indina hung bâwl taphawt chu LALPA hmaa chun ṭawngsephurin um raw se, a nau lutîr chu chânin a lungphûm chu phûm a ta, a nau mitlum chânin a kul kawtkhârhai chu indin a tih,” tiin anni chu a vau a."
So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.,"Chuongchun, LALPA chu Josua kuoma chun a um a, a ram pumpuia chun a hming a hung inthang tah a."
"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.","Amiruokchu, Israel thlahai chun thil pumpêk chun thil an lo suksuol tah a. Juda hnama mi Zera naupa Zabdi, chu naupa Karmi, chu naupa Akan chun thil pumpêka mi chu a lo lâk a; chuongchun, Israel thlahai chunga chun LALPA lung a lo sen tah a."
"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.","Chun, Josua chun Jeriko khuoa inthawk chun Bethel saktieng, Beth-Aven dep Ai khuoa chun mihai a tir a, an kuomah, “Hang fe unla, ram hang enthla ta u,” tiin a hril a. Mihai chu an hang feh a, Ai khuo chu an hang enthlâk tah a."
"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.","Chun, Josua kuoma chun an kir nâwk a, a kuomah, “Mi po po chu hang fe kher da el raw hai se, mi sâng hni amanih, sâng thum amanih hang fe hai sienla, Ai khuo chu thaw raw se; mi po po hang suksâwl kher ding a ni nawh ie, tlâwmte chau an ni sih a,” an ta."
So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.,"Chuongchun, mipui laia mi chu mi sâng thum vêl chutaka chun an hang feh a; chun, Ai mihai hmaa chun an hung tlânse tah a."
"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent: and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.","Ai mihai chun mi sâwmthum le paruk lai an lo that a, dai kawtkhâr bula inthawk Sebarim chen rauin an hung hnawt a, an liem thlâknaa chun an that tâwl a, chun, mihai lungril chu ân tui zo tah a, tui ang el a lo ni tah a."
"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.","Josua chun a puonhai a keithlêr a, ama le Israel upahai chu LALPA bâwm hmaa chun an hmaia hnuoi sikin zântieng chenin an bawkkhup a; an luah pilvut an inphul a."
"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!","Josua chun, “E khai, iengdinga, Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, keini mipuihai hi sukbohmanga um dinga Amor mihai kuta pêk dinga Jordan vadung hi mi ṭhuoi kai am i na?

"Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!","Aw Lalpa, hienga hmêlmahai hnawta Israelhai an tlânse el hi ieng tin am ka thaw ding a ni ta leh?"
"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?","Kanaan mihai le hieng laia chênghai po po hin hrieng an ta, mi hung inhuol an ta, hnuoi chunga inthawk hin kan hming an sukbo dai ding a ni hi; i hming ropuitak ta ding hin ieng am i thaw ding a ni ta leh?” a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?","LALPA chun Josua kuomah, “Tho rawh, iengdinga khânga i bawkkhup zing am a na?"
"Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.","Israelhai hin thil an suksuol a nih; ka thuthlung pawm dinga ka pêk kha an bawsiet a ni hi; thil pumpêk laia ṭhenkhat an lâk bawk a nih; an inrûk a, an ip bawk a, an thuomhnaw lai ngei an thuphmang a nih."
"Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.","Chuleichun, a nih annâwm Israel thlahaiin an hmêlmahai an ngam thei naw; mawchang an lo ni ta leiin annâwm an hmêlmahai an hnung innghat el chu; thil pumpêk chu in laia in sukbo phawt naw chun in kuoma hin ka um ta naw ding a nih."
"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.","Tho la, mipuihai hi hlânthieng phawt el rawh; chun, an kuomah, ‘Zînga dingin inhlânthieng ro khai, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun, “Aw Israelhai, nangni lai hin thil pumpêk a um a nih, nangni laia thil pumpêk hi in lâk hmang hmakhat chun in hmêlmahai hi hne thei naw ti niu,” a ti a nih."
"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.","Chuongchun, zîngkâr a chi chia hung inlang ding in nih; LALPAIN chu mi chi a lo man chu a hnam hnamin in hung inlang nâwk ding a nih; chun, LALPAIN chu hnam a lo man chu a sûng sûngin in hung inlang nâwk ding a nih; chun, LALPAIN chu sûng a lo man chu a khât khâtin in hung inlang nâwk ding a nih."
"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.","Chun, tukhawm thil pumpêk lo la ta chu ama le a thil nei po po leh meia raw vawng ding a nih; LALPA thuthlung a bawsiet lei le, Israelhai lai thil suol invêtthlâktak a thaw leiin,’ ti rawh” a ta."
"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:","Chun, Josua chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, Israelhai chu a chi chiin a hung inlang tir a; Juda chihai chu man an lo ni tah a."
and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:,"Juda hnamhai chu a hung inlangtir nâwk a; Zer hnamhai chu a lo man a, Zerhai sûnghai chu a khât khâtin a hung inlangtir nâwk a; Zabdi chu man a lo ni tah a."
"and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.","Zabdi sûnghai chu a khât khâtin a hung inlangtir nâwk a; chuongchun, Juda chia mi Zera naupa, Zabdi, chu naupa Karmi,"
"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.","chu naupa Akan chu man a lo ni tah a. Josua chun Akan kuoma chun, “Ka naupa, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu ropuina pe rawh, a kuoma chun inphuong raw khai; i thilthaw chu mi hang hril ta, ka kuoma chu ip naw raw khai,” a ta."
"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:","Akan chun Josua chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chunga chun thil ka lo suksuol ta ngei el, hieng ang hin a nih ka lo thaw chu:"
"when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.","râllâk laia mi Babulon ram puon ṭhatak le, tangka shekel za hni le, rângkachak tlang shekel sâwmnga bûk ka hmuh a, kân hnar êm a, ka lâk el a nih; chun, ngai ta, ka puon in sûngah hnuoiah thuphmang a na, tangka chu chu hnuoia chun a um,” a tih a."
"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.","Chuongchun, Josua chun mihai a tir a, puon in sûnga chun an va tlân a; chun, puon ina chun thuphmang a lo ni a, hnuoia chun tangka khawm chu a um ngei ti an hmuh a."
"And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, puon in sûnga inthawk chun an lâk a, Josua le Israel thlahai po po kuoma chun an hung chawi a; LALPA hmaa chun an sie tah a."
"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.","Chun, Josua le Israelhai po po chun, Zera naupa Akan chu tangka dâm, puon dâm, rângkachak tlang dâm, a naupahai dâm, a naunuhai dâm, a bâwngchalhai dâm, a sabeng- tunghai dâm, a berâmhai le a puon in dâm le a neihai po po le chun an ṭhuoi a, Akor ruomah an hang fepui a."
"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.","Chun, Josua chun, “Iengdinga i mi suklungzîng am a na?

"And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.","A chunga chun lung an intieng vûm thûr a, tu chen hin a la um a; chun, LALPA lunginsenna nasatak chu a re tah a; chuongchun, chu hmun hminga chun tu chen hin Akor ruom an la ti zing a."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;","LALPA chun Josua kuomah, “Ṭi naw la, zâm bawk naw rawh, râlkâp mi po po i kuomah ṭhuoi la, tho la, Ai khuoah hang fe rawh; ngai ta, Ai khaw lal le, a mihai le, a khuo le a ram chu i kutah ka pêk tah."
"and thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.","Jeriko le an lal chunga i thaw ang khan Ai khuo le a lal chunga khawm thâwng i ta, râllâk le ranhai chau chu nangni chan dingin lâng in tih.

"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.","Chuongchun, Josua le râl kâp mi po po chu Ai khuo tienga hang fe ding chun an inthawk tah a; Josua chun mi hrât huoisen sîng thum a thlang suok a, zânah ân fetir a."
"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:","Anni chu thu a pêk a, “Ngai ta u, khawpui hnungtienga chun khawpui chu thaw dingin inchânru unla, khawpuia inthawka hlatakah fe naw unla, inzosa zingin um phawt el ro."
"and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;","Kei le keia kuoma umhai po po chun khawpui chu hung hnai kan ta; inhma ang bawka eini mi thaw dinga an hung suok phaleh, an hmaah tlânsieng kan ta."
"and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;","Chuongchun, mi hung hnawt dingin hung suok an ta, khuoa inthawka hla rei chen kan zâwr suok chenin; anni chun, ‘Inhma ang bawk khan ei hmaah an tlansie nâwk tah,’ an ti ding a nih. Chuongchun, an hmaah tlânsieng kan tih."
"and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.","Chun, inchânrûknaa inthawk chun hung suok in ta, khawpui chu la el in tih; LALPA in Pathienin in kutah a pêk ding a nih."
"And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.","Khawpui chu in lâk phingleh, khawpui chu raw el ro, LALPA thu ang peiin in thaw ding a nih; ngai ta u, thu ka pêk ta cheu hi,” tiin."
"And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.","Chun, Josua chun ân fetir tah a, inchânrûkna hmuna chun an feh a. Ai khuo thlangtienga Bethel le Ai khuo inkâra chun an um a, Josua ruok chu, chu zân chun mipuihai lai a riek a."
"And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.","Chun, Josua chu zîngkâr in- hmatakin a tho a, mipuihai chu a kei khâwm a; chun, ama le Israel upahai chu mipuihai hmaa chun Ai khuo tieng an hang feh a."
"And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.","A kuoma râl kâp mi umhai po po chu an hang feh a, khawpui bul chen chu an hang feh a, Ai khuo hmârtieng panga chun an riek a; Ai khuo le an inkâra chun ruom a um a."
"And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.","Chun, mi sâng nga lai a ṭhuoi a, khawpui thlangtieng pang Bethel le Ai khuo inkâra chun ân chânrûktir a."
"So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.","Chuongchun, mipui khawpui hmârtieng panga sipaihai ṭhang- hmun le, khawpui thlangtieng panga inchânrutuhai ṭhanghmun chu an hang ruot fel a; Josua chu chu zân chun ruom laitaka chun a riek a."
"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.","Chun, Ai khuo lal chun chu chu a hmu phingleh, inhmâwtakin chu tûk chun, chu khuoa mihai, ama le a rawihai po po chu an tho a, a hmun ruot Araba zâwnah Israelhai chu thaw dingin an hung suok tah a; nisienlakhawm, khuo hnungtieng chun ama thaw dingin an inchânrûk ti a hriet nawh a."
"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.","Josua le Israel mihai po po chu tlâwm ni âwmtakin an um a, thlalêr tienga lampuia chun an tlân tah a."
"And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.","Chun, khawpuia mi umhai po po chu anni hnawt dingin an ko khâwm a, chuongchun, Josua chu an hnawt a, khawpuia inthawk chun hla rei chu zâwr suokin an um tah a."
"And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.","Ai khuo le Bethel khuoa chun Israelhai hnawt lo chu pakhat bek khawm an um ta nawh a; khawpui chu khâr loin an mâksan el tah a, Israelhai chu an hnawt tah a."
"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuom- ah, “Fei i kuta um kha Ai khuo tieng nghain inlet rawh, i kutah ka pêk ding a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Josua chun a kuta fei chu khawpui tieng ngha chun a hang inlet tah a."
"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.","Chun, ân chânrutuhai kha an umna hmuna inthawk chun an hung suok vat a; a kut chu a hang phar phingleh an tlân a, khawpuia chun an lût a, an lâk tah a; khuo chu an raw tah a."
"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.","Chuongchun, Ai mihai chun an hnungtieng an hei thlîr chun, khaw- pui khu vântienga tung ngut ngut el chu an hmu tah a, khawtieng tienga khawm tlân theina hrim hrim an nei ta nawh a; chuongchun, thlalêra tlânhai khan anni hnawttuhai chu an hung lenghat ve ta thung a."
"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.","Chun, Josua le Israelhai po po chun inchânrutuhaiin khawpui an lâk, khawpui khu chu ân tung ngut ngut an hei hmu chun an hung kîr a, Ai mihai chu an that tah a."
"And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.","Chun, mi danghai chu a thaw dingin khaw sûnga inthawk chun an hung suok a; chuongchun, Israelhai chun ruongchaiche an thlâk tah a; a ṭhen khingtieng an um a, a ṭhen khingtieng an um bawk a; chuong- chun, an that a, pakhat khawm hla le insuo hrim hrim an nei nawh a."
"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.","Ai khuo lal ruok chu a hringin an man a, Josua kuomah an ṭhuoi a."
"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.","Israel mihai chun Ai khuoa mi phûla umhai po po chu thlalêr rama anni an va hnawtna hmunah an that zo a, an rênga kâwlhnâma an that rêm dêr hnung chun, Israel mihai po po chu Ai khuo tieng chun an kîr nâwk a, kâwlhnâmin an that tah a."
"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.","Chu nia thihai po po chu nuhmei le pasal mi sîng khat le sâng hni an nih, Ai khuoa mihai po po chu."
"For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.",Josua chun a fei inletna kut chu Ai mihai po po a sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chun a kei thlâk nawh a.
"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.","LALPAIN Josua thu a pêk a, thaw ding a ti ang ngei khan chu khawpuia ranhai le râllâkhai chau chu Israelhai chun anni chanpuolah an nei a."
"So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.","Chuongchun, Josua chun Ai khuo chu a rawh a, kumkhuoa dingin hnuoi pâwngah a siem a, tu chen hin râusan a lo ni tah a nih."
"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.","Chun, Ai khuo lal chu zântieng chenin thinglêrah a khai a; nisa tlâka chun Josuain thu a pêk a; chuong- chun, a ruong chu thinglêra inthawk chun an lâk thlâk a, khawpui dâi kawtkhâr lûtnaah an pei a, a chungah lung an dêng vûm thûr a, chu chu tu chen hin a la um."
"Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,","Josua chun Ebal tlângah LALPA, Israelhai Pathien ta dingin mâichâm a siem a;"
"as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.","Mosie dân lekhabua ziek ta anga, LALPA siehlaw Mosien Israel thlahai chu a lo pêk ta ang khan; chu mâichâm chu lung sut lo, tukhawma a chunga thîr an lân let ngailo a na; chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai an in- hlân a, inremna thilinhlânhaiin an inthâwi a."
"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.","Chun, chutaka chun Israel thlahai hma ngeia Mosien dân a ziek kha lungahai chun a zieksâwng a,"
"And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the home-born; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.","Chun, Israelhai po po, an upa- hai le hotuhai, an rorêltuhai leh, Levi chi thiempuhai, LALPA thuthlungna bâwm zâwntuhai hmaah, bâwm khingtieng khingtieng panga chun hnam danghai le, chu rama pienghai khawm chu an ngîr hmunkhat seng a.

"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.","Chun, chu hnunga chun dân thu po po, malsâwmna thu le ṭawngse- phurna thu chu a tiem a, dân lekha- bua chuong ang po po el kha."
"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.",Mosie thupêk ang po po chu Israel pungkhâwm po pohai le nu- hmeihai le naupang chite tehai le anni laia hnam dang chêng vehai hrieta chun Josua chun tiem ṭhel hrim hrim a nei nawh.

"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,","Nisienlakhawm, Gibeon khuoa umhai chun Josuain Jeriko khuo le Ai khuo a thaw dân an lo hriet chun,"
"they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,","var vervêkin an châng ve ta thung a, palai angin an insiem a, ip hluitak tak an sabengtunghai an inphurtir a, uoin peng hluitak tak, a ṭiek tahai leh,"

"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.","Chun, Josua kuomah Gilgala an riebûka chun an va feh a, a kuoma le Israelhai kuoma chun, “Ram hlataka inthawka hung kan na; chuongchun, kan kuoma hin thu thlung ro khai,” an va tih a."

"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,","Anni chun a kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien hming leiin i siehlawhai hi ram hlataka inthawka hung kan nih, a hming inthangzie dâm, Aiguptaa a thilthaw po po dâm,"

"And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.","Chun, kan upahai le kan rama chênghai po po chun kan kuomah, ‘Lampuia dingin fâk dinghai chawiin anni va be ro khai; chun, an kuomah, in siehlawhai kan ni hi, kan kuomah thu thlung ro khai ti unla,’ tiin an hril a."
"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:","Hieng kan fâk dinga kan beihai hi in kuoma hung dinga kan hung suok niin kan ina inthawka a luma kan hung chawi an na, nisienla- khawm, tuhin chu en hman ta u, a ṭâwl ṭuk tah a, a ap bur ta hi."

"And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.","Israel mihai chun an fâk ding hung chawi chu an lâk a, LALPA bâua thurâwn hrim an indawn nawh a."
"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.","Chuongchun, Josua chun anni le chun inremna a siem a, anni chu hlâ dingin an inkârah thuthlung a siem tah a, chun, a pungkhâwmhai laia mi lienhai khawm chun an kuomah ṭawng an inkhâm tah a."

"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.","Pungkhâwmhai mi lienhai chun LALPA Israelhai Pathien sâla ṭawng an lo inkhâm ta leiin, Israel thlahai chun anni an tâwk nawh a.

"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.","Anni chun Josua chu an dawn a, “LALPA i Pathien a siehlaw Mosie khan ram pumpui hi pe cheua in hmaa a ram hluotu um po pohai hi sukbohmang pei ding a nih ti thu a lo pêk kha i siehlawhai hi an lo hril chieng êm a; chuleiin, nangni leiin kan hringna hi chân kan inlau êm a, hieng ang hin kan lo thaw el a nih."
