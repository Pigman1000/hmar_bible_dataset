"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,","Paula, Isu Krista suok, tirko ni dinga ko, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha hril dinga ṭhethlâka um lekhathawn:"
"which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures,","Chu Chanchin Ṭha chu Pa- thienin inhmata a lekha inthieng- haia zâwlneihai baua a ilo tiem tah, a Naupa ei Lalpa Isu Krista thu chu a nih."
"concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,","Tisa tienga chun ama chu David suona insieng a na,"
"who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead; even Jesus Christ our Lord,",inthiengna Thlarau tieng thua ruok chun mithi laia inthawka a thonâwkna chun Pathien Nau a ni zie thilthawtheina nasatakin ân hriettir a;

"to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","Rom khuoa Pathien idittakhai, mi inthieng ni dinga kohai po po kuomah; Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Kristaa inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se."
"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.","A hmasatakin, khawvêl po poah in ringna thu ân thang leiin in rênga chunga ka lâwm thu, Isu Krista zârah ka Pathien kuomah ka hril a nih."
"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers",A Naupa Chanchin Ṭha hrila ka thlaraua a rawng ka ibâwl Pathien chu a mi hrepuitu a nih; ka ṭawngṭainahaia chun maloin in hminghai ka lam rawp a.
"making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto you.","Tu bêk hin in kuoma ka hung theina dingin Pathien remti ang anga, hung inzinna remchâng ka nei tei tei theina dingin ka hni rawp hlak."
"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;",In detna dinga Thlarau tieng thilpêk iengamanih ka pêk theina ding cheuin hmu cheu kân hâwk hle a nih.
"that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.",Chu chu in ringna le keia ringnain ei inthlamuon tuo theina dingin ka tina a nih.
"And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.","Unauhai, Jentail danghai laia kân rimna ra ka hmu ta ang bawkin, nangni lai khawm a ra ka hmu theina dingin, in kuoma hung vawi tamtak ka tum tah ti in hriet naw ka nuom nawh; nisienlakhawm, kha hma po khan chu dangin ka um rawp a."
"I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.","Grik mihai le hnamchawmhai kuomah bat ka nei, mi var le mi invêthai kuoma khawm."
"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome.","Chuongchun, nangni Rom khuoa mihai kuoma khawm Chan- chin Ṭha ka theitâwpa hril dingin inzosa zinga um ka nih."
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.","Chanchin Ṭha chu kân zâpui si nawh a, tûkhawm a awihai po ta dinga sandamna dinga Pathien thilthawtheina a ni sih a; a phutin Juda mi ta dingin, chun, Grik mihai ta ding khawmin a hung nih."
"For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.","Chutaka chun awi nâwkzuolna dingin, ringnain Pathien felzie chu a hung inlang a, “Ringna leia mifel chu hring a tih” tia ziek ang khan."
"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness;",Thutak fel nawtaka dangtuhai Pathien ngaisak nawna le fel nawna po po chunga chun vâna inthawkin Pathien lungsen a hung inlang a nih.
because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them.,"Pathienin ân hriettir ta leiin, Pathien chanchin hriet dinghai chu an lungrilah inhriettirin a um sih a."
"For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse:","Amaa mizie hmu thei lo hai, a chatuon thilthawtheina le a Pathien nizie chu, leihnuoi siem tîra inthawkin chiengtaka hmuin a um a, thilsiema chun ân lang a nih; chuleichun, suonlam ding hrim an nei nawh;"
"because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.","Pathien hre zing siin Pathien angin an chawimawi nawh a, lâwmthu khawm an hril bawk si nawh. Teplo mei mei an ngaituo lem tah a, an lungril invêt chu a hung inthim tah a."
"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,","Vara inngaiin invêt an lo ni tah a,"
"and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.","Pathien thi thei lo ropuina chu, mihriem thi thei dâm le vatehai dâm, sapheimanli le thilhringhai lim angah an inchangtir tah a."
"Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves:","Chuleichun, an taksa inzakum- taka insiem tuo dingin an lungril inhâwk anga pawrchêtaka um phalin Pathienin a nghatsan tah a."
"for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.","Pathien thutak chu khêla inchangtirin, a siemtu biek nêkin a isiemhai chu bein an rawng an bâwl ta lem sih a. A siemtu chu kumkhuoa inpâk tlâk a nih! Amen."
For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:,"Chuleichun, Pathienin inzak- umtaka hur phalin a nghatsan a; an nuhmeihai rau khawma an um dân insiengpui chu dân naw anga um dingin an insuk danglam sih a;"
"and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.","pasalhai khawm nuhmei le inhmang dân pângngai chu bânsana hurin, ân hnarin an inhnar tuoh a; pasal le pasal khawm ṭha nawtakin an inthawh a, an suol man hmu ding chu anni le annia chun an hmuh a."
"And even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;","Chun, Pathien hriet an nuom naw leiin, thil mawi naw tak tak thaw dinga a dit naw zâwng lungril nei phalin Pathienin a nghatsan tah a;"
"being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,","chuongchun, rîtlona tinrêng dâm, suolna tinrêng dâm, inhnarna tinrêng dâm, lungril ṭhat nawna tinrêng dâmin an hung sip tah a; îtsîkna dâm, tuolthatna dâm, inhalna dâm, inhlêmna dâm, lungril setak dâma sip an na; inberu hmanghai,"
"backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,","mi rêl hmanghai, Pathien theida zâwnghai, intiveihai, chapo- hai, mi uonghai, thil suol thar suksuoktuhai, nu le pa thu awi lohai,"
"without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:","hrietthiemna bo, thu tiem bawsietuhai, piengpui lunginsietna nei naw mihai, lunginsietna nei naw mihai an lo ni tah a;"
"who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.","chuong ang thawtuhai chu thi tlâk an nih, ti Pathien iruot chu hre zing siin, anni chau khawma thaw loin, mi dang a thawhai chunga khawm chun an lâwm bawk a."
"Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.","Unauhai, ka lung nuom zâwng le, anni ta dinga Pathien kuoma ka ṭawngṭaina san tak hi, sandam an hung ni theina ding a nih."
"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.","Pathien tieng ṭhahnem an ngai ti ka hrietpui a nih, hrietna indiktak leia ṭhahnemngaina ruok chu a ni nawh."
"For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.","Pathien felna hre loin, anni felna sukdet an tum a, Pathien felnaah an inpêk lût si nawh."
For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.,Krista chu ama ringhai po ta dingin felna an hmu theina dinga Dân suktâwpna a ni sih a.
For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.,"Mosie chun, “Mi Dâna felna zâwm chu, chu felna zâra chun hring a tih,” tiin a ziek a."
"But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)","Ringnaa felna ruok chun, hieng hin a hril, “In lungrilin, ‘Tu am vânah lâwn a ta?’ (chu chu Krista hung ṭhuoi thla ding tina a nih)"
"or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)","amanih, ‘Tu am vânsamah zu ṭum a ta?’ (chu chu mithi laia inthawka Krista zu ṭhuoi suok ding tina a nih) ti naw ro,” tiin."
"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:","Anleh, ieng am a hril a? “Thu chun a hnai che, i bau le i lungrila khawm a um,” tiin a hril a nih. Chu chu ringna thu ei hril hlak hi a nih:"
"because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:","I bauin, “Isu chu Lalpa a nih” tia i ṭan a, mithi laia inthawkin Pathienin a keitho ti i lungrila i ring phawt chun sandamin um i tih."
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.,"Mihaiin an lungrilin an ring a, felna an hmu hlak, bauin an ṭan a, sandamna an hmu bawk hlak a nih."
"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.","Pathien Lekha Thuin, “Tû- khawm ama ring taphawt chu muolpho naw ni hai,” a ti a nih."
"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:",Juda le Grik mihai chu ienga khawm an danglam chuong si nawh a. Lalpa pakhat an rênga chunga Lalpa a nih; ama lamtuhai po chunga chun ṭhatna a hau sih a.
"for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.","“Tukhawm Lalpa hming lam taphawt chu sandamin um an tih,” a ti a nih."
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?,"Anleh, an awi naw chu iengtin am lam an ta? A thu an hriet naw chu iengtin am awi an ta? Thuhriltu um loin iengtin am hrieng an ta?"
"and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!",Tir an ni naw chun iengtin am thu hril an ta? “Thil ṭha chanchin lâwmum intluntuhai ke chu a va mawi de!” tia ziek ang khan.
"But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?","Nisienlakhawm, Chanchin Ṭha chu an rêng chun an ring vawng nawh. Isaiin, “Lalpa, kan thu hril tuin am a ring a?” a ti sih a."
"So belief cometh of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.","Chuongchun, ringna chu hrietna leiin a hung um hlaka; chun, hrietna chu Isu Krista leiin a hung um."
"But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world.","Anleh, an nain an hriet naw am a nih? Hreh e le! “An ri chu ram tinah ân thang a, An thu chu kâwlkawdawng chenin ân thang suok tah.”"
"But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.","Anleh, Israel mihaiin an hriet naw am a nih? “Chia hril khawp lohai chu hmangin, Inthîktir ka ti cheu a, Hnam invêthai chu hmangin, Suklungsen ka ti cheu,” tiin Mosiein a hril hmasatak a."
"And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.","Chun, Isaiin huoitakin, “A mi zawng nawhai hmuin ka um a, A mi lam nawhai kuomah inhriettirin ka um a,” a tih a."
"But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.","Amiruokchu, Israelhai thua chun, “Mi timawhai le sêlhrâthai ta dingin, Sûnnithlâkin ka bânhai ka phar hlak kha,” a tih a."
"I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.","Anleh, Pathienin a mihai chu a pei thlâk am a nih? Teu lo e a! Kei khawm Israel mi, Abraham thla, Benjamin hnam ka ni sih a."
God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:,"Pathienin mi a ihriet lâwkhai chu a pei thlâk nawh. Pathien Lekha Thu chun Elija, thu a hril hi in hriet naw am a nih? Ama chun Israelhai chungthu Pathien kuomah ân tlun a;"
"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.","“Lalpa, i zâwlneihai an sukhlum a, I mâichâmhai an cho chim a, Keia khât chauin ka la um a, Kei khawm mi sukhlum an tum a nih,” a ti hi."
"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ieng- tin am a dawn a? “Baal hmaa la dingṭhaṭhuon ngai naw, mi sâng sari keia tâ dingin ka la hla zing a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.,"Chuong ang bawkin, tulai khawm hin lunginsietnaa thlang ang peiin pei thlâk mahla chu an la um."
"But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.",Lunginsietna lei a ni chun thilthaw lei ni ta naw ni; chuong a ni naw chun lunginsietna hi lungin- sietna ni ta naw ni.
"What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:","Iengtin am ni tâng a ti leh? Israel mihai chun an zawng chu an hmu nawh a; Thlanghai ruok chun an hmuh a, a danghai po po chu an ngawng zo tah a."
"according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.","“Pathienin vawisûn chen hin inlusukna thlarau a pêk a, hmu thei nawna mithai le, hriet thei nawna nâhai dâm le chun,” tia ziek ang khan."
"And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:","Chun, David chun, “An dâwkân chu an ta dingin châng le bil le, Tlûkna le, thungna lo ni raw se;"
"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.","An hmu thei nawna dingin an mithai hung inthim raw se; Nangin an ruongzâng inkûntir rawp rawh,” a tih a."
"I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.","Anleh, an tlûk chu an tlûk sawngna ding am a nih? Teu lo e a! An tlûk leiin Jentailhai kuoma chun sandamna a hung tlung ta lem a nih; Israel mihai inthîktirna dingin."
"Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?","Chuongchun, an tlûkna hman khawvêl sukhausakna a na, an kiemna hman Jentailhai sukhausak- na a ni chun, an famkimna chu an hausakna a va ni nasa zuol ding de!"
"But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;","Chuongchun, nangni Jentailhai kuomah ka hril a nih. Kei Jentailhai tirko ka ni leiin, ka rawngbâwlna sin hi ka chawimawi a nih;"
"if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them.","ka chipuihai kân thîktir hrâm theina ding le, anni laia mi ṭhenkhat ka sandam theina dingin."
"For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?","Anni pei thlâkna hman khawvêl ta dinga inrem nâwkna a ni chun, anni lâwm nâwkna ding chu, thinaa inthawka hring nâwkna naw chu ieng am ning a ta?"
"And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.","Chun, bei tlang ât thlâk hmasa- tak chu inhlân thieng a ni chun a pumin chuong ang bawk chu a nih. A zung ân thieng chun a kâuhai khawm chuong ang bawk chu a nih."
"But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;","Chun, a kâu a ṭhen chu suk- tlieka umin, nang oliv puopa ni si, anni laia zawma umin, oliv thing hringna ṭha în ṭawmpui ve a ni chun,"
"glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.","a kâu danghai lai chun insuong naw rawh. Insuong la khawm, nang a zung châwmtu i ni nawh a, a zung chu nang a châwmtu che a ni lem a nih."
"Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.","Chun, nangin, “Zawma ka um theina dingin a kâuhai chu suktliekin a um annâwm?” tîng i tih."
"Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:","Anih, an ring nawna leiin suk- tliekin an um a, nang i ringna leiin i ngîr a nih."
"for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.","Chapo naw la, ṭi lem rawh. Pathienin a kâu takhai hman a hla si naw chun nang khawm hla bîk naw ni che."
"Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.","Chuongchun, Pathien ṭhatzie le a ṭiumzie chu ngaituo rawh; a tluhai ta ding chun ṭi a um a nih; nanga ta ding ruok chun a ṭha a nih, a ṭhatnaa i um zing chun; chuong a ni naw chun, nang khawm sât thlâkin um vêng i tih."
"And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.","Chun, anni khawm chu awi loa an um zing naw chun zawmin um an tih; Pathienin anni a zawm nâwk thei sih a."
"For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?","Nang oliv puopa hrima in- thawka sât thlâk hman, pieng dân naw anga oliv thing ṭhaa zawma i um chun, chuong a kâu tak takhai chu an bulpui, oliv thing pângngaia chun zawm an va ni nasa âwm de!"
"For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;","Unauhai, hi thurûk hi in hriet naw ka nuom nghâl si nawh a, chuong naw chun intivar in tih; Jentail famkimna a hung tlung hma chun Israel mi ṭhenkhat chungah ngawngna a hung tlung hri phawt a nih, ti hi."
"and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:","Chuongchun, Israel mi po po sandamin um an tih; “Ziona inthawkin Sandamtu chu hung suok a ta, Jakob kuoma Pathien ngaisak nawna sukbo a tih."
"And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.","Chu chu an kuoma ka thu thlung ding chu a nih, An suolhai ka lâk hmang pha chun,” tia ziek ang khan."
"As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.","Chanchin Ṭha tieng ngaituo chun nangni leiin hmêlma an nih; Thlang thu tienga ngaituo ruok chun, thlatuhai lei khan dittakhai an nih."
For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.,Pathienin a thilthlâwnpêkhaia le a konaa chun a lungril a lêt ngai si nawh a.
"For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,","Inhma khan Pathien thu in awi nawh a, nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu an awi naw leiin lunginsietna in chang sih a;"
"even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.","Chuong ang bawkin tuhin chu Pathienin a lunginsiet cheu lei hin, lunginsietna chu an hmu ve theina dingin anni khawm chun an awi ve ta naw a ni hi."
"For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.",Pathienin a lunginsiet vawng theina dingin mi po po awi lonaah a khum ta vawng sih a.
"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!","Pathien hausakzie, a varna le hrietna hauzie chu a vân thûk de! A rorêlnahai chu hriet thei ruol le, a lampuihai chu sui thei ruol a va ni naw de!"
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?,Lalpa lungril chu tuin am a hriet a? A remruotpêktua khawm tu am a ṭhang tah a?
"or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?",A thung nâwk dingin tuin am a kuomah thil pe hmasa?
"For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. Amen.","Amaa inthawk le ama zâr le, ama ta dinga thil po po a hung um a ni sih a; ama kuoma chun chatuonin ropuina chu um raw se. Amen."
"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.","Chuongchun, unauhai, Pa- thien lunginsietna lei hin in- thâwina hring le inthieng le Pathien ilâwmtlâk ni dingin, in taksa chu inhlân dingin ka ngên cheu a nih; chu chu in rawngbâwlna âwm hrim a nih."
"And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.","Hi khawvêl dân ang hin um naw unla, Pathien dit zâwng a ṭha le lâwmtlâk le ṭha famkim chu in hriet chieng theina dingin, in lungril a thara umin, hung danglam lem ta ro khai."
"For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.","Pathienin a mi pêk lunginsietna lei hin in laia tukhawmin in ingaihlu tâwk bâka inngaihlu loin, Pathienin mi tin kuoma ringna huntâwk a pêk ang peiin, feltaka ngaituo lem dingin ka ti seng cheu a nih."
"For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:","Taksa pumkhatah pêng tamtak ei nei a, a pêng po po sinthaw chu an âng vawng nawh a;"
"so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.","chuong ang bawkin, eini tamtak ni inla khawm Kristaa chun taksa pumkhat ei na, amal malin inpêng tuo seng ei nih."
"And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;","Lunginsietna ei kuoma pêk ang sengin thilthlâwnpêk hi a tum tum ei nei seng a, thu hril ding a ni chun, ei ringna phutâwk peiin hril ei tiu;"
"or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;","rawngbâwl ding a ni chun ei rawngbâwlnaa chun inpe tlat ei tiu, inchûktirtu khawmin inchûktir tlat raw se;"
"or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.","mi infuitu khawma infui raw se; thil petu khawmin inro loin pe raw se, rorêltu chun taimatakin ro rêl raw se; mi lunginsiettu khawmin lâwmtakin lunginsiet raw se."
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.,"Hmangaina chu vervêkna ṭhang loin ni raw se. Suol tieng chu theida unla, ṭha tieng chu pawm tlat ro."
In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;,Unauhai hmangai kawnga chun inhmangai takin inlainat tuo seng ro; chawimawi kawnga chun inditsak tuo seng ro;
in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;,"taimâk kawnga chun thaboin um naw ro; thlarau kawnga chun ṭhahnem ngai unla, Lalpa rawng bâwl unla,"
rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;,"beiseina kawnga chun, lâwm unla; rinum tuor kawnga chun tuor- sel unla, ṭawngṭaina kawnga chun ṭawngṭai fan fan ro."
communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.,"Mi inthienghai tlâksamnaa chun sawmdâwl unla, mikhuolhai lâwm hlak mi ni ro."
"Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.","A suknawmnatuhai cheu chu malsâwmpêk unla, ṭawngsie chu in phur naw ro."
Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.,"Lâwmhai chu lâwmpui unla, ṭaphai chu ṭappui ro."
"Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.","Ngaituo hmunkhatin um tuo seng unla, inngaituo sâng taluo naw unla, mi chînhai inruolpui lem ro. Intivar naw ro."
Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.,"Tu suol khawm suolin thung naw ro, mi po po ngaia thil mawi chu ngaituo lâwk ro."
"If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.",A thei phawt chun nangni tieng bêk mi po po le inremin um ro.
"Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath of God: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.","Dittakhai, in phuba la naw unla, Pathien lunginsenna inkien lem ro, “phuba hrim hrim keia lâk ding a nih, keiin thung ka tih, Lalpain a tih,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
"But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.","Chuleiin, i hmêlma a phîng a ṭâm chun fâk ding pe la, a dang a châr chun dâwn ding pe rawh; chuong anga i thaw chun a lu chunga meiling i sie khâwl nîng a tih."
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.","Suol ihnein um naw la, ṭhatnain suol chu hne lem rawh."
Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God.,Mi tin an chunga rorêltuhai thu thuin um raw se. Pathien thu loin tukhawm rorêltu an um ngai si nawh a; rorêltua umhai hi Pathien iruot an nih.
"Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.","Chuleiin, tûkhawm rorêltu kal chu Pathien iruot kal a nih; a kaltuhai chun anni chungah rorêlna hmûng an tih."
"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:","Rorêltuhai chu thil ṭha thaw- tuhai ta ding chun ṭium an ni nawh a, thil ṭha naw thawtuhai ta ding ruok chun ṭium an nih. Anleh, rorêltu ṭi loa um i nuom am? Thil ṭha thâw la, a înpâk hlâwng i tih;"
"for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.","ama chu i ṭhatna dinga Pathien rawngbâwltu a ni sih a. Nisien- lakhawm, thil suol i thaw chun ṭi rawh, kâwlhnâm chu a chawi mei mei si nawh a; ama chu Pathien rawng- bâwltu, thil suksuoltuhai chunga lunginsenna phuba latu a ni sih a."
"Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.","Chuleiin, lunginsenna ṭi lei chau ni loin, i sie le ṭha hrietna lei khawmin rorêltu thu thuin i um ding a ni hrim a nih."
"For for this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.",Hi lei hin annâwm sie khawm in chawi hlak; chuong ang thil ngei thaw fan fan dinga Pathien rawng- bâwltuhai an ni sih a.
Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.,"Mi po po kuomah pêk ding taphawt chu pe ro; leiman pêkna ding kuoma chun leiman pe unla, sie chawina ding kuoma chun sie chawi unla, ṭi ding chu ṭi unla, inza ding chu inza ro."
"Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.",Inhmangai tuona ngawt naw chu tû iengkhawm bat naw ro; mâni mihriempui hmangaitu chun dân chu a zâwm famkim ta sih a.
"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.","Hieng, “Uire naw, tuol that naw, inru naw, inhnar naw,” ti le thupêk danghai hrim hrim hi, “Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai i hmangai ding a nih,” ti hin a khai khâwm vawng a nih."
Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.,"Hmangainain vênghai a suk- khawhlo ngai nawh a, chuleiin hmangaina hi dân hraw famkimna a nih."
"And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed.","Tulai thil umzie in hriet lei le, inhai ta dingin innaa inthawkin ṭhanghar a hun ta takzet ti in hriet leiin chu chu ka hril a nih; tuhin chu ei awi phut lai nêk khan chu ei sandamna chu a hnai lem ta sih a."
"The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.","Zân hi a bo vâng vâng tah a, khuo a var ding a ni tah, chuleiin inthimna thilthawhai chu pei inla, var thuomin inthuom ei tiu khai."
"Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.","Sûna um angin mawitakin um ei tiu, zu dâwn buoi le zu inruia um loin, hur le indit hmanga um loin, insuol le inîtthîka um loin,"
"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.","Lalpa Isu Krista chun inthuom lem unla, in tisa inhâwkna puitlin dingin iengkhawm insiem naw ro."
"But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not for decision of scruples.","Chun, ringnaa hrât naw mi chu, a ringhlana sawisêl loin, lâwm lem ro."
One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.,"Mi pakhatin iengkim fa theiin ân ring a, mi hrât naw ruok chun thlai chau a fâk hlak."
Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.,Iengkim fa mi chun a fa naw chu hmusit naw raw se; a fa naw khawm chun a fatu chu sawisêl naw raw se; Pathienin ama chu a lâwm tah annâwm.
"Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.","Mi dang siehlaw sawisêltu chu tu am i ni leh? a ngîr le a tlûk chu ama hotupa ta ding a nih. Nisienlakhawm, ama chu inngirtirin um a tih, Lalpa chun ân ngîrtir thei sih a."
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.,"Mi pakhatin ni khat hi ni dang nêkin a ngaihlu bîk hlak a, mi dangin ni po po chu inang sengin a ngai hlak a nih. Mi tin mani lungrilah inhre chieng raw se."
"He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.","Ni insertu chun, Lalpa chawi- mawina dingin ân ser hlak a na. Iengkim fatu chun, Pathien kuomah lâwm thu a hril a, Lalpa chawi- mawina dingin a fâk hlak a nih; a fa nawtu khawm chun, Pathien kuomah lâwm thu a hril a, Pathien chawimawina dingin a fâk naw hlak a nih."
"For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.","Tûkhawm mâni ta dinga hring ei ni nawh a, tûkhawm mâni ta dinga thi ei ni bawk nawh."
"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.","Ei hring chun Lalpa ta dingin ei hring a, ei thi khawmin Lalpa ta dingin ei thi a ni sih a; chuleiin, ei hring khawmin ei thi khawmin Lalpa ta ei nih."
"For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.",Krista thina le a hung hring nâwkna san chu mi dam le mi thi Lalpa a ni theina hi a ni sih a.
"But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.","Nisienlakhawm, nangin ieng dinga i unau i sawisêl am a na? annawleh, nangin ieng dinga i unau i hmusit am a na? Pathien rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaah ei rêngin ei la ngîr ding a ni sih a."
"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.","“Lalpa chun, ‘Mi tinrêng Ka hmaah kûn an ta, Lei tinrêng khawm Pathien kuomah inphuong an tih,’ Tiin ṭawng kân khâm a nih,” a tih a, ti ziek ang khan."
So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.,"Chuongchun, ei rêngin Pathien kuomah mâni chanchin ei hril seng ding a nih."
"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.","Chuleiin, insawisêl tâwl ta nâwm ei niu khai; tûkhawmin mâni unau kalna amanih tlûkna amanih siem naw tum lem seng ro."
"I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.","Ama le ama ngawt chun ân thieng naw iengkhawm a um nawh ti Lalpa Isua chun ka hriet hle a nih, thil inthieng loa ngaitu ta ding chun, ama ta ding chun ân thieng naw a nih."
"For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.","I thil fâk leia i unau lungril a na chun, hmangai dân kawng chu i hraw ta nâw a nih. A thi ai Kristain a thipêk chu i thil fâkin sukbo naw rawh."
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:,"Chuongchun, in ta dinga ṭhatna chu suola hrilin um naw raw se;"
"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.","Pathien ram chu dâwn le fâk tieng thu a ni si nawh a; felna dâm, inremna dâm, Thlarau Inthienga lâwmna dâm a ni lem ie."
"For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.","Tûkhawm, chuong thua Krista rawng bâwl chu, Pathien lâwm zâwng le mihriem inpâkin a um hlak."
"So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.","Chuongchun, inremna le insuk- sâwt tuona ding thilhai chu hnawt ei tiu."
Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.,"I thil fâk leiin Pathien sinthaw sukse naw. Thil po po chu ân thieng ngei, nisienlakhawm, a thil fâkin mi a sukthlûk chun, a fatu ta dingin suol a nih."
"It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth.","I unau tlûkna ding a ni chun, sa fâk lo dâm, uoin dâwn lo dâm, thil iengkhawm thaw lo a ṭha lem a nih."
"The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.",Ringna i nei chu Pathien hmaah nang chau ihrietin nei el rawh. Mâni ṭha ti kawnga thiemnaw inchangtir naw chu a ham ṭha.
"But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.","Amiruokchu, ringhlatuin a fâk chun, ringnain a fâk naw leiin thiemnaw a chang a nih; iengkhawm ringna boa thaw chu suol a ni sih a."
"Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.","Chuongchun, eini mi hrâthai hin mâni lâwmna zawng loin mi hrât nawhai hrât nawna ei tuorpui lem ding a nih."
"Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.","Mâni vênghai suksâwtna dingin an ṭhatna dingin suklâwm tum seng ei tiu,"
"For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.","Krista khawm chun mâni lâwm- na a zawng si nawh a. “Nangma haltuhai halna che chu keia chungah a tla tah,” ti ziek ang khan a um lem."
"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.","Pathien Lekha thua tuorselna le lungmuongna hmua beiseina ei nei theina dingin, inhmaa ziekhai ta- phawt chu eini inchûktirna dinga ziek an ni sih a."
Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:,Tuorselna le thlamuongna Pa- thien chun Isu Krista hril angin lungril hmunkhat put dingin inumtir raw se cheu;
that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.,"ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa chu, lungril hmunkhat le inthuruola in chawimawi theina dingin."
"Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.","Chuleiin, Krista chun Pathien sukropuina dinga a lâwm cheu ang bawk khan, inlâwm tuo seng ro."
"For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers,",Hi hi ka ihril chu a nih: thlatuhai kuoma thutiemhai chu sukdet ding le Pathien thu ân dik ti inhriettirna dingin Krista chu sertanhai rawng- bâwltuin a hung um a;
"and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.","lunginsietna leia Jentailhaiin Pathien an chawimawi theina dingin; “Chuleiin, Jentailhai lai chun, Inpâk ka ti cheh a, I hming chawimawina dingin Hla sak ka tih,” tia ziek ang khan,"
"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.","Chun, “Nangni Jentail po pohai, A mihai leh lâwm ro,” a ti nâwk a."
"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.","Chun, “Nangni Jentail po pohai, Lalpa chu inpâk ro; Mi po po khawmin, Ama chu inpâk raw se,” a ti nâwk a."
"And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.","Chun, Isaiin, “Jessai zung zâm chu um a ta, Jentailhai Lala um dingin, A hung suok ding chu um bawk a ta, Ama chu Jentailhai chun beisei phâng an tih,” a ti nâwk bawk a."

"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.","Chun, ka unauhai, nangni chungthu chu, nangni ngei ṭhatnain in sip a, varna tinrêng in haua, in inkâwk tuo thei ti kei ngei khawmin indiktakin ka hriet."
"But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,","Nisienlakhawm, inhriettir nawn ding cheuin khâwlai lai hin amanih huoitakin ka ziek a nih: Pathienin a mi pêk lunginsietna lei hin Jentailhai laia Krista Isu rawng- bâwltu ka nih."
"that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.","Jentailhai inhlânna chu, Thla- rau Inthieng sukthienga lâwmtlâk an ni theina dingin Pathien Chanchin Ṭha kawngah thiempu sin ka thaw a nih."
I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.,"Chuongchun, Pathien tieng kawnga chu, Krista Isua chun suong ding ka nei a nih."
"For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,",Jentailhai inâwitir dingin Kristain thilthaw le thu hrilin keima mi hmanga a thilthawhai chau naw chu iengkhawm hril ngam si naw ning a;

Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:,"Chu lei tak khawm chun a nih, in kuoma hung ka ṭhul rawp hlak chu."
"but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,","Tu ruok hin chu hieng ram vêla hin sinthawna hmun hrim ka nei ta nawh, kum tamtak chu in kuoma hung inhâwkin ka um ta bawk a,"
"whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—","Spain rama ka fe phaleh ka fe malama hmu cheu ka beisei sih a, nangni pâwl khawp deu zet lang cheu, chu tienga ka zu fenaa khawm chun nangni rawiin in mi zûn thla ka beisei bawk a nih."
"but now, I say, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.",Tu ruok hin chu mi inthienghai rawngbâwl dingin Jerusalemah ka fe phawt ding a nih.
For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.,"Makedonia le Akaia rama mihai chun lungâwitakin, Jeru- salema mi inthienghai laia mi rim- sihai ta dingin sum an thawlâwm ta sih a."
"Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.","Anih, lungnitaka an thaw a nih, an kuomah an bat hrim bawk a; Jentailhaiin an thlarau tieng thilah an in ṭâwmpui si chun, khawvêl tieng thilin anni sawmdâwl ve thung a ṭûl hrim a nih."
"When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.","Chuleiin, chu chu thaw zoa, a ra khawm feltaka anni kân hmutir zoin nangni sir malamin Spain ramah fe pei ka tih."
"And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.","Chun, in kuoma ka hung pha chun, Krista Chanchin Ṭha mal- sâwmna famkim phurin hung ka tih ti ka hriet a nih."
"Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;","Unauhai, tuhin, in mi ṭawngṭai pêknaa chun ṭhahnemngaitaka mi ṭawngṭai pêk dingin Lalpa Isu Krista le Thlarau Inthieng hmangainain ka ngên cheu a nih:"
"that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judæa, and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;","Judai rama awinawhai laia ka him theina ding le Jerusalem ta dinga sawmdâwlna ka ichawi hi, mi inthienghai lâwm zâwngtak a hung ni theina dingin."
"that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.","Pathien remti anga hlimtaka in kuomah ka hung a, ei hlim tlâng theina dingin."
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.,Remna Pathien chu in rênga kuomah um raw se. Amen.

And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.,"Chun, Remna Pathien chun, in kepha hnuoiah um dingin Setan chu hung suknawi vak a tih. Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna chu in kuomah um raw se."

And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.,Chuong thil thaw hlaktuhai chunga Pathienin a sawisêlna chu thu indiktak a nih ti ei hriet sih a.
"And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?","Aw mihriem, chuong ang thil thaw hlaktuhai sawisêltu, nangin chuong ang chu i thaw ve bawk sih a, Pathienin a sawisêlna chu pumpel în ring am a ni?"
"Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?","Annawleh, Pathien ṭhatnain simna dingin a ṭhuoi hlak che ti hre loin, a ṭhatna hauzie le, a en theizie le, a zaidaw theizie dâm chu i ngainêp am a nih?"
but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;,"I lulul le i lungril ngar leiin, lungsenna le Pathien rorêlna feltak hung inlang ding nia ding chun i chungah lungsenna în khâwlkhâwm a ni lem a nih."
who will render to every man according to his works:,"Pathien chun mi tin an sinthaw ang peiin rêlpêk a tih,"
"to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:","thil ṭha thaw fan fana, ropuina le chawimawina le bohmang thei nawna zawngtuhai kuoma chun kumkhuoa hringna pêng a tih."
"but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be wrath and indignation,","Amiruokchu, kâwmaw suoh a, thutak zâwm loa fel nawna zâwm lemtuhai chunga chun Pathien lung senna le lungawinawna um a tih."
"tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;","Rinumna le lungngaina nasatak, mihriem thil suksuol pohai thlarau chungah um a ta, Juda mi thlarau chungah um hmasâng a ta, chun, Grik mi thlarau chungah um nâwk a tih."
"but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:","Amiruokchu, thil ṭhataka thaw- tuhai po po kuoma chun ropuina dâm, chawimawina dâm, lung- muongna dâm pêk nîng a tih; Juda mihai kuomah pêk hmasak nîng a ta, chun, Grik mihai kuomah ni nâwk a tih."
for there is no respect of persons with God.,Pathienin mi ditsak bîk a nei si nawh a.
For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;,"Tûkhawm Dân nei loa thil suksuol chu Dân boin bohmang a ta; chun, tûkhawm Dân nei zinga suksuol chu, Dâna rêlpêkin um a tih."
"for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;","Dân hretu ringawthai chu Pathien mithmuin mi fel an ni nawh a, Dân anga thawtuhai chu mi fela tiemin um lem an tih."
"(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;","Dân nei naw Jentailhai hmanin an lungril insiengpuia dân thilhai kha an thawin, Dân nei naw hai sien khawm anni le anni chu dânah an insiem fâwm a,"
"in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them);","an lungrilah dân sinthaw chu ziek a nih ti an inentir a; chu chu an sie le ṭha hrietnain an hrietpui a, an lungrilhai chu ân sêl a, akâr leh thiem ân changtir vak a, akâr leh thiemnaw ân changtir vak a."
"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.",Pathienin ka Chanchin Ṭha hril anga mihriemhai thurûk Isu Krista hmanga a ngaituo ni chun chuong ang chu nîng a tih.
"But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,","Nisienlakhawm, nang Juda hming put i ni sih a, Dân chu i ringsan a, Pathien i suong a,"
"and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,","a dit zâwng i hriet a, Dân thu inchûktirin i um leiin thil ṭhatak chu ṭha i tih a,"
"and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,","nang ngei chu mitdelhai ṭhuoitu, inthima umhai êntu;"
"a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;","invêthai sukvartu le nautêhai inchûktirtu niin în ring a, Dâna chun varna le thutak um dân i nei leiin."
"thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?","Chuong ang i ni si chun, nang mi danghai inchûktirtu, nang le nang în chûktir naw am a nih?"
"thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?","Nang inru lo dinga mi dang hriltu, nangin în rûk hlak maw? Nang uire lo dinga mi dang hriltu, nang i uire maw? Nang milim theidatu, nangin milim biekna ina thilhai chu în rûk hlak maw?"
"thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?","Nang Dân suongtu, nangin Dân i bawsiet leiin Pathien chu i suk- hmingse hlak a ni maw?"
"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.","An ziek ang ngei khan, Pathien hming chu nangni leiin Jentailhai laiah sukpâwiin a um ta a ni hi."
"For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.",Dân zâwmtu i ni chun sertan chu a sâwt tak zet a nih; Dân bawsetu i ni ruok chun i sertan chu tan naw ang el a lo ni tah.
"If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?","Chuleiin, sertan naw mîn Dân thu ruothai chu a vawng chun, a sertan naw chu tan anga ngai a ni naw ding am a nih?"
"and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?","Chun, mani insieng ziea sertan loin Dân chu a zâwm kim chun, nang, lekha thu le sertan dân nei sia Dân bawsetu chu a sawisêl naw ding che maw?"
For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:,Ân lang ela Juda mi ni chu Juda mi tak a ni nawh a; ân langa taksa mei meia sertan chu sertan tak tak a ni chuong naw bawk.
"but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.","Amiruokchu, ân lang el ni loa Juda mi ni chu Juda tak a nih; chun, sertan tak chu lungril tienga tan a nih, Lekha thu ela ni loin, Thlarauah a nih; ama chun mihriem inpâk a hlaw nawh a, Pathien inpâk a hlaw lem hlak."
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?,Anleh Juda mi chun sâwtna ieng am a nei chuong bîk a? Sertan khawm chu a sâwtna ieng am a ni leh?
"Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.",Kawng tinrêngah a sâwt hle. Pathien thuhai an kuomah inkawl- tira a um lei a ni tak.
For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?,Anni laia ṭhenkhathai ringum nawhai sien khawm ieng am a ni chuong leh? An ringumnawna chun Pathien ringumzie chu ieng khawm niloin a siem chuong am a nih?
"God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.","Teu lo e! Pathien chu mi indiktak lo ni raw se, mi tin chu mi khêlhlip lo nihai sien khawm: “Nangin i thu hrilin thiem în changtir thei a, rorêlpêka i um khawma i hne theina dingin,” ti ziek ang khan."
"But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)","Nisienlakhawm, ei fel nawnahai hin Pathien felna chu a suklang mawi zuol si chun ieng am hril ei ta? Pathienin mi a hrem hin, mi fel lo a ni am a nih? (Mihriem dân takin hril ta inla)."
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?,Teu lo e! Chuong a ni chun Pathienin iengtin am khawvêl ro rêl a ta?
"But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?","Nisienlakhawm, ka khêl hril leia Pathien thu indikzie ama sukropui khawp raua ân lang nâwk pei chun, ieng dinga kei khawm mi suol anga thiemnaw inchangtira la um rawp am ka na?"
"and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.","Mîn an mi hêk a, mi ṭhenkhatin ka hril naw tawp an mîn hriltir angin ieng dinga, “Thil ṭha a hung theina dingin thil suol thâwng ei tiu,” tiin ei hril lem naw? Chuong ang mihai chun thiemnaw an chang chu a fel a nih."
"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;","Annawleh, eini Judahai hi anni nêkin ei ṭha chuong bîk am a nih? Teu lo e! Judahai le Grikhai chu angkhat rawnga suolna suoka um vawng ei nih ti hi hma khawmin ei hril ta kha;"
"as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;","“Tukhawm mi fel hrim an um nawh. Pakhat bêk khawm an um nawh,"
"There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;","Tûkhawm a hre thiem hrim an um nawh, Tûkhawm Pathien zawng hrim an um nawh."
"They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:","A ni naw tieng an pêt vawng tah a, Ienga khawm hmang tlâk loin an um vawng tah a; Tûkhawm thil ṭha thaw hrim an um nawh; Pakhat bêk khawm an um nawh."
Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:,"An hnuk chu thlân inhawng a na, An leiin inhlêmna thu a hril a, An bau sûngah rûl tûr a um a,"
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:,An bau chu ṭawngseinphurna le thu khain a sip a.
Their feet are swift to shed blood;,An ke chu thisen insuo dingin a pên hrât a;
Destruction and misery are in their ways;,An lampuia chun bohmangna le rinumna a um a.
And the way of peace have they not known:,Lungmuongna lampui khawm an hriet nawh.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.,"An mithmuah Pathien ṭina hrim a um nawh,” ti ziek ang khan."
"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:","Dânin iengkhawm a hril taphawt chu Dân thu thua umhai kuomah a hril a nih ti ei hriet a, bau tinrêng hupa a um theina ding le, khawvêla mi po po Pathien rorêla an um theina dingin."
because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin.,"Chuongchun, mi tukhawm Dâna thilthaw leiin a mithmuah thiem changin um naw ni hai; Dân leiin suol hriet famkimna a hung um a ni sih a."
"But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin Dân ṭhang loa Pathien felna chu suk- langin a um tah; Dân le zâwlneihai thu khawma a hril kha a nih;"
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;,"chu chu Pathien felna, Isu Krista ringna leia ama awitu taphawt kuoma suklanga um chu a nih; a danglamna hrim a um nawh a."
"for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;","Mi po poin thil an suksuol vawng tah a, Pathien ropuina an chang zo ta naw a nih."
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:,"Chuong a ringtuhai chu Krista Isua intlanna um lei chun, lungin- sietnaa a thlâwna thiem inchangtirin an um a."
"whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;",Pathienin ama felzie inentir dingin Krista Isu chu a thisen ringnaa suol thuphachawina dingin a ruot a. Pathien zaidawtheinain in- hmaa suolnahai chu hriet naw tehlêm a thaw a nih.
"for the showing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.",Ama ngei chu mi fel a nizie le Isua ringna nei taphawt thiem inchangtirtu a ni zie tulaia inentirna dingin a nih.
Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.,"Insuongna chu khâwlai am a um leh? A puo tienga khâr nelin a um tah. Ieng dânin am a na? Thilthaw dânin am a nih? Ni lo e, Ringna dânin a ni lem."
We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.,"Chuongchun, Dân thil thaw lei ni loin, ringna leiin miin thiem chang dingin ei ngai a nih."
"Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:",Pathien chu Judahai Pathien chau am a nih? Jentailhai Pathien khaw m a ni ve naw am a nih? Ni veh e.
"if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.","Sertanhai chu an ring leia thiem inchangtirtu ding le, sertan- nawhai chu an ring leia thiem inchangtirtu Pathien pakhat chau a ni si chun, Jentailhai Pathien khawm ni ve ngei naw ni."
"Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.","Anleh, ringna lei ngawtin Dân chu iengkhawm ni loin ei siem el am a nih? Teu lo e! Dân chu ei sukdet lem hman a nih."
"What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?","Anleh, Abraham, tisa dâna ei thlatu chun a hmu ieng am hril ei ta?"
"For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.","Abrahamin a thilthaw leiin thiem a chang si chun, suong ding a nei a nih; Pathien tieng ruok chun a nei nawh a;"
"For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.","Pathien Lekhain ieng am a hril a? “Abraham chun Pathien a ring a, chu ringna chu a felnaa ngai a nih,” tiin a hril a nih."
"Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.","Chun, sinthawtu hlaw chu lunginsietnaa ngai a ni nawh a, bat anga ngai a ni lem a nih."
"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.","Amiruokchu, mi, a thilthawa innghat loa, Pathien hre nawhai thiem inchangtirtu ring lemtu ringna chu, a felnaa ngai a nih."
"Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,","Mi, a thilthaw ngaituo loa, Pathienin fela a ingaihai hamṭhatzie chu David khawmin:-"
"saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.","“An bawsietnahai ngaidama umhai le, An suolhai inkhuma um chu An hamṭha."
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.,"Lalpain suol neia a ingai naw chu an hamṭha,” tia a hril ang khan."
"Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.","Anleh, chu hamṭhatna chu sertanhai chung chau âm a ni a um, sertan nawhai chunga khawm? “Abraham ringna chu a felnaa ruot a nih” ei ti sih a."
"How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:","Chu chu iengti ziea ngai am ni tâng a ta? A sertan hmain am a ni, a sertan hnungin? A sertan hnungin a ni nawh a, a sertan hmain a ni lem a nih."
"and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;","Chuongchun, sertan loa a um laia, ringnain felna chu a hmu ti inhrietna, sertan inchikna chu a hmuh a, chu felna chu an ta dinga ruot a nina dingin sertan lohai laia ringtuhai po po pa a ni theina dingin,"
"and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.","sertanhai pa khawm a ni thei bawkna dingin– sertanhai pa chau a ni nawh a, ama, ei pa Abraham sertan loa a um laia, ringna a nei anga nei fâwmhai pa a ni lem a nih."
"For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.","Dân leiin Abraham le a thlahai kuoma chun khawvêl ro hluo ding thu chu tiem a ni nawh a, ringnaa felna lei a ni lem."
"For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:","Dâna mihai rohluotuhai an ni si chun, ringna ienga khawm hmang a ni ta nawh a, thutiem khawm chu iengkhawm a ni ta nawh;"
"for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.",Dân chun lunginsenna a siem hlak sih a; Dân um nawnaa chun bawsietna khawm a um bawk nawh.
"For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all","Chuleiin, lunginsietna a ni theina dingin, ringna leiin a nih hi suon po pohai chun thutiem chu matheiloa an hmu chu. Dân nei mi chauin an hmu ding a ni nawh a, Abraham ringna ang ringna neihai khawmin hmûng an tih. Abraham chu ei rênga pa a nih,"
"(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.","mithihai sukhringtu le, thil umnawhai a taka inumtirtu, a iring Pathien mithmua chun; “Chi tam- takhai pain siem ka ti che” tia ziek ang khan."
"Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.","Beiseina âwm a um naw khawmin beiseitakin a ring a, chi tamtakhai pa a hung ni theina dingin, “Khi zât khin i thlahai la um an tih,” tia hril ang khan."
"And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;","Chun, ringna detlo chuong loin, a taksa thi tah anga um chu a ngaituoh a, ama chu kum za lai mi a ni sih a, Sara ching khawm a ngaituo bawk a."
"yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,","Nisienlakhawm, ringna tlasam- in Pathien thutiem chu a ringhla chuong nawh a, Pathien a châwimawi a;"
"and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.","a thutiem chu ân hlawtling tir thei ti a ring hle bawk a, a ringna chu a hung det lem tah a."
Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.,Chuleiin a ringna chu a felnaa ngai a hung ni tah.
"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;","Chuongchun, a ringna chu a felnaa ngai a ni ti ama ta ding chaua ziek a ni nawh a,"
"but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,","Isu, ei Lalpa mithi laia inthawka keithotu ringtu einihai ta ding khawmin a nih, ei ringna chu felnaa ngai nîng a tih."
"who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.","Chu Isu chu ei suolna leiin inmantirin a um a, thiem ei changna dingin keithoin a um bawk a."
"Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;","Chuleiin, ringna leia thiem changa umin, ei Lalpa Isu Krista leiin Pathien le inremin ei um a;"
through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.,"ama lei bawk chun hi lungin- sietnaa ei ngir detnaa hin ringnain ei lût tah a, Pathien ropuina beiseiin lâwmin ei um bawk a nih."
"And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;","Chu chau chu ni loin, ei rimsiknaa khawm lâwmin ei um a nih, rimsikna chun selna a siem a,"
"and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:","tuorselna chun hriet fiena a siem a, hriet fiena chun beiseina a siem ti ei hriet sih a."
and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.,"Chun, Thlarau Inthieng ei kuoma a mi pêk khan Pathien hma- ngaina chu ei lungrilah a hung buok ta leiin beiseina chun a mi sukbeidawng nawh a."
"For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.",Ei la hrât naw lai khan a hun takah Krista chu mi suolhai ai chun a lo thi ta sih a.
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.,"Mi fel aia thi miin a nuom naw âwm hle sih a, mi ṭha ai ruok chun mi tûamani bêk chun thi a lo ngam khiet rawi mawh."
"But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun a mi hmangaina chu inpâk tlâkin ân langtir a, mi suolhai ei la ni laia Krista eini aia a thinaa khan."
"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him.","Chuongchun, a thisena thiem inchangtira ei um ta hin chu, ama lei bawkin Pathien lungsennaa in- thawkin sandamin um ngei ei tih."
"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;","Hmêlma ei ni lai hmana, a Naupa thina leia Pathien le lo inrem tah ei ni chun, inrema ei um ta hnung lem hin chu a hringna leiin sandamin um ngei ei tih."
"and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.","Chuong chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, inremna tuta a mîn hmutirtu ei Lalpa Isu Krista lei chun Pathienah ei lâwm bawk a nih."
"Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:—","Chuongchun, mi pakhat leiin suol khawvêla hin a lût a, suol leiin thina a lût bawk a; chuong ang bawkin mi po poin thil an lo suksuol ta leiin thinain mi po po a fang suok tah a."
for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.,Dân um hmain suol khawvêlah a um ta sih a; dân a um si naw chun suol chu suola ngai a ni nawh.
"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.","Nisienlakhawm, Adama in- thawk Mosie um chenin Adam bawsietna anga thil suksuol nawhai chunga khawm thina chun ro a rêl hlak a. Adam chu la hung dingpa hlimthla chu a nih."
"But not as the trespass, so also is the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.","Nisienlakhawm, thilthlâwnpêk chu bawsietna leh ân ang nawh. Mi pakhat bawsietna lei hman khan mi tamtak chu an thi si chun, Pathien lunginsietna le mi pakhat Isu Krista lunginsietna leia thilpêk chu, mi tamtak chungah vurin um ngei a tih."
"And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification.","Chun, chu thilpêk chu mi pakhat suol leia thil hung um le chun ân ang bawk nawh; thiemnaw inchangtirna rorêlna chu mi pakhat leiin a hung um a, thiem inchang- tirna thilthlâwnpêk ruok chu bawsietna tamtak leiin a hung um ta lem a nih."
"For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.","Mi pakhat bawsietna leiin, mi pakhat lei hmana thinain ro a rêl si chun, lunginsietna nasatak le felna thilpêk lo changtuhai khan mi pakhat Isu Krista lei khan hringnaa chun ro rêl ngei an tih."
So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life.,"Chuongchun, mi pakhat baw- sietna leiin, thiemnaw inchangtirna rorêlna chu mi po po chungah a hung um a; chuong ang bawkin thil fel pakhat thaw lei chun, hringna hmu- na dinga thiem inchangtirna thil- thlâwnpêk chu mi po po chungah a hung um."
"For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.",Mi pakhat thu awi nawna lei khan mi tamtak chu mi suol an hung ni tah; chuong ang bawkin mi pakhat thuawi lei khan mi tamtak chu mi fel hung nîng an tih.
"And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:","Chun, bawsietna chu ân lang nawk zuol theina dingin Dân a hung um nâwk nghâl a. Nisienlakhawm, suol a pungna poah lunginsietna chu a pung zuol pei hlak;"
"that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.","suol chun thinain ro a rêl ang takin, lunginsietna chun, felnain kumkhaw hringna changna khawp hielin ei Lalpa Isu Krista zârah ro a rêl theina dingin."
"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Lunginsietna chu a pung nâwk zuolna dingin suolin ei um zing ding am a nih?
"God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?",Teu lo e a! Eini suol tienga thi ta hnunghai iengtin am suolin la hring zing thei ei ta?
Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?,"Eini laia Krista Isua baptisma changhai po chu, a thinaah baptisin ei um ti in hriet naw maw?"
"We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.","Chuleiin, a thinaa baptisma ei changin, a kuomah phûmin ei um veh a; Pa ropuinain mithi laia inthawka Krista a keitho ang khan, eini khawm hringna thara ei um theina dingin."
"For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection;","A thina inangpuia ama leh ei inzawm ta si chun, a thonâwkna in- angpuia khawm inzawm bawk ei tih."
"knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;","Hieng hi ei hriet; ei mihriem hlui chu a kuoma hemdein a um ve tah, suol taksa chu sukboa a um theina dinga, tuta chen chu suol suoka ei um ta nawna dingin."
for he that hath died is justified from sin.,Tûkhawm a thi ta chu suola inthawkin a suok ta sih a.
"But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;","Chun, Krista kuomah ei thi ve ta chun, a kuomah hring ve bawk ei tih, ti ei ring a nih;"
knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.,"Krista chu mithi laia inthawka keithoin a um a, a thi nâwk ta naw ding a nih, ti ei hriet sih a."
"For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.","Thina chun ama chungah thu a nei ta nawh. A thina chu suol tieng kawnga kumkhuoa dingin vawikhat chau a thi a na, a hringna ruok chu Pathien tieng kawnga hring a nih."
"Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni khawm suol tieng kawngah thi taah inngai unla, Pathien tieng kawnga ruok chun Krista Isua chun hringah inngai ro."
"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:","Chuleiin, in taksa nuom zâwng ang in zâwmna dingin, in taksa thi theia chun suolnain ro rêl naw raw se."
"neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.","In taksa pênghai khawm fel nawna hriemhrei dingin suolna kuomah pe phal bawk naw ro; nisienlakhawm, mithi laia inthawka hring nâwk angin Pathien kuomah inpe unla, in taksa pênghai khawm chu felna hriemhrei dingin Pathien kuomah pe phal lem ro."
"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.","Suolnain in chungah thu a nei ta naw ding a ni sih a, Dân rorêla um in ni nawh a, lunginsietna rorêla um in ni lem sih a."
"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.","Iengtin am nîng a ta? Dân rorêla um ei ni nawh a, lunginsietna rorêla um ei ni lem lei hin ei suol ding am a nih? Teu lo e a!"
"Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?","Tu kuoma khawm an thu awi dinga an suoka in lût chun, thina khawpa suol suok amanih, felna khawpa thuawina suok amani khawm ni sienla, a thu in iawi suok chu in nih ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
"But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;","Amiruokchu, Pathien kuomah lâwmthu um raw se! suol suok ni unla khawm inchûktir dân,a kuoma in inpêkna chu lungril tak zetin in lo awi a;"
"and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.","chun, suola inthawk chu insuoin in um a, felna suokhai in hung ni ta sih a."
"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification.","(In taksa hrât nawna leiin mihriem dânin thu ka hril a nih). In taksa pênghai chu inthieng nawna kuoma le bawsietna dinga bawsietna kuomah suoka in pêk phal ang khan, tuhin in taksa pênghai chu inthiengna dingin felna kuomah suok dingin pe phal ro."
"For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.",Suolna suokhai in ni lai khan felna tieng chu in fihlim a nih.
What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.,Tuta in thil inzâpui tahaia hin khâng lai khan ra ieng am in lo hmu hlak leh? Khang thil tâwpna kha thina a nih in sawnnaw.
"But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.","Tu ruok hin chu suola inthawka sukfihlîma um a, Pathien suokhai in hung ni hin, inthiengna hmu khawpin ra in nei in sawnnaw; chu chu tâwpna kumkhuoa hringna leh."
For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.,Suol man chu thina a ni sih a; Pathien thilthlâwnpêk ruok chu ei Lalpa Krista Isu zârah chatuona hringna a nih.
"Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?","Anleh, unauhai, dân chun mi a dam sûng po a chungah ro a rêl hlak ti in hriet naw am an nih? (Dân hre mihai kuomah ka hril a ni hi)."
"For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.","Nuhmei pasal nei chu a pasal dam sûng po dânin a pasala khuopdein a um hlak; nisien- lakhawm, a pasal a thi chun, pasal kawngah dâna inthawka insuoin a um hlak."
"So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.","Chuongchun, a pasal dam sûnga mi dang a nei chun “uirenu” tîng an tih; a pasal a thi ruok chun, chu dâna inthawk chun inthlain a um a; chuongchun, mi dang nei sien khawm uire a ni ta nawh."
"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.","Chuongchun, unauhai, Krista taksa pêng in ni leiin dân kawnga sukhlumin in lo um tah a, mi dang, mithi laia inthawka a keitho kha, in nei thei tah, Pathien tienga kan ra theina dingin."
"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.",Tisaa ei um lai khan Dân leia nuom zâwng suol hung suokhai chun ei taksa pêngahai thina khawpa ra dingin sin a hung thaw hlak.
"But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.","Tu ruok hin chu a mi cheltu chu thisanin, Dâna inthawkin inthlain ei um tah; chuleichun lekha ziek hlui ang ni loin, Thlarau tharin rawng ei bâwl theina dingin."
"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:","Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Dân chu suol am a nih? Teu lo e a; Nisien- lakhawm, Dân leia hriet ni naw sien chu suol ka hriet naw ding bah; Dân chun, “Inhnar naw,” ti naw sien chu inhnar hi ka hriet naw ding bah."
"but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin is dead.","Nisienlakhawm, suolin thupêk lei chun remchâng lai hmuin, inhnarna tinrêng ka sûngah ân umtir a. Dân naw chun suolna chu a thi a nih."
"And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;","Chun, kha hma khan kei dân nei loin ka hring a; nisienlakhawm, thupêk chu a hung um phingleh suolna chu a hung har a, kei chu ka thi tah a."
"and the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death:","Chun, hringna dinga thupêk chu thina ding lem a nih ti ka hung hriet tah a;"
"for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.","suolna chun thupêk lei chun, remchângna hmuin a mi lo hlêm a, thupêk chu hmangin a mi sukhlum tah a nih."
"So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.","Chuongchun, Dân chu ân thieng a, thupêk khawm chu ân thieng a, a fel a, a ṭha a nih."
"Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;—that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.","Anleh, thil ṭha chu keia ta dingin thina a lo ni am a nih? Teu lo e a! Suolna chu keia ta dingin thina a hung ni ta lem a nih; chuongchun, suolna chu suolna a nih ti ân lang theina dingin, thil ṭha chu hmangin a mi sukhlum a nih. Suolna chu thupêk lei khan suol nasatak a ni theina dingin."
"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.","Dân chu Thlarau tieng thil a nih ti ei hriet sih a; kei ruok chu tisa tienga mi, suol suoka zawr ta hnung ka nih."
"For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.","Sin ka thawhai hi a ngaina ka hriet si nawh a, ka thaw hlakhai hi ka thaw nuom zâwng khawm a ni si nawh a; ka itheida zâwngtak chu ka thaw lem hlak a nih."
"But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.","Ka thaw nuom naw zâwng chu ka thaw si chun, Dân chu a ṭha tia awi nîng ka tih."
"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.","Chuongchun, thil ka thawhai hi keiin ka thaw a ni ta nawh a, suolna keimaa um chun a thaw a ni lem a nih."
"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good is not.","Keimaa hin, chu chu ka tisaa hin tina a nih, thil ṭha hrim a um nawh ti ka hriet, thil ṭha thaw nuomna chu keimaah a umdea chu, thil ṭha thawna chu a um si nawh a."
"For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.","Ṭhatna thaw ka nuoma chu ka thaw naw a, suolna ka thaw nuom naw chu ka thaw sih a."
"But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.","Ka nuom naw zâwng ka thaw si chun, a thawtu chu kei ka ni ta nawh a, suol keimaa um chu a ni lem a nih."
"I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.","Chuongchun, hi dân hi ka hung hriet suok tah; thil ṭha thaw ka nuom laiin suolna ka kuomah a hung um hlak a nih."
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:,Ka lungril takin Pathien dân chungah ka lâwm si hlak a;
"but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.","nisienlakhawm, ka taksa pêng- haia hin dân danglam a um ti ka hriet, chu chun ka lungrila dân chu a do a, ka taksa pênghaia suolna dân umhai chun salah a mi ṭhuoi a nih."
Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?,Mi rimsi ka va ni ngei de aw! Hi thina taksaa inthawk hin tuin am mi sansuok a ta?
"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.","Isu Krista ei Lalpa lei chun Pathien kuomah lâwmthu ka hril a nih. Chuongchun, keima tak chun, ka lungril chun, Pathien dân rawng ka bâwl hlak, ka tisa ruok chun suolna dân rawng ka bâwl hlak."
There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.,"Chuongchun, tuhin chu Krista Isua umhai ta ding chun thiem- naw inchangtirna hrim a um ta nawh."
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.,Krista Isua Hringna Thlarau dân chun suolna le thina dâna inthawk chun a mi sansuok ta sih a.
"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:","Tisa leiin Dân chu a hrât nawh a, a thaw thei ruol naw chu Pathienin ama Naupa ngei tisa suol ang putin suol thawina dinga hung tirin, tisaa suolna um chu thiemnaw ân changtir tah a nih,"
"that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.","tisa dân hraw lo a, Thlarau dân hraw lemtu einia hin Dân thu ruot chu hlena a um theina dingin."
For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.,Tisa dâna umhai chun tisa tieng thilhai an dit hlak; Thlarau dâna umhai ruok chun thlarau tieng thilhai an dit hlak. Tisa tieng thil dit chu thina a ni sih a;
For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:,Thlarau tieng thil dit ruok chu hringna le lungmuongna a nih;
"because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:","tisa dit zâwng chu Pathien dona a ni sih a. Chu chu Pathien dânin a um nghâl si nawh a, um khawm a um thei bawk nawh."
and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.,"Chuleiin, tisaa umhai chun Pathien an suklâwm thei nawh."
"But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.","Chuongchun, Pathien Thlarau chu nangniah a chêng takzet a ni chun, tisaa um ni loin, Thlaraua um in ni lem. Tukhawm Krista Thlarau nei naw chu ama mi a ni nawh."
"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.","Krista chu nangniah a um ruok chun, in taksa chu suolna leia thi khawm ni sien, Pathiena thiem changa um in ni leiin in thlarau chu a hring a nih."
"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.","Nisienlakhawm, mithi laia inthawka Isu keitho nâwktu Thlarau kha nangniah a um chun, mithi laia inthawka Krista Isu keitho nâwktu khan nangnia um Thlarau zâra chun, in taksa thi theihai chu sukhring bawk a tih."
"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:","Chuleichun, unauhai, bat ei nei, tisa dâna um lo dingin, tisa kuoma khawm ni bawk loin."
"for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.","Tisa dâna in um chun in thi ngei ding a nih; amiruokchu, taksa thil- thawhai chu Thlaraua in sukhlum hlak chun hring in tih."
"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.",Pathien Thlarau ṭhuoia umhai po chu Pathien nauhai an ni sih a.
"For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.","Ṭia um nâwk dingin suok nina thlarau in hmu a ni si nawh a; nau nina thlarau in hmu lem a nih; chu thlarau zâra chun, “Abba! (Pa)” tiin ei khêk hlak hi."
"The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:","Thlarau ngei chun, eini thlarau leh, Pathien nauhai ei nih ti a mîn hriettir hlak."
"and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.","Chun, nauhai ei ni chun ro- hluotuhai, Pathien rohluotu, Krista hluopuituhai ei nih; chuleiin, ama ei tuorpui ding a nih, a kuoma chawimawia ei um ve theina dingin."
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.,Tulaia tuornahai hi ei chunga ropuina suklanga la um ding le chun hrilkhi khawpa ka ngai si nawh a.
For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.,Thilsiemhai chun beiseitakin Pathien nauhai hung inlangna chu an nghâkhla hle sih a.
"For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope","Thilsiem po pohai chu, thil teplo thu thua inumtirin an um tah; an nuoma um an ni nawh a, ân umtirtu lei a ni lem a nih."
that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.,"Beiseina neiin thilsiemhai po po khawm chu sietna suoka inthawka insuoin um an ta, Pathien nauhai zalênna ropuia chun an lût ding a ni sih a."
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.,Thilsiem po pohai chu tu chen hin inrûm le nauhasena tuorin an um tâwl ti ei hriet sih a.
"And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.","Chu chau khawm chu ni loin, eini, Thlarau rahmasa neituhai ngei khawm hin, nau ei nina (ei taksa intlanna) chu nghâkin, eini meu khawm ei lungrilin ei inrûm sih a."
For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?,"Beiseinain a nih, sandama ei um chu; nisienlakhawm, hmu thei zing beiseina hi beiseina a ni nawh a, miin a hmu thei zing chu iengtin am a la beisei hlak a?"
"But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.",Ei hmu naw chu ei beisei chun ei nghâk fan fan hlak a nih.
And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;,"Chuong ang bawkin, Thlarau chun ei hrât nawnahaiah a mi ṭhang- pui hlak a; ieng anga ṭawngṭai ding am a ni ti ei hriet si nawh a; nisienlakhawm, Thlarau chun inrûm hril ruol loin a mi ṭawngṭai pêk hlak."
"and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.","Chun, Pathien dit zâwng ang peiin mi inthienghai chu a ṭawngṭai pêk hlak leiin, lungrilhai entu chun Thlarau dit zâwng chu a hriet hlak a nih."
"And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, even to them that are called according to his purpose.","Chun, Pathien hmangaituhai amain a ruot anga a kohai ta ding chun, an ṭhatna dingin iengkimin a thawpêk hlak ti ei hriet a."
"For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:","A hrietlâwkhai chu ama Naupa ang taka um dingin a ruot lâwk sih a, a Naupa chu unau tamtak laia nau lutîr a hung ni theina dingin."
"and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.","Chun, a ruot lâwkhai chu a ko bawk a; a kohai chu thiem ân changtir bawk a; chun, thiem ân changtir hai chu a châwimâwi bawk a."
"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?",Chuong thua chun ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Pathien eini tieng a ṭhang chun tuin am mi do thei a ta?
"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?","Ama naupa ngei khawm hla loa, ei rênga aia petu chun, thil dang po po khawm a thlâwnin a mi pêk sa naw ding am a nih?"
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;,Pathien mi thlanghai chu tuin am hêk a ta? Thiem inchangtirtu kha Pathien a ni sih a.
"who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.","Tuin am thiemnaw inchangtir a ti leh? A thi chu Isu Krista chu a ni sih a, anih, mithi laia inthawka tho nâwk ta lem a, Pathien changtienga uma a mi hrilpêktu bawk kha a nih."
"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?","Krista hmangainaa inthawk chu tuin am mi ṭhêng a ta? Rinum- nain amanih, lungngainain amanih, suknawmnatnain amanih, ṭâmin amanih, saruoknain amanih ṭiumin amanih, kâwlhnâmin amanih a mi ṭhe ding am a nih?"
"Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.","“Nangma leiin sûnnithlâkin thatin kan um hlak; Berâm that ding anga ngai kan nih,” tia ziek ang khan."
"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.","Ṭhe lo e! chuong po poa chun, a mi hmangaitu lei chun ropuitaka hnetu ei nih."
"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,","Chiengtakin ka hriet a nih; thina dâm, hringna dâm, vântirko dâm, inlalna dâm, thil umsa le a la um ding dâm,"
"nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.","thilthawtheina dâm, insângna dâm, inthûkna dâm, thilsiem dang hrim hrim khawmin ei Lalpa Krista Isua um Pathien hmangainaa inthawk chun mi ṭhe naw ni."
"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,","Kristaa chun thu taktak ka hril a nih, khêl ka hril nawh, Thlarau Inthieng zâra chun,a ka sie le ṭha hrietna khawmin a mi hrietpui a,"
that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.,ka lungrila hin rinumna nasatak le lungngaina bo thei naw ka nei in sawnnaw.
"For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:","Ka unauhai, tisa tienga ka chipuihai aiin, kei hi Krista kuoma inthawka ṭhe thlâk khawp hiela thusie phurin um lang ka ti lem a nih,"
"who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;","Israel mi an ni sih a; nau nina dâm, ropuina dâm, thuthlung po po dâm, Dân pêkna dâm, Pathien rawngbâwlna dâm, thutiemhai po po an ta a nih;"
"whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.","thlatu bulhai chu an ta a ni bawk a, tisa tieng thuah Krista chu anni laia inthawka hung suok a ni sih a; ama chu thil tinrêng chunga um a na, chatuona inpâk tlâk Pathien a nih. Amen."
"But it is not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien thu chu iengkhawm ni lo anga um ta a ni nawh a. Israelhai chu Israel mi an ni vawng chuong nawh."
"neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.","Abraham thlahai an ni leiin an rêngin a nauhai an ni chuong bawk nawh; “Isaka hin i thlahai tîng an tih,” ti a ni lem."
"That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.","Chu chu, tisa nauhai chu Pathien nauhai an ni nawh a, thutiem nauhai chu Abraham thlaa ngai an nih tina a nih:"
"For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.","Thutiem chu hi hi a nih: “Tu phâ ang hin hung ka ta, Sara chun naupasal nei a tih,” ti hi."
"And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, even by our father Isaac—","Chu chau chu a ni nawh a, Rebeka khawma mi pakhat ei pa Isaka inthawka phîr a vawn lai khan,"
"for the children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,","naute chu an la suok hmaa, a sie le aṭha an la hriet hmain thil thaw lei ni loin,"
"it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.","a kotu dit lei ni lemin, thlang tieng thua Pathien thu ruot chu a det theina dingin, a kuoma chun, “A upa lemin a naupang lem rawng bâwl a tih,” Pathienin a ti kha."
"Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.","“Jakob chu ka hmangai a, Esau chu ka theida,” tia ziek ang khan."
What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.,Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Pathiena chun fel nawna a um am a nih? Teu lo e a!
"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.","Ama chun, “Ka lunginsiethai po chu lunginsiet ka ta, zâ ka ngainahai po chunga chun za ngai ka tih,” tiin Mosie kuomah a hril si kha."
"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.","Chuleiin, a dittu lei a ni nawh a, a hnawttu lei a ni bawk nawh, a lunginsiettu Pathien lei a ni lem a nih."

"So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.","Chuongchun, Pathienin a nuom po a lunginsiet a, a nuom po a suklulul hlak a nih."

"What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:","Lunginsenna bêl bohmang tlâkhai chunga chun, Pathienin a lunginsenna le a thilthawtheina inlangtir nuom sien khawm, a daw hrâm hrâm chun ieng am pawi a ta?"
"and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,","Lunginsietna bêl, ropui dinga a lo buotsai lâwkhai chunga chun a lunginsietna hau zie ân entir theina ding a ni phawt chun."
"even us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?","Chu lunginsietna bêlhai chu Judahai lai chau ni loin, Jentailhai laia inthawka kohai khawm ei nih."
"As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.","Hosea lekhabua, “Ka mihai ni ngai lo chu, ‘Ka mihai’ tîng ka ta, Chun, ka ihmangai ngainawnu chu, ‘Hmangainu’ tîng ka tih."
"And it shall be, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God.","Chun, hieng hi hung nîng a ta, an kuoma, ‘Ka mihai in ni nawh,’ tia an umna hmun ngeia chun, Pathien hring nauhai inbûkin um an tih,” tia a hril ang ngei khan."
"And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:","Isai khawma Israelhai thu khêkpuiin, “Israel mihai chu tuisuorieta phaiphin zâtin tam hai sien khawm, a ihrem bâk chau chu sandamin um an tih."
"for the Lord will execute his word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.","Lalpa chun inrangtakin hnuoi chunga a rorêlna chu a hlen ding a ni sih a,” a ti kha."
"And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.","Isai bawkin, “Mipuihai Lalpa chun chithlâtu mi lo hlapêk naw sien chu, Sodom angin lo um tâng ei ta, Gomorra anga siemin lo um tâng ei tih,” tia a lo hrillâwk ta ang khan."
"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:","Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Jentail, felna hnawt nawhai chun felna an lo phâk tah a nih — ringna leia felna chu."
"but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.","Israel, felna dân hnawttuhai ruok chun felna dân chu an phâk zo ta nawh."
"Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;","Ieng lei am a na? Ringna leh an hnawt nawh a, thilthawa an hnawt lei a nih. Tlûkna lunga chun an tlu ta sih a;"
"even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.","“Ngai ta, Ziona chun Tlûkna lung le, Dangna lungpui ka sie a; Tûkhawm ama ring taphawt chu Muolpho naw ni,” tia ziek ang khan."
