"Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):","Hieng hi Jakob ruola Aiguptaa hung thla Israel naupasalhai hming chu an nih, mi tin a sûnghai pei leh:"

"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,","Issakar, Zebulun le Benjamin,"
"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.","Dan le Naphtali, Gad le Aser hi."
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.,Jakob ṭhalbea inthawka suok- hai po chu mi sâwmsari an nih; Josef ruok chu Aiguptaah a lo um ta hrim a.
"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.","Chun, Josef le a unauhai po le, chu ṭhanga mi po chu an thi tah a."
"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel thlahai chu an hung sûngruol a, tamtaka hung inbelsain an hung pung a, nasataka thilthawtheiin an hung um a; ram chu anni hluo sipin a um tah a."
"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.",Tuhin Aiguptaa chun Josef hre ngailo lal thar a hung inlal tah a.
"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:","A mihai kuoma chun, “En ta u, Israel thlahai hi eini nêkin an tam hlein thil an thaw thei lem bêk a;"
"come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.","hung ro, anni hi vartakin sawisâng ei tiu; chuong naw chun hung pung an ta; indona ieng khawm a hung suok pha, anni hin ei hmêlmahai chu ṭhangpuiin mi do an ta, hi rama inthawk hi tlân suok rawi an tih,” a tih a."
"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.","Chuleiin, phurrik takhaia anni sukrinum dingin, an chungah sin- thawhotuhai an siempêk ta ngei a.

"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm anni chu an sukrimsi po leh an pung zuol deu deuin, an indar lien deu deu lem tah a.

And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chu inrimtakin sin an inthawtir a;"
"and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.","an sinthaw po po, lo sin kawng tinrênga le lung rawtnawinaa le ṭêklei siemnaa sin intaktakhai chu rimsitaka inthawtirin an nunhai an sukrinumpêk tah a."
"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:","Chun, Aigupta lal chun Hebrai naudawmtuhai kuoma chun thu a hril tah a; chuhai pakhat hming chu Siphra, a dang hming chu Pua a nih;"

"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.","Nisienlakhawm, naudawmtu- hai chun Pathien an ṭih a, Aigupta lalin anni thu a pêk angin an thaw nawh a, nautê pasalhai chu an sanhim lem tah a."
"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?","Chun, Aigupta lal chun nau- dawmtuhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Iengdinga hi thil hi in thawh a, naupasalhai chu a hringa hla am in nih a?” a tih a."
"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.","Naudawmtuhai chun Pharao kuomah, “Hebrai nuhmeihai chu Aigupta nuhmeihai ang an ni nawh a, anni chu an hrisêl a, naudawmtuhai an kuom an tlung hma hin nau chu an lo nei ta hlak a nih,” an tih a."
"And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.","Pathienin naudawmtuhai chu ṭhatakin a ngaisak a; Hebrai mihai chu an hung pung a, thilthawtheitak an hung ni tah a."
"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.",Naudawmtuhai chun Pathien an ṭi leiin Pathienin sûngkuoahai a siem tah a.

"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Pharao kuomah va lût la, hieng ka inchiknahai hi anni lai ngeia kân entir theina dingin a siehlawhai le ama lungril ngei khawm chu ka sukngar tah a nih;"

"Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:","Ka mihai în fetir phal naw chun, ngai rawh, i ram sûngah, zinga leh khâuhai hung ṭhuoi ka ta;"
"and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:","hnuoi chung po po chu a dâpin hung dâp an ta, hnuoi chu mi hmu theilo khawp hielin um a tih.

"and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.","I inhai le i siehlaw po po inhai le Aigupta mi po po inhai chu sip vawng an ta, i pahai le i thlatuhai khawmin, hi hnuoi chunga an uma inthawk vawisûn ni chen hin chuong ang chu la hmu ngai naw bawk an tih,’ a tih,” a tih a.

"And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah.","Mosie chun, “LALPA kuoma chun ruoi kan ṭhe ding a ni sih a, kan naupanghai le kan tarhai leh, kan naupasalhai kan naunuhmeihai leh, kan bâwng ruolhai le kan berâm ruolhai leh fêng kan tih,” a tih a."
"And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.","Pharao chun, “LALPA chu in kuomah um raw se; nangni le in nauhai le chu kân fetir tâk cheu leh! En ta u, thiltum ṭhanawtak in nei a ni hi."
"Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire.

"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Khâuhai hungna dingin Aigupta ram chungah i bân phar rawh; Aigupta rama an hung a, a rama hna hring tinrêng, rielin a suksiet mahla chu an fâk vawngna dingin,” a tih a."
"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aigupta ram chunga chun a hmawl chu ân let tah a; chun, LALPA chun chu ni sûnnithlak le zânkhawvârin ram chunga chun sak thli ân hrângtir a; chun, zîngtieng a hung ni chun, sak thli chun khâuhai chu a hung lên tah a."
"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.","Khâuhai chu Aigupta ram po po chunga chun an hung a, Aigupta ram sûng po poa chun an um khup el tah a; a râpthlâk bêk a, anni hma hin anni ang hrim hin khau an la um ngai nawh a, anni hnunga khawm um ngai ta bawk nawng an tih."
"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.","A ram pumpui chu an dâp khup el sih a, ram chu ân thim khup el bawk a; rama hna hring tinrêng le, thing rahai, riel ihlahai chu an fâk ta ngei a; Aigupta ram pumpuia chun loa thlaihna, thing le thil a hring hrim a um ta dêr nawh a."
"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.","Chun Pharao chun Mosie le Aron chu inhmawtakin a ko a, “Nang le in Pathien LALPA chunga chun thil ka suksuol tah a nih."
"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only.","Tuhin ka ngên che hi, ka suol hi vawikhat bak mi ngaidam nâwk phawt la, hi thina hi keimaa in- thawka a lâkhmang theina dingin LALPA chu mi hnipêk rawh,” a tih a."
"And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.","Pharao kuoma inthawk chu a fe suok a, LALPA chu a hni tah a."
"And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.","LALPA chun khâuhai po po chu lêna, Tuipui Sena khal lût vawngtu, thlang tieng thli hrâttak el chu ân hrângtir tah a, Aigupta ram po poa chun khâu pakhat khawm a um ta nawh a."
"But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Pharao lungril chu a sukngar a, Israel thlahai chu ân fetir chuong nawh."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Aigupta ram chunga inthimna, in- maia inmaina khawp hielin inthimna a hung um theina dingin i bân phar rawh,” a tih a."

"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither.","Kan ran ruolhai khawm keini leh an fe ve ding a nih, ran tê pakhat khawm mâksan an ni ding a ni nawh a; kan Pathien LALPA rawng kan bâwlna dingin kan ṭhuoi ve ngei ding a nih; a hmun kan tlung hmakhat chu ieng hmangin am LALPA rawng chu kan bâwl ding a nih ti kan hriet si nawh a,” a tih a."
"But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharao lungril chu LALPAIN a sukngar a, anni chu ân fetir chuong nawh a."
"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.","Pharao chun a kuomah, “Ka kuoma inthawkin fe hmang la, ka hmêl hrim hrim hung hmu nâwk ta lo dingin fîmkhur rawh, ka hmêl i hmu nâwk ni ni chun i thi ngei ding a ni sih a,” a tih a."
"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.","Mosie chun, “I ti ṭha ngawt el ie, i hmêl hmu nâwk hrim hrim ta naw ning,” a tih a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Pharao le Aigupta chungah hri pakhat la hung intlungtir nâwk ka tih, chu hnunga chun hitaka inthawk hin infetir a ti cheu.

"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.","Mipuihai hrieta chun hril la, pasal tin le nuhmei tinin, rângkachak le tangkaruo incheinahai an tuol- bâwmhaia inthawkin haw seng raw hai se,” a tih a."
"And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out.

"And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.","Zânril lai takah LALPA chun Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po, Pharao nau lutîr a lalṭhungphaa ṭhunga inthawka sal lung ina intâng nau lutîr chen le, ran ruol tê hmasatakhai chen chun a hung sukhlum ta vawng a."

"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:","Pharaoin mipui chu ân suoktir phing chun, Pathienin, “An fenaa hin indona an va hmu pha mipui chu insîr an ta, Aiguptaa chun kîr nâwk rawi an tih,” a ti leiin a lam chu hnai sien khawm Philistin mihai ram fe thlengna lam tieng chun Pathienin anni chu a ṭhuoi nawh a."

"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah.

"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?","Mipui chu an tlân suok tah ti Aigupta lal chu hrila a um chun, mipui chungthua Pharao le a siehlawhai lungril chu ân let ta thut a, “Hi thil ei thaw hi ieng am a nih a, Israel mihai ei rawng an bâwlnaa inthawk ei insuoktir el hi?” an tih a."
"And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:","Pharao chun a sakawr tawlai- lîrhai chu a siemrêl a, a mihai chu a ṭhuoi a,"

"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.","Pharao chu a hung hnai chun Israel thlahai chun an hang en a, an hnunga Aigupta mihai hung ṭhuop ṭhuop chu an hang hmuh a, nasa- takin an ṭih a, Israel thlahai chun LALPA chu an ko tah a."
"And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?","Mosie kuomah, “Aiguptaah thlânhai a um naw leiin a ni maw thlalêra thi dinga i mi ṭhuoi suok hi?

"Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?

"And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.","Mosie chun mipui kuoma chun, “Ngîr ṭawk ṭawk unla, ṭi naw ro, LALPA sandamna, in ta dinga vawisûn a thaw ding chu en el ro; vawisûna Aigupta mi in hmuhai hi kumkhuoin in hmu nâwk ta naw ding a ni sih a."
"Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.","LALPA chun in ta dingin do a ta, nangni ruok chu in um ṭawk ṭawk ding a nih,” a tih a."

"And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:","Chun, LALPA vântirko Israel- hai bûk hmaha fe chu ân tâwl a, an hnungah a fe tah a: chun, sûm ngîr chu an hmaha inthawkin ân tâwl a, an hnungah a ngîr a:"

"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.","Chun, Mosiein tuipui chunga chun a kut a phar a, chun LALPAIN sak thli hrâttak zânkhawvâra hrâng- in tuipui chu ân luong kîrtir a, tuipui chu ram ṭâwlah a siem a, tuihai chu an inṭhe tah a."

"And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians.","An sakawr tawlailîr kekuolhai chu a sukthlawngpêk a, intaktakin an khal tah a; chuongchun, Aigupta mihai chun, “Israelhai hmaha in- thawkin tlân el ei tiu, LALPA chun an ta dingin Aigupta mihai chu a dopêk a ni hi,” an tih a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Tuipui chungah i kut kha phar rawh, Aigupta mihai le, an sakawr tawlailîrhai le, an sakawr chung chuong mihai chungah tui chu a hung luongna dingin,” a tih a."
"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.","Mosie chun tuipui chunga chun a kut chu a phar a, zîngkâr a hung ni chun tuipui chu a luong hrât pângngaiin a luong nâwk tah a; Aigupta mihai chu an tlânsieh a, LALPA chun Aigupta mihai chu tuipuia chun a peilût tah a."
"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.","Tui chu a kîr nâwk a, sakawr tawlailîrhai, sakawr chung chuong mihai le, Pharao sipai ruol, an hnunga hung hnawttuhai ngei chu ân khum ta vawng a, pakhat khawm hlain an um ta nawh a."

"And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?","Mosie tarpupa chun mipui kuoma a thilthaw po po chu a hmu chun, “Mipui ta dinga i thaw hi ieng thil am a na?

"And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:","Mosie chun a tarpupa kuomah, “Mipui chu Pathien ti zâwng indawn dinga ka kuoma an hung leiin a nih."
"when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.","Thubuoi an nei pha ka kuomah an hung a; chun, a vênghai le mi dang kâra thu chu ka rêl a, Pathien dân ziekhai le a dânhai chu ka lo inhriettir hlak a nih,” a tih a."
"And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.","Mosie tarpupa chun a kuomah, “Hi thil i thaw hi a ṭha naw ie."
"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.",Nang le i kuoma mipui umhai hi lân sukchâu ngei ngei in tih; i ta dingin hi thil hi a rik talaw sih a; nanga khât bak chun i thaw thei nawh annawm.
"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:","Tuhin, ka thu hi lo ngâi ta, thurawn hang pêng ka ti che: Pathien chu i kuomah um sienla, Pathien hmaah nang chu mipui aiawtu ni la; nangin Pathien hmaah thubuoi chu intlun pei bawk la:"
"and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.","chun, dân ziekhai le dânhai chu anni inchûktir i ta, an sin thaw dinghai le, kawng an hraw ding chu anni kâwkhmu bawk i ta."
"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:","Chunawa khawm mipui laia inthawk mi thei thei, Pathien ṭi mi, mi indikhai, hlêpna felnaw theida mihai thlang suok la, anni chu sâng khat chunga rorêltu, za khat chunga rorêltu, sâwmnga chunga rorêltu, sâwm chunga rorêltuhai ni dingin sie rawh."
"and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.","Ieng lai khawmin anni chu mipui ro chu inrêltir la, thubuoi lien takhai bak hung intlun an ta, thubuoi chînhai chu annîn lo rêl el an ta; chuongchun, i ta dingin awl lem a ta, i rikphur chu an phurpui ding che annawm."
"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.","Pathienin hieng angtaka thu a pêk cheha, hi thil hi i thaw chun, nang khawmin pei sâwt i ta, mipui po po khawm hi an hmun sengah thlamuongtakin fêng an tih,” a tih a."
"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.","Mosie chun a tarpupa thu chu a ngai a, a hril po po chu a thaw tah a."
"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.","Mosie chun Israel mihai laia inthawkin mi thei deu deu a thlang suok a, anni chu mipui luhai ni dingin, sânghai, zahai, sâwmngahai le sâwmhai chunga rorêltuhaiah a sie tah a."
"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.","Anni chun ieng huna khawm mipui ro chu an rêlpêk a, thubuoi intakhai chu Mosie kuomah an hung intlun a, thubuoi chînhai ruok chu annîn an lo rêl tah a."
And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.,"Chun, Mosie chun a tarpupa chu ân fetir a; a umna ram tieng chun a fe tah a."
"In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.","Aigupta rama inthawka Israel thlahai an fe suok chena inthawka thla thumna, chu ni chun Sinai thlalêr chu an hung tlung tah a."
"And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.","Rephidim an mâksan a, Sinai thlalêr an hung tlung chun thlalêra chun puon in an zar a; chutaka chun Israelhai chun tlâng hmaa chun bûk an khuor a."
"And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:","Mosie chu Pathien kuomah a hang feh a, chun, tlânga inthawkin LALPA chun ama a hung ko a, “Jakob sûnghai lai chun hieng hin hril la, Israel thlahai chu hril rawh;"

"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:","Chuleiin, tuhin, ka thu in awi tak tak a, ka thuthlung in kawl tak tak ding chun, hnuoi hi ka ta a ni sih a, hnam dang po po lai chun ka ta dingin ro bîk nîng in tih."
"and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.","Chun, ka ta dingin thiempuhai ram le hnam inthieng ni bawk in tih. Hieng thuhai hi a nih Israel thlahai kuoma i hril ding chu,” a tih a."
"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.","Chun, Mosie chu a hung a, Israel upahai chu ân kotir a, hieng thuhai po po LALPAIN a kuoma thu a pêkhai chu an hmaah a târlang tah a."
"And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.","Chun, mipui po po chun a ruolin an dawn a, “LALPAIN a hril po pohai chu thâwng kan tih,” an tih a. Mosie chun mipui thuhai chu LALPA kuoma chun ân tlun tah a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Ngai ta, i kuoma thu ka hril lai an hriet theina ding le, kumkhuoha an ring zing theina ding chein, sûm sâmup lai i kuomah hung ka tih,” a tih a. Mosie chun mipui thuhai chu LALPA chu a hril a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Mipui kuoma chun fe la, vawisûn le zîngah sukthieng rawh, an silfênhai chu sâwp hai sienla;"
and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.,"ni thum ni chun inzo hieuin um raw hai se, chu ni thum ni chun Sinai tlâng chungah mipui po po mithmuah LALPA chu a hung ṭum ding a ni sih a."
"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:","Chun, a vêlin ramrihai khang- pêk i ta, Tlâng hang kai lo dingin le a sîr vêl tâwk lo dingin invêng ṭha ro; tukhawm tlâng tâwk taphawt chu sukhlum nîng a tih;"
"no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.","ama chu kut hrimin tâwk naw nih a, dêng hlum, annawleh, kâp hlum nîng a tih; sa khawm ni sien, mihriem khawm ni sien hring naw hrim hrim a tih: tawtawrâwt sâwttak ân ri pha, tlânga chun hung lâwn an tih,” a tih a."
"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.","Mosie chu tlânga inthawk chun mipui kuomah a fe thlah a, mipui chu a sukthieng a, an silfênhai chu an sâwp tah a."
"And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.","Chun, mipui kuoma chun, “Ni thum nia chun inzosa hieuin um unla, nuhmei khawm pâwl dêr naw ro,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.","Ni thum ni chun zîngkâr a la ni laiin, vâninrûmhai, ṭêktlahai, tlâng chunga sûm sâmup le, tawtawrâwt ri inringtak el chu a um tah a; bûka mipui um po po chu an inthin tah a."
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.,"Mosie chun mipui chu Pathien tuok dingin bûka inthawk chun a hung ṭhuoi suok a, tlâng ṭhuta chun an ngîr tah a."
"And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.","LALPA chu meichawka a hung ṭum leiin, Sinai tlâng po po chu a khu ta vawng el a; chu khu chu rawtuina meikhu angin ân tung ta lui el a: tlâng chu nasatakin ân hnîng bawk a."
"And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.","Tawtawrâwt ri chu a hung inring deu deu chun Mosie chun a hang biek a, Pathien râwlriin a hung dawn tah a."
"And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.","LALPA chu Sinai tlâng chung- ah, tlâng sîpa chun a hung ṭum a: chun, Mosie chu tlânga chun a zuk ko a, Mosie chu a hang fe tah a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Fe thla la, mipui chu khap rawh, chuong naw chun hung en dingin LALPA kuom hung nêr thleng hlau an ta, mi tamtak bohmang rawi an tih."
"And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.","Chun, thiempuhai LALPA hnaia hunghai khawm chu insukthieng raw hai se; chuong naw chun an chungah LALPA lungninaw rawi a tih,” a tih a."
"And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.","Mosie chun LALPA kuomah, “Mipui chu Sinai tlâng hung kai thei naw ni hai, nangin, ‘Tlâng vêla chun ramrihai khang unla, sukthieng ro’, tiha i mi phût tlat leiin,” a tih a."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.","LALPA chun a kuomah, “Fe rawh, nang zu fe thla la, Aron ṭhuoiin hung i ta, nisienlakhawm, thiempu- hai le mipui chu LALPA kuoma hung dingin hung innêr thlengtir naw rawh, chuong naw chun an chungah LALPA lungninaw rawi a tih,” a tih a."
"So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu mipui kuoma chun a fe thlah a, anni a hril tah a."
"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.","Chun Levi sûnghai laia mi pakhat chu a feh a, Levi naunu nuhmeiin a nei tah a."
"And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.","Nuhmei chu ân rai a, naupasal a hung nei a; naupang hmêl ṭhatak a nih ti a hmuin thla thum a thup- hmang a."
"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.","Chun, ama chu a thuphmang zing thei naw phingleh phairuong lawng a lâk a, fâr hnai le lawng hnaiin a zût a; chu sûnga chun nau- pang chu a sieh a, vadung sîra phairuonghai lai chun a sie tah a."
"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.",Ama chu iengtin am a um pei ti hre dingin a farnu chu hla fea hin a ngir a.
"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.","Chun Pharao naunu chu va- dunga insil dingin a hung thlah a; a nunghâkhai chu vadung pang hrûla chun an fe vêl a; phairuong- hai laia lawng chu a hmu tah a, nunghâk pakhat chu va la dingin a tir a."
"And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.","A hang hawng chun nautê chu a hmuh a: chun, ngai ta, nautê chu a ṭap tah a. Ama chu a lunginsiet a, “Hi hi Hebrai nauhai laia pakhat chu a ni ngei el,” a tih a."
"Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?","Chun a farnu chun Pharao naunu kuomah, “Fêng ka ta, Hebrai nuhmei naudawntu, hi nautê dawnpêktu ding che hi ka va kopêk ding che am a nih?” a tih a."
"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother.","Pharao naunu chun a kuomah, “Va fe rawh,” a tih a. Chun nunghâk chu a feh a, naupang nu ngei chu a va ko tah a."
"And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.","Chun, Pharao naunu chun a kuomah, “Hi naupang hi la la; ka ta dingin dawn rawh; chun, i hlaw tâwk pêng ka ti che,” a tih a."
"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.","Chun, nuhmei chun naupang chu a lâk a, a dawn tah a.

"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.","Mosie chu a hung puitling a, ni khat chu a unauhai kuomah a fe tah a; an rikphurhai chu a hmuh a: chun, a unauhai laia mi pakhat, Hebrai mi, Aigupta miin a vuok a hmuh a."
"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.","Chun, a ngha vêl a ngha vêl a, mi tukhawm an um nawh ti a hmu phingin Aigupta mi chu a vuok hlum a, phaiphinah a thuphmang tah a."
"And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?","A ni hninaa a va fe suok nâwk chun, ngai ta, Hebrai mi pahni an lo insuol a; ama chun a thil suksuoltu lem kuoma chun, “Iengdinga i unau i vuok am a na?” a tih a."
"And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Kan chungah lal le rorêltuin tuin am a siem cheh a? Aigupta mi i that ang khan kei khawm hi mi that i tum a ni maw?” a tih a. Chun, Mosie chu a ṭi tah a, “Hi thil hi hriet suokin a um chie tah a ni hi,” a tih a."
"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.","Pharao chun chu thil chu a hriet phingleh, Mosie chu sukhlum dingin a zawng tah a. Nisienlakhawm, Mosie chu Pharao hmaa inthawk a tlân hmang a, Midian ramah a um ta zing a; chun, tuisunsuo sîrah a ṭhung tah a."
"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.","Midian mihai thiempu chun naunuhmei pasari a nei a; anni chu an hung a, tui an chawi a, an pa berâm ruol chu tui pe dingin tuibêlhai chu an thâl sip a."
"And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.","Chun, berâmpuhai chu an hung a, anni chu an hnawt hmang tah a; nisienlakhawm, Mosie chu a ngîr a, anni a ṭhangpui a, an berâm ruol chu tui ân dâwntir tah a."
"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?","An pa Reuel kuomah an hung chun, “Iengtizie am a na vawisûn chu in va hung inhma de?” a lo tih a."
"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.","Anni chun, “Aigupta mi pakhat- in berâmpuhai kuta inthawk a mi sansuok tâwl a nih, chu bak khawm chu ni loin tui a mi chawipêk a, kan berâm ruol tui ân dâwntir bawk a,” an tih a."
"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.","Ama chun a naunuhai kuomah, “Anleh ama chu khâwlai am a um a? chu mipa chu iengdinga in hung mâksan am? Bei fa dingin ama chu hung ko ro,” a tih a."
And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.,"Chun, Mosie chu chu mipa kuoma um ding chun ân sukthlûk tah a; ama chun a naunu Zippora chu Mosie a pêk a."
"And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.","Zippora chun naupasal a nei a. Mosie chun, “Hrietlo rama inzin ka ni tah a,” a tih a, a hmingah Gersom a sak tah a."
"And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.","Chuong ni tamtak sûng chun Aigupta lal chu a thi tah a.

"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.","Pathienin an inrûm chu a hriet a, Abraham, Isak le Jakob kuoma a thuthlung chu Pathienin a hriet zing a."
"And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge of them.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu Pathien chun a hmuh a, anni chu a hriet zing bawk a."
"And God spake all these words, saying,","Pathienin hieng thuhai po po hi a hril a,"

"And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.","Chun, an kuomah, “Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Mi tinin a ngûnhnâm chu a mal chungah sie sienla, riebûk po poah kawtkhâr tinah fe vêl sienla, mi tinin a unaupa, mi tinin a ruolpa khawm, mi tinin a tuolbâwm khawm that raw se,’ a tih,” a tih a."

"And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.","Mosie chun, “Vawisûn hin in chunga malsâwmna a pêk theina ding cheuin, mi tin chu mâni naupa amanih, mâni unaupa amanih chenin LALPA rawngbâwl dingin in inhlân ta hi,” a tih a."

"And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.","Chuongchun, Aron isiem bâwngte an siem lei chun LALPAIN mipui chu a hrem tah a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Suok unla, hitaka inthawkin nang le Aigupta rama inthawka mipui i ṭhuoi suokhai chu, Abraham, Isak le Jakob kuoma, ‘I thlahai kuomah pêng ka tih,’ tiha ka tiem tah ram tieng chun fe ro."

"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.","Mipuiin hi thuthang ṭhanaw hi an hriet chun an sûn a, tukhawmin an incheina chu an inbel ta nawh a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Israel thlahai kuomah hril rawh, ‘Mi kâwmâwtak in nih a, mitkhapkâr bak khawm nangni laia ka fe ve chun ka sukbohmang ding cheu a nih a; chuleiin, in incheinahai chu hlîp ro, iengtin am ka thaw ding cheu a nih ti ka hriet theina dingin,’ tiin,” a tih a."
And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chun Horeb tlânga inthawk chu an in- cheinahai chu an hlîp ta vawng a."
"Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting.

"And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.","Mosie chun anni a biek zo chun, hmai inkhumnain a hmai ân khum a."
"But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.","Amiruokchu, Mosie chu LALPA kuomah ama be dinga a lût po leh a hmai inkhumna chu, a hung suok nâwk hmakhat a lâkthlâk zing a: chun, a hung suok a, a kuoma thu pêka um chu Israel thlahai kuoma chun a hril a;"

"And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,","Chu ni ma chun mipuihai sinthaw hotuhai le an hotuhai chu Pharao chun thu a pêk a,"
"Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.","“Kha hma ang khan mipuihai chu ṭêklei siem dingin bupâwl pe ngai ta naw unla, fe hai sienla, an bupâwl ding chu annîn inkhâwm lem raw hai se."
"And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.","Chun, kha hmaa ṭêklei an siem zât tho kha siem dingin phût unla, ieng kawng khawmin suktlâwm naw ro: an tha a bo sih a; chuleiin annâwm, ‘Mîn fetir la, kan Pathien kuomah mîn thâwitir rawh,’ tiha an khêk hi."

"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.","Chun, mipuihai sinthaw hotu- hai le an hotuhai chu an fe suok a, mipuihai kuoma chun, “Pharao chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Bupâwl chu pe naw ning cheu ah."

So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.,"Chuongchun, mipuihai chu Aigupta ram sûng po poa chun bupâwl aiah bu kûng la khâwm ding chun an indar ta sup sup a."

"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.","I siehlawhai hi bupâwl pêk kan ni nawh a, kan kuomah, ‘Ṭêklei siem ro,’ an ti sih a!

"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.","Tuhin fe unla, sin thaw el ro; bupâwl chu pêk ni hliek naw ti niu, ṭêklei ruok chu siem ding zât pângngai chu in pêk suok ngei ding a nih,” a tih a."

"Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuom- ah, “Pharao kuomah fe la, ‘LALPA, Hebraihai Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin ka mihai infetir rawh."
"For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,","Anni chu infetir i phal nawha, i khuokhir zing chun,"
"behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: there shall be a very grievous murrain.","ngai rawh, loa i ran ruol umhai, sakawrhai, sabengtunghai, sa- nghâwngseihai, bâwng ruolhai le, berâm ruolhai chungah LALPA kut chu hri râpthlâktak leh tlâng a tih."
And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.,"Chun, LALPA chun, Aigupta mihai le Israelhai ran ruolhai thlier a ta, Israel thlahai ta taphawt chu iengkhawm thi naw tawp an tih, a tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a tih a."
"And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.","LALPA chun hun bîk a ruot a, “Hi thil hi, hi rama hin zîngah LALPAIN thawng a tih,” a tih a."
And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.,"A zînga chun chu thil chu LALPA chun a thaw tah a. Aigupta mihai ran ruol po po chu an thi vawng a, Israel thlahai ran ruol ruok chu pakhat khawm an thi nawh a."
"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.","Pharao chun mi a tir a, Israel thlahai ran ruol chu pakhat khawm an thi dêr nawh ti a hriet a. Nisienlakhawm, Pharao lungril chu a ngar a, mihai chu ân fetir chuong nawh."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron kuoma chun, “Thuka vut kut sipin chawi unla, Pharao mithmu ngeiah Mosiein vân tieng vawr raw se."
"And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.","Chun, Aigupta ram chung po poah pilvut indi takah inchang a ta, Aigupta ram sûng po povah mihriem le ran chungah khuoihli invûngin inchang a tih,” a tih a."
"And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.","Chun, thuka vut chu an lâk a, Pharao hmaa chun an ngir a; Mosie chun vân tieng chun a vawr tah a, chuongchun, mihriem le ran chunga chun khuoihli invûngah ân chang tah a."
"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.","Chun, khuoihlihai lei chun aisânthiemhai chu Mosie hmaa chun an ngîr thei ta nawh a; chu khuoihli chu Aigupta mihai po po le aisân- thiemhai chunga khawm a um seng sih a."
"And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.","Chun, LALPAIN Pharao lungril chu a sukngar a, LALPAIN Mosie kuoma a hril ta angin an thu hril chu a ngai chuong nawh a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Zîngkâr inhmatakin tho la, Pharao hmaah ngîr la, a kuomah, ‘Hebraihai Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin ka mihai infetir rawh."
"For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.","Hnuoi chung po poah keima ang tukhawm an um nawh ti i hriet theina dingin, tuta ṭum hin chu, i mihai le i siehlawhai le nangma chunga ngei ka hri po po ka hung tir ding a ni sih a."
"For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:","Tuhin ka kut inlet ka ta, i mihai le nang ngei chu hripuiin hrem ka ti cheu a, hnuoia inthawka sâtthlâk ni tâng i tih:"
"but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.","nisienlakhawm, hi thilthaw kawng ngeihaia hin ka thilthawthei- nahai chu nangmaa inentir a ni theina ding le khawvêl po poa ka hming chu phuongdar a ni theina dingin ka la dawmngir zing che a ni hi."
"As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?","Ka mihai chunga hin nang le nang inchawimawiin, anni chu i lân fetir naw rawp ding a ni maw?"
"Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.","Ngai rawh, zîngah tu pha ngei hin riel nasa râpthlâk insûrtir ka ta; chuong ang hrim hrim chu Aigup- taah, hi ram um hlima inthawk tu chen hin a la um ngai dêr nawh."
"Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.","Chuleiin, tuhin mi tir la, i ran ruol le loa i thil nei po po chu inhulah hung la lût vak raw hai se; mi tin le ran loa um taphawthai, ina hung lâk lût nawhai chungah riel chu a hung sûr ding a ni sih a, an thi vawng ding a nih, a tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a tih a."
He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:,Pharao siehlawhai laia LALPA thu ṭitu chun a siehlawhai le a ran ruol chu inahai ân tlân lûttir a;
and he that regarded not the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.,LALPA thu ngaisaknawtu ruok chun a siehlawhai le ran ruol chu loah ân umtir a.
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Aigupta ram sûng po poa, mihriem le ran le loa thlai tinrêng chungah, Aigupta ram po poah riel nasatak a hung sûr theina dingin, vân tieng i kut phar rawh,” a tih a."
"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.","Chun, Mosie chun a hmawl chu vân tieng ân let a; chuongchun, LALPA chun vâninrûm le riel chu a hung tir tah a, hnuoia chun mei dâm a zuk tlah a, LALPA chun Aigupta ram chunga chun riel ân sûrtir tah a."
"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.","Chuongchun, riel, ṭêktla le riel inpawl, râpthlâktak el, Aigupta ram po poah, hnam a hung ni chena inthawka la hmu ngai dêr lo chu a hung tlung tah a."
"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.","Aigupta ram po poa, loa thil um taphawt chu mihriem le ran khawm a dêng hlum ta vawng a; riel chun loa thlaihna tinrêng chu a dêng hlumin, rama thinghai khawm chu a dêng thliek bawk a."
"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.",Israel thlahai umna Gosen rama bak chun riel chu a tla ve nawh a.
"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.","Chun, Pharao chun mi a tir a, Aron le Mosie chu ân kotir a, an kuomah, “Tuta ṭum chu ka lo suol takzet a nih, ka mihai le kei chu kan khawhlo a, LALPA ruok chu a fel a nih."
"Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.","Hun ta raw se, riel le vâninrûm ri nasatakhai hi a bona dingin LALPA chu hni la, chuongchun, infetir ka ti cheu, um ta hrim hrim naw ti niu,” a tih a."
"And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah’s.","Mosie chun a kuomah, “Khaw- pui hi ka suoksan phingleh, LALPA tieng ka kut phar ka ta, hnuoi hi LALPA ta a nih ti i hriet theina dingin, vâninrûmhai chu mâng a ta; riel hrim khawm um nâwk ta dêr naw nih."
"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.","Nisienlakhawm, nang le i sie- hlawhai chun, LALPA Pathien chu la ṭi chuong naw ti niu ti ka hriet a nih,” a tih a."
"And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.","Ziza le buṭei chu dêng hlumin an um a, buṭei chu a vui tahin ziza khawm chu a pâr lai tak a ni sih a."
But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.,"Bupui le mîm ruok chu dêng siet an ni ve nawh a, an puitling inhnu leiin."
"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.","Mosie chu Pharao kuoma inthawka khawpui puoha a suok chun, LALPA kuom tieng a kut chu a phar tah a; chun, vâninrûmhai le riel chu a ma tah a, hnuoi chunga chun ruo khawm a sûr ta nawh a."
"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.","Pharao chun ruo le riel le vâninrûmhai chu a ma tah ti a hmu chun, a la suksuol ta rawp a, ama le a siehlawhai khawm chun an lungril chu an la sukngar ta rawp a."
"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.","Pharao lungril chu sukngarin a um a, Mosie baua LALPAIN a lo hril ta angin, ama chun Israel thlahai chu ân fetir nuom nawh a."
