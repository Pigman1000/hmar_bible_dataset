The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.,Pethuel naupa Joel kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung chu.
"Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?","Tarsiehai, hi hi hre unla, hi rama um po pohai, na lo sit ro.Hi in hun lai le in puhai hun laia khawm a um ta hlak am a nih?"
"Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.","Chu chu in nauhai hril unla, in nauhai chun an nauhai hril sienla, an nau nâwksâwnghai chun suon dang hril pei raw hai se."
That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.,"Thilngein a fâk mahla po chu khauṭhikṭhiin a fâk a, khâuṭhikṭhiin a fâk mahla po chu thingngein a fâk a; thingngein a fâk mahla po chu tuktulungin a fâk zo a."
"Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.","Inruihai, har unla, ṭap ro; uoin dâwn po pohai, a uoin thlum lei chun khêk rak rak unla, in baua inthawka lâk hmang a ni ta sih a."
"For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.","Hnam hrâttak, tiem sênglo ka rama inthawkin a hung suok ta sih a, a ha chu sakeibaknei ha ang a na, sakeibaknei lientak hapui ang a nei bawk a."
"He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.","Ka grêp hrui a suksiet a, ka theichang kûng hâwng a khek a, a khek fai vawng a, a peihâwn a; a kâuhai chu a fil vâr vawng a."
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.,"Nunghâkin saiip puon bil a, a ṭhat- lai pasal a sûn angin ṭap rak rak ro."
"The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah’s ministers, mourn.","Beiphit inhlân dâm, dâwn ding inhlân dâm chu LALPA ina inthawka sukbo a na, thiempu LALPA rawng- bâwltuhai chu an lungngai a."
"The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.","Lo chu suksiet a na, ram chu a lungngai a, bu chu suksiet a na, uoin thar chu a kang a, hriek khawm chu a chau a."
"Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.","Aw, nangni lo neituhai, inzak unla, nangni grêp hrui enkawltuhai, bupui le buṭei leiin khêk rak rak ro; loa bu sîk ding chu a bohmang ta sih a."
"The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.","Grêp hrui chu a vuoi a, thei- chang kûng chu a châu a, theibufai kûng dâm, intûm dâm le apple thei kûng dâm, loa thing po pohai khawm chu a ṭuoi tah a; mihriem nauhai laia lâwmna chu a vuoi hmang ta sih a."
"Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.","Nangni thiempuhai, saiip puon dierkei unla, ṭap ro; nangni mâichâm rawngbâwltuhai, khêk rak rak ro; nangni ka Pathien rawngbâwltuhai, hung unla, saiip puon silin zânkhaw- vârin zâl ro: in Pathien ina inthawk chun beiphit inhlân le dâwn ding inhlân chu khap a ni sih a."
"Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men and all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.","Bu nghei hun inser thieng unla, inkhâwmpui ursûn siem unla, LAL- PA in Pathien ina chun tarsiehai le hi rama chênghai po po chu ṭhuoi khâwm unla, LALPA chu ko ro."
"Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.","Chu ni chu a chung a rik de! LALPA ni chu a hnai ta sih a, Iengkim- thawtheia inthawka bohmangna ang hung tlung a tih."
"Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?","Ei mithmua fâk ding sukbo a ni naw am a nih? Anih, ei Pathien ina inthawka hlimna le lâwmna leh?"
"The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.","Chihai chu hnuoitlang hnuoia chun a hmawn a; zênghai chu a sieh a, bu inhai chu ṭhiekin a um a, a bu chu a vuoi zo ta sih a."
"How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.","Ranhai chu an inrûm nasa de! Bâwng ruolhai chu an lunginzîng a, hlohna hring hmun an nei naw leiin; anih, berâm ruolhai chu an rêm zo tah a."
"O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.","Aw LALPA, ka ko che hi; mei chun thlalêr ram hlohna hmun chu a kâng fai tah a, meichawk chun ram thing po po chu a kâng fai ta sih a."
"Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.","Anih, ramsahai chu nanga ngaiin an inthuok huom huom a, va- dungtêhai chu a kang intan a, mei chun thlalêr hmun hlohna hmun chu a kâng fai ta sih a."
"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;","Ziona chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, ka tlâng inthienga chun inrâl- ringna sukri ro, hi ram sûnga mi po pohai chu inthin raw se; LALPA ni chu a hung tlung mêk a, a hnai ta sih a;"
"a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.","inthimna le vâninnîmna ni, sûm zîng ni le inthim sâ ni, tlâng chunga vârtle var rên ruon ang; mipui nasa- tak le hrâttak, chuong ang la um ngai lo, chuong hnunga suon tamtak chen khawma um nâwk ta ngailo ding chu."
"A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.","An hmatieng chu meiin a kâng fai a, an hnungtieng meichawkin a hlieu bawk a; an hmaa ram chu Eden huon ang a nih; an hnungtieng chu thlalêr ram ṭâwl a nih, ieng- khawmin chuong chu an pumpel ta nawh."
"The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.",An inlang dân chu sakawr inlang dân ang a nih; sakawr chuong mi angin an tlân a.
"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.","Indona tawlailîr ri angin tlâng chunga chun an kat sup sup a, pâwl kâng chawk dur dur ang le indonaa mipui hrâttak inzosa angin."
At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.,"An hmaa mipuihai chu an thla- phâng a, an hmêlhai chu a hung dâng vawng tah a."
"They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.","Mi hrâttak angin an tlân a, indo mi angin bangah an lâwn a; mâni zâwn sengah an feh a, an intlar dân an sukbuoi nawh."
"Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off their course.","An inhneng bawk nawh a, mâni lampui sengah an feh a, hriemhreihai an nêrthleng a, an fe pêt nawh."
They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.,Khawpui chunga chun an in- châwm a; kul chungah an tlân a; in sûngahai chun an hang lâwn a; inru angin tukverahai an lût a.
"The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.","An hmaa chun hnuoi khawm ân thin a; vânhai ân hnîng a; nisa le thla chu an inthim a, arasihai chun an var an thup a:"
And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?,"LALPA chun a sipai ruolhai hmaa chun râwl ân suoh a, a rie- bûkhai chu a ropui hle sih a; a thu muolsuotu chu a hrât hle sih a. LALPA ni chu a ropuiin a râpthlâk êm êm sih a; tuin am tuor thei a ta?"
"Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:","LALPA chun, “Chuong sa khawmin tuhin in lungril po poin, bu ngheiin, ṭapin, lungngaiin keia tieng hung ngha unla;"
"and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.","in puon ni loin, in lungril thlêr ro,” a tih. LALPA in Pathien tieng chu ngha ro: ama chu lunginsiet theitak le lainatnaa sip, lunginuoi le zainêm- naa sip, thil ṭha naw chu inlêt hlak a nih."
"Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?","LALPA in Pathien kuomah, bei- phit inhlân le dâwn ding inhlânahai khawm chun, kîrin lungril inlêtin, malsâwmna mâksanin um naw ni ti tuin am a hriet a?"
"Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;","Ziona chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, bu nghei hun inserthieng ro; inkhâwmpui ursûntak chu siem ro,"
"gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.","mipui inkhâwm unla, in- khâwmpuihai chu sukthieng unla, tarsiehai, naupanghai, nenê ne laihai kei khâwm unla, moneitu chu a pin- dana inthawkin hung suok sienla, mo khawm a pindan sûngrila inthawk chun hung suok raw se."
"Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?","Thiempu, LALPA rawngbâwl- tuhai chu, tuolpûk le mâichâm inkâra chun ṭap sienla, “Aw LALPA i mihai hla la, i rochanhai hi hrilsieta uma hnamhaiin an chunga ro an rêlpêk dingin pe naw rawh: ‘An Pathien chu khâw lai am a um ta leh,’ tiin an mipuihai lai chun ieng dingin am tîng an ta?” ti raw se."
"Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.","LALPA chun a ram chu a thîk a, a mihai chu a lunginsiet a."
"And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;","LALPA chun a dawn a, a mihai kuomah, “Ngai unla, in kuomah bu dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm hung in- tlun ka ta, chuonghaia chun tlai in ta: hnamhai laia chun hrilsietin inumtir nâwk ta naw ning cheu a:"
"but I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.","amiruokchu, in kuoma in- thawkin hmârtieng sipai ruol chu sawnhmang dai ka ta, ram ṭâwl le râusannaah infetir ka tih, a hmasa pâwl saktieng tuisuorietah, a nu- hnung pâwl thlangtieng tuisuorietah; hung ṭhuoi suok a ta, rimsetakin hung innam a tih, thil nasatak a thaw ta leiin."
"Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.","Aw ram, ṭi naw la, hlimin lâwm rawh, LALPA chun thil ropuitakhai a thaw ta sih a."
"Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.","Ranhai, ṭi naw ro, thlalêr hlobet hmun a hung inder a; thing chu a hung rah a, theichang kûng le grêp- hruihai chu a hung inno sih a."
"Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.","Nangni Zion nauhai, lâwm ro, LALPA in Pathiena chun hlim ro; ruo hmasa chu inkhi chiein a pêk si cheu a, in ta dingin ruo ân sûrtir a, thla khatnaa ruo hmasa le ruo nuhnung chu."
"And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.","Ṭuonghai chu buin hung sip a ta, uoin le hriek chu bêlahai chun sip liem a ta."
"And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.","Nangni laia ka sipai ruol tamtak ka itir, tawktawngang dâm, khâuṭhikṭhi dâm, thingnge dâm, tuktulung dâmin an fâk zo kumhai kha thung nâwk ka ti cheu."
"And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.","Tamtak nei in ta, tlai in tih, maktaka ngaituo hlaktu cheu LALPA in Pathien hming chu inpâk in ta, ka mihai chu muolpho hrim hrim naw ni hai."
"And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.","Chun, Israelhai lai hin ka um ti le, LALPA in Pathien ka na, tu dang khawm an um nawh ti hrieng in tih; ka mihai chu muolpho nâwk ta naw ni hai."
"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:","“Chu hnunga chun mi po po chungah ka thlarau buok ka ta; chuongchun, in naupasalhaiin, in naunuhmeihaiin ka thu hril an ta, in tarhaiin mangah mang an ta, in tlangvâlhaiin inlârnahai hmûng an ta:"
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.,chuong niahai chun suokpahai le suoknuhai chunga khawm ka thlarau buok ka tih.
"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.","Vâna le hnuoiahai thilmak- hai inhmutir ka ta, thisen dâm, meikhu dâm, meikhu ngîr dâm leh."
"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.","Nisa inthimin inchang a ta, thla chu thisenah inchang a ta, LALPA ni ropuitak le râpthlâktak chu a hung tlung hma chun."
"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.","Chun, hieng ang hi nîng a ta, tukhawm LALPA hming lam taphawt chu sanhim nîng an tih; LALPAIN a hril ang khan a tlânsuokhai chu Zion tlânga le Jerusalem khuoah an um âwm sih a, chu hai lai chun LALPAIN a kohai chu ṭhang an tih.”"
"For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,","“Ngai ta u, chuong niahai le chuong pha chun, Juda le Jerusa- lem sala an um chu ka ṭhuoikîr nâwk pha chun,"
"I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,","hnam po po kei khâwm ka ta, anni chu Jehosaphat kâwnah hung ṭhuoi thlâng ka ta, ka ram an sem dar a, hnamhai laia an sukdar, ka mihai le ka rochan Israelhai ta ding chun anni chu chutaka chun khing ka tih."
"and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.","Ka mihai ta dingin ai an sân a, nawchizawr man dingin pasal naupang an pêk a, uoin an dâwn theina dingin, a man dingin nuhmei naupang an zawr a."
"Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head.","Anih, aw Tura le Sidon le Philistin ram po pohai, ka ta dingin ieng am in nih a? In mi thung ding am a nih? In mi thung chun, hrâttakin, inhmawtakin in mi thungna chu in lu chung ngeiah thung vêng ka ti cheu."
"Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,","Ka tangkaruo le ka rângkachak in lâk a, ka thil ṭhatak, ditumtak- hai, in biekin sûngahai in chawi lût vei a;"
"and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border;",Juda nauhai le Jerusalem nau- hai khawm an ramria inthawka hlataka in sawn hmang theina dingin Grik naupasalhai kuomah in zawr el sih a;
"behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head;","ngai ta u, in zawrna hmuna inthawk khan chawkthoin insuoktir ka ta, in thungna chu in lu chung ngeiah thung vêng ka tih."
"and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken it.","In naupasalhai, in naunuhmei- hai chu Juda nauhai kutah zawr ka tih; anni chun hlatakah Seba mihai kuomah anni chu zawr an ta, LALPA chun a ti tah a nih,” tiin."
"Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.","“Hi hi hnamhai lai chun hril dar unla, indona buotsai unla, mi hrât- takhai chawktho unla, indo mi po pohai hung hnai hai sienla, hung raw hai se."
"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.","In hnuoi inletna hmawrzumhai kâwlhnâmah sut unla, in thei kûng âtbawngna chemtêhai chu feiah sut ro; mi hrât naw khawm a, Ka hrât a nih, ti raw se."
"Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.","A vêla hnam po pohai, inhmaw unla, pungkhâwm unla, hung tâwl ro; aw LALPA, chutaka chun i mi hrât- takhai infe thlâktir rawh."
"Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.","Hnamhai chu inchawktho sien- la, Jehosaphat kâwna chun hung tâwl raw hai se, chutaka chun a vêla hnam po po hai chunga rorêl dingin ka ṭhung ding a nih."
"Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.","In kâwite kei dawk unla, bu sîk a hun ta sih a: hung unla, hung sirsâwr ro; grêp sâwrna khur chu a sip a, bêlhai chu a sip liem a; an suolna a nasa sih a."
"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.","Mipuihai, thusukthlûkna kâwna mipui um mur murhai! LALPA ni chu thusukthlûkna kâwna chun a hnai ta sih a."
"The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.","Nisa le thla dâm an inthim a, arasihaiin an varna an thup a."
"And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge unto his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.","“Chun, LALPA chu Zion tlânga inthawkin inrûm dur dur a ta, Jerusalema inthawkin a râwl in- suong a ta; vân le hnuoi inhnîng an ta; nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu a mihai ta dingin inhumhimna nîng a tih, Israel thlahai ta dingin kulbîng nîng a tih."
"So shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.","Chuongchun, LALPA in Pathien ka tlâng inthieng Ziona chêng ka nih ti hrieng in tih; chuongchun, Jerusa- lem khuo chu inthieng a ta, mikhuol tukhawm fethleng nâwk ta dêr naw ni hai."
"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.","“Chu ni chun tlâng insânghai chun uoin thlum infartir an ta, tlânghai chu nênetuiin luong a tih, Juda ram vadungtêhai po po chu tuiin luong a ta; LALPA ina in- thawkin tuikhur hung inchik dawk a tih, Sittim varuom chu hung suk- hnâwng a tih."
"Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.","Juda nauhai chunga nunsetaka thawa, an ramah mi thiem thisen an insuo leiin Aigupta ram chu bo a ta, Edom ram chu thlalêr ram ṭâwl nîng a tih."
"But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.","Juda ram ruok chu kum- khuoin um zing a ta, Jerusalem chu suona inthawka suon dang chenin."
"And I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.","Chun, an thisen ka isâwpfai naw chu sâwpfai ka ta, LALPA chu Ziona chun a chêng zing sih a.”"
