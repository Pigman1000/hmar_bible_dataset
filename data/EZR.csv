"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,","Persia lal Kura inlal kum khatna chun, Jeremia baua LALPA thu- hril chu a hung tlung theina dingin LALPA chun Persia lal Kura lungril chu a chawktho tah a, chuongchun, a ram po poa chun thu inhriettirna a siem a, a zieka ziek khawmin a sie bawk a,"
"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.","“Persia lal Kura chun hieng ang hin a hril, ‘Leihnuoia ram po pohai chu LALPA vâna Pathien chun a mi pêk a; Juda rama Jerusalema chun a ta dinga in bâwl dingin a mi phût bawk a nih."
"Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.","A mi po pohai, nangni laia mi tukhawm kuomah a Pathien chu um raw se! Juda rama Jerusalema chun hang fe sienla, LALPA Israelhai Pathien (ama chu Jerusalema um Pathien chu a nih) in chu hang bâwl raw se."
"And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.","Chun, mi tukhawm ân pêmna hmun khâwlaia khawm mâksan a um chun, ama hmuna mihai chu tangkaruo le, rângkachak le, thuom- hnawhai le, ranhaiin nuomthua pêk bâkah ṭhangpui raw se,’” tiin."
"Then rose up the heads of fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.","Chun, Juda le Benjamin pahnam luhai le thiempuhai le, Levi mihai, Jerusalema um LALPA in bâwl dinga hang fe dinga Pathienin an lungril a chawkthohai taphawt chu an tho tah a."
"And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.","Chun, an vêla mi po pohai chun, inhâwktaka an inhlân po po bâka chun, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, thuomhnawhai dâm, ranhai dâm le thil hlutakhaiin an kuthai chu an sukhrât a."
"Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;","Lal Kura khawm chun LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai, Nebukadnezzarin Jerusalema inthawka a hung lâk a, a pathien ina a siehai chu a hung lâk suok a."
"even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.","Persia lal Kura chun, chuonghai ngei chu sum enkawltu Mithredath kutin a hung lâk suok a, Juda ram lal Sesbazzar kuoma chun a tiempêk tah a."
"And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,","Chun, hi hi chuonghai nizât chu a nih; rângkachak thlêng lien sâwm- thum, tangkaraw thlêng lien sâng khat, chemtê sâwmhni pakuo;"
"thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.","rângkachak no sâwmthum, tangkaraw no a chi dang za li le sâwm khat le bûr le bêl dang hrim hrim sâng khat leh."
"All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.","Rângkachak le tangkaraw bûr le bêl po pohai chu sâng nga le za li an nih. Hienghai po po hi Sesbazzar chun, sal intânghai Babulona in- thawka Jerusalema an hung ṭhuoi ruol chun a hung lâk ve a nih."
"Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.","Ezra chu a ṭawngṭai a, thupha a chawi a, Pathien in tuola bawkkhupa a ṭap a ṭap sûng chun, pasal le nuhmei le naupang mipui nasatak el Israel mihai laia mi chu an hung inkhâwm ta ṭeu el a; mipuihai chu nasatakin an ṭap an ṭap el sih a."
"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.","Elam naupasalhai laia pakhat, Jehiel naupa Sekania chun Ezra chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ei Pathien chunga chun ei bawsiet ta chu a na, hi rama mihai hmêlmak nuhmeihai chu nuhmeia dâm ei nei tah a, ami- ruokchu, hi chungthua hin Israel mi ta ding hin beisei um a la um a nih."
"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.","Chuleiin, tuhin, chuong nuhmei- hai po po chu ma ding le, annia inthawka pieng taphawt chu sie hmang dingin, Lalpa le ei Pathien thupêka inthintuhai rorêl ang peiin, ei Pathien leh thuthlung siem ei tiu; chuongchun, dân ang taka thaw ni raw se."
"Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.","Tho rawh, hi thu hi nanga chungah ân nghat a nih; chun, hi keini khawm nanga kuomah kan ṭhang ve bawk a, insukhuoi la, thaw el rawh,” tiin."
"Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.","Chun, Ezra chu a tho a, thiempu laltakhai, Levi mihai, Israel mi po pohai le chun hi thu ang tak hin inkhâm dingin a tir tah a. Chuong- chun, an inkhâm tah a."
"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.","Chun, Ezra chu Pathien in tuola chu a tho a, Eliasib naupa Jehohanan pindana chun a va fe tah a; chun, chutaka a va fe khawm chun, bei a fâk nawh a, tui khawm a dâwn bawk nawh a; sal intâng suokhai bawsiet- na lei chun nasatakin a lungngai sih a."
"And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;","Chun, Juda ram le Jerusalem vêl po poa chun sal intâng suokhai po po kuomah, Jerusalemah an hung khâwm vawng ding a na;"
"and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.","tukhawm ni thum sûnga hung naw chu mi ṭhahai le upahai rorêl dân angin a thuomhnaw po po chu chân a ta, ama ngei khawm chu sal intâng suokhai laia inthawk pâwlser nîng a tih, tiin thuphuong an siem tah a."
"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days (it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month); and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.","Chuongchun, Juda le Benjamin rama mi po pohai chu ni thum sûngin Jerusalema chun an hung inkhâwm ṭeu el tah a; chu chu thla kuona, ni sâwmhni ni tak a nih: chuongchun, mipuihai chu ruopui nasatak lei le, hi thu lei hin inthin pumin Pathien in tuol hmun âwla chun an ṭhung tâwl tah a."
"And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.","Chun, thiempu Ezra chu a ngîr suok a, an kuomah, “In bawsiet tah a, Israel ram khawhlona chu belsa ding- in hmêlmak nuhmei in nei nâwk nghâl a."
"Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.","Chuleiin, tuhin, in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuoma chun thupha- chawina siem unla, a dit zâwng chu thaw ro: chuongchun, hmêlmak nu- hmeihaia inthawk le hi ram mihaia inthawkin nangni chu insiehre ro,” a ta."
"Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.","Chun, mipui pungkhâwm po pohai chun an dawn a, râwl inring- takin, “Kan chungthu i hril ang tak chun, chuong ang ngei chun kan thaw ding a nih."
"But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.","Amiruokchu, mipui hi tamtak an na, ruo nasatak sûr lai a ni bawk a, tuola hin kan um zing thei nawh a, ni khat ni hni sin el khawm a ni bawk nawh a, hi thil chunga hin nasatakin kan lo bawsiet ta sih a."
"Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.","Kan mi ṭhahai hi mipui aiaw dingin thlang ni hai sienla, hi thil hi sukfel a ni hmakhat, kan chunga Pathien lunginsenna ṭiumtak chu hlîpthlâk a ni hmakhat chun, kan khuohaia hmêlmak nuhmei neituhai chu, khaw tina upahai le rorêltuhai leh hun ruotahai chun hung lem raw hai se,” an ta."
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.,"Asahel naupa Jonathan le Tikva naupa Jahzeia chau chun hi thu hi an kal a, Mesullam le Sabbe- thai Levi mihai chun anni chu an thlawp thung a."
"And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ houses, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.","Chuongchun, sal intâng suok- hai chun chuong ang chun an thaw tah a. Chun, thiempu Ezra chu, an pahnam ang peiin, pahnam upa ṭhenkhathai leh, an rêngin an hming suot sengin an siehran tah a. Chuongchun, thla sâwmna, ni khat ni chun chu thil chu enfie dingin an ṭhung tah a."
And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.,"Chun, thla khatna, ni khat ni chun hmêlmak nuhmei nei mihai po po chu an zo tah a."
"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: namely, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.","Chun, thiempuhai naupasalhai lai ngei khawm chun hmêlmak nuhmei lo neituhai chu hmusuok an hung ni tah a: hming lamin hieng, Jozadak naupa Jesua naupasalhai, an unauhai leh; Maaseia, Eliezer, Jarib le Gedalia hai hi."
"And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.","Anni chun an nuhmeihai chu ma dingin thu an tiem a; chuong- chun, khawhlo an lo ni ta lei chun, an suol ta dingin berâm ruol laia mi berâmchal pakhat an inhlân tah a."

"And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.","Chun, thla sarina a hung tlung a, Israel thlahai chu khuohaia an um phing chun, mipuihai chu in- thuruoltak elin Jerusalema chun an inkhâwm tah a."
"Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.","Chun, Jozadak naupa Jesua le a unau thiempuhai, Sealtiel naupa Zerubbabel le a unauhai le chun an tho a, Pathien mi Mosie dâna ziek angin, chutaka chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânna dingin Israel Pathien mâichâm chu an siem tah a."
"And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.","Chuongchun, mâichâm chu ân ṭhutnaa chun an inṭhut tah a; chuong rama mihai lei chun an chunga chun ṭitna chu a um sih a; chuongchun, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu chutaka chun LALPA kuomah, pum- rawhmang thilinhlânhai ngei chu zîng le zânin an inhlân zie tah a."
"And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;","Chun, bâwkte ruoiṭhe khawm chu an nei a, zieka a um angin, thu- pêk ang peiin, ni tina thaw ding ṭul ang pei chun, ni tinin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an inhlân tah a;"
"and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah.","chu hnunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân châmchi le, thla thara suk- thieng ta po pohai le, mi tinin LALPA kuoma mâni nuomthua inhâwktaka thilinhlânna dâm an nei tah a."
From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.,"thla sarina ni khat nia chun LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai chu an inhlân ṭan a; ami- ruokchu, LALPA biekin lungphûm chu phûm a la ni hri nawh a."
"They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.","Lung sut mihai le themthiemhai kuoma chun sum an pêk a; chun, Persia lal Kuraa inthawka phalna an nei ang peiin, Lebanona inthawka tuisuorieta Joppa chena Sidar thing- hai an hung lâkna dingin, Zidon mihai le Tura mihai kuoma chun bu le dâwn ding le hriek dâm an pêk bawk a."
"Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien ina an hung chin a kum hninaa, thla hninaa chun, Sealtiel naupa Zerub- babel le, Jozadak naupa Jesua le an unau dang thiempuhai le, Levi mihai le, sala intâng suoka Jerusalema hung po pohai chun an ṭan a; Levi mihai chu kum sâwmhnia upa le a chung tieng pohai chu LALPA ina sinthawna chu enkawl dingin an ruot tah a."
"Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.","Chun, Jesua le a naupasalhai le a unauhai le, Kadmiel le a naupasal- hai, Juda naupasalhai chu Pathien ina sinthaw mihai enkawl ding chun an tho tah a. Henadad naupasalhai le an naupahai le an unauhai Levi mihai le chun an tho ve tah a."
"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.","Chun, in bâwltuhai chun LAL- PA biekin lungphûm chu an phûm lai chun thiempuhai chu tawtawrâwt chawiin an thuoma inthuomin an ngîr a, chun, Israel lal David thupêk angin LALPA chu inpâk dingin Asaph naupasal Levi mihai chu dâr- benthekhai leh an ngîr bawk a."
"And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto Jehovah, saying, For he is good, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.","LALPA kuoma lâwmthu hrilin le inpâkin insawntuoin hla an sak a, “Ama chu a ṭha sih a, Israelhai chunga a zângaina chu kumkhuoin a um zing sih a,” tiin. Chun, LALPA in lungphûm chu phûm a ni ta leiin, LALPA an inpâk lei chun mipui chu khêkri nasatakin an khêk a."
"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:","Amiruokchu, thiempuhai, Levi mihai an pahnamhai laia mi tamtak, mi upahai chu in hmasa lo hmutuhai chu, an mithmu ngeia chu in lung- phûm chu phûm a lo ni chun rawl inringtak elin an ṭap tah a, mi danghai ruok chu lâwmin an khêk a;"
"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.","chuongchun, mipuihai chun lâwma khêkri le mipuihai ṭap ri chu an ṭhehran thei naw hiel a; mipuihai chu ri nasatakin an khêk tâwl a, ram hlataka inthawk khawma ân hriet hiel el sih a."
"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;","Juda le Benjamin hai hmêlmahai chun sal intâng suokhai chun Israel Pathien, LALPA ta dingin biekin an bâwl ti an lo hriet tah a;"
"then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ houses, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.","Zerubbabel le pahnama upahai kuoma chun anni chu an hung a, an kuomah, “Nangni hi bâwlpui vêng kan ti cheu, in thaw ang bawkin in Pathien hi a ni sia kan zawng chu; chuongchun, Assuria lal Esar-had- don, hitienga keini mi hung ṭhuoitu huna inthawk ta kha ama kuoma chun kan inthâwi hlak tah a nih,” an tih a."
"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ houses of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.","Nisienlakhawm, Zerubbabel le Jesua le Israel pahnam upa danghai chun an kuomah, “Kan Pathien ta dinga in bâwl dingin keini le hin iengkhawm thaw ding in nei nawh; Persia lal Kurain keini thu a mi pêk angin, Israelhai Pathien, LALPA ta dinga in chu keini khât ngeiin bâwl lem kan tih,” an tih a."
"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,","Chuongchun, chu rama mihai chun Juda mihai kut chu an sukhrât- naw tah a, in bâwl thua chun an sukbuoi a,"
"and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.","an thiltum chu khap dingin an chunga rorêltuhai, Persia lal Kura dam sûng le, Persia lal Daria rorêl chen khan an ruoi tah a."
"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Ahasuera rorêl lai, a rorêl ṭan hlimin Jerusalem le Juda rama umhai chunga hêkna an ziek tah a."
"And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian character, and set forth in the Syrian tongue.","Chun, Artazerzia hun laiin, Bislam hai, Mithredath hai, Tabeel hai le a ruol danghaiin Persia lal Artazerzia kuoma chun lekha an ziek a, chu lekha chu Suria lekhaa ziek, Suria ṭawnga ziek a na."
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:,Rorêltu Rehum le lekhaziektu Simsai chun Jerusalem chungthuah hieng ang hin lal Artazerzia kuoma chun an ziek a;
"then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,","chuongchun, rorêltu Rehum le lekhaziektu Simsai le an ruol dang- hai rorêltuhai, ram awptuhai, ram hotuhai, Persia mihai, Erek mihai, Babulon mihai, Elam mi Susana umhai le,"
"and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth.","hnam dang danghai, milien le ropui Osnapparin a hnawt dawk a, Samari ram khawpuihaia ân umtir- hai le vadung râltienga an umtirhai le chun chu lekha chu an ziek a na."
"This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.","Hieng hi an lekha ziek dân chu a nih; Laltak Artazerzia kuomah: “Va- dungpui râla i siehlawhai leh, chuong ang peiin,"
"Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.","i kuoma inthawka Juda hung- hai kha Jerusalemah kan kuomah an hung a nih ti hi lal chun lo hre raw se; khawpui sie le hel chu an bâwl a, a kulhai chu an zo tah a, a lungphûm- hai chu an siem ṭha mêk a nih."
"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings.","Hi khuo hi hienga an bâwl a, a kulhai an zo chun, leiman dâm, sie amanih, ram man amanih pe naw ni hai a, a tâwpa chun lalhai chu sukse ngei an tih ti hi lal chun lo hre bawk raw se."
"Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;","Tuhin lal in ropui chi chu liek kan na, lal hang sukmuolpho chu kan ta dingin a âwm naw a nih, chuleiin, kan hung thawnin lal chu kan hrilfie a nih;"
"that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.","i pi le puhai thu ziekna lekha- bua chun zawng ni sien la, chuong- chun, chu thu ziekna lekhabua chun hmûng i ta, hi khuo hi khaw hel a na, ram le lalhai ta ding khawma pawitâwk a na, inhma khawma buoina an lo siem tah a; chuong lei chun hi khuo hi suksiet a nih ti hrieng i tih."
"We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.","Hi khuo hi bâwl a hung na, a kulhai chu zo a hung ni ngei ngei chun vadung râla hin chu hieng ang hin chan hrim nei naw ti nih ti lal chu kan hung hrilfie a nih,” tiin."
"Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.","Chuongchun, lal chun rorêltu Rehum le, lekhaziektu Simsai le Samaria um an ruol danghai kuoma le, vadung râla khawsa hlakhai kuoma chun dawnna chu ân phur tah a, “In- remna um raw se, chuong ang peiin."
The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.,Kan kuoma lekhathawn in hung inphur kha ka hma ngeiah chiengtaka tiem a ni tah a.
"And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.","Chun, thu ka pêk a, zawngna chu siem a ni ta bawk a, chuongchun, inhmain hi khuo hin lalhai chungah helna lo siem tain, buoina le helna chu chutaka chun a lo um ta a nih ti hmu suok a ni tah a."
"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.","Vadung râl ram po po chunga rorêltu, Jerusalem vêla khan lal thilthawtheitak takhai an um a; an kuoma chun leiman dâm, ram man dâm, sie dâm pêk a ni hlak a."
"Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.","Tuhin, hieng mihai hi suktâwp dingin thupêk siem unla, hi khuo hi bâwl pei ni ta naw raw se; keima ngeiin thupêk ka siem hmakhat chun."
And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?,"Chun, hi thua hin vuoicha lo dingin fîmkhur rawh; lalhai sukpawi ding elin iengdingin am sietna chu a hung suok ding a na?” tiin."
"Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.","Chun, lal Artazerzia lekha chu Rehum le, lekhaziektu Simsai le, an ruolhai hmaa tiem a ni phing chun, inhmâwtakin Judahai kuomah Jeru- salema chun an feh a, thilthawtheina le thawluinain anni chu an suktâwp tah a."
Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.,"Chuongchun, Jerusalema um, Pathien in sinthaw chu a lo tâwp tah a; Persia lal Daria rorêl kum hnina chen chun châwlsan a ni tah a."
"Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they unto them.","Chun, zâwlneihai, Haggai le Iddo naupa Zekaria chun Juda ram le Jerusalema Juda umhai kuoma chun thu an hrillâwk a; Israel Pathien hmingin a nih anni chun thu an hrillâwk chu."
"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.","Chun, Sealtiel naupa Zerubbabel le Jozadak naupa Jesua chu an tho a, Jerusalema um, Pathien in chu an bâwl ṭan tah a; chun, an kuoma chun Pathien zâwlneihai chu anni ṭhang- puiin an um bawk a."
"At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?","Chu hun lai chun vadung râl tieng rorêltu Tattenai le Sethar- bozenai le an ruolhai chu an kuomah an hung a, an kuomah, “Hi in bâwl ding le, kul hi siemzo dingin tuin am thu a pêk cheu a?” an ta."
"Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building.","Chun, an kuoma chun hieng ang hin thu kan hril a, “Hi in bâwltuhai hi an hming ieng am a na?” tiin."
"But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.","Nisienlakhawm, an Pathien mit chu Juda upahai chunga chun a fuh a, chu thu chu Daria kuom a tlung a, a chungthua dawnna lekha chu a hung tlung hmakhat chun anni chu an suktâwp ta nawh a."
"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;","Vadung râltieng rorêltu Tattenai le Sethar-bozenai le a ruolhai Aphar- sak mihai, vadung râltienga umhai- in lal Daria lekhathawn an inphur chu:"
"they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace.","a kuoma chun lekhathawn an inphur a, chutaka chun hieng anga ziek hi a nih: “Lal Daria kuomah, inremna po po um raw se."
"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.","Juda ram bielah, Pathien in ropuitaka chun kan feh a, chu chu lung ropuitakhaia bâwl a na, a banghai chu thinga siem a na; chun, sin chu taimataka thaw pei a na, an kuta chun a hung hlawtling hle el a nih ti hi lal chun lo hre raw se."
"Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?","Chun, chuong upahai chu, ‘Hi in bâwl ding le kul hi siemzo dingin tuin am thu a pêk cheu a?’ tiin kan in- dawn a."
"We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.","Hung hrilfie ding chein, anni laia lua um mihai hminghai chu kan hung ziek theina dingin, an hminghai khawm kan indawn bawk a."
"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.","Chun, anni chun hieng ang hin an mi dawn a, ‘Hnuoi le vân Pathien siehlawhai kan na, Israel lal ropui- takin a lo bâwl zo tah, hi kum tam- taka lo bâwl tah in hi kan bâwl a nih."
"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.","Nisienlakhawm, chu hnunga chun kan thlatuhai chun vân Pathien chu an lo suklungsen a, ama chun Kaldai mi, Babulon lal, Nebukadnez- zar, hi in hi suksea, mihai chu Babulon tienga ṭhuoi sâwngtu kuta chun a pêk tah a."
"But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.","Nisienlakhawm, Babulon lal Kura inlal kum khatnaa chun, lal Kura chun hi Pathien in hi bâwlna dingin thupêk chu a siem ta a nih."
"And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;","Chun, rângkachak le tangka- raw bûr le bêlhai Nebukadnezzarin Jerusalem biekina inthawka a lâk a, Babulon biekina a hung lâkhai chu, chuonghai ngei chu lal Kura chun Babulon biekina inthawk chun a lâk suok a, mi pakhat a hming Sesbazzar, amain rorêltua a siem ngei kuoma chun chuong chu a pêk a nih;"
"and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place.","ama kuoma chun, Hieng bûr le bêlhai hi la la, fe la, Jerusalema um biekina chun sie rawh; chun, Pathien in chu a hmun ngaia ngei bâwl ni raw se, a tih a."
"Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.","Chun, chu Sesbazzar bawk chu a hung a, Jerusalema um Pathien in lungphûm a phûm tah a; chutaka inthawk tah tu chen hin bâwl a ni ta zing a, zo fel lo a la ni zing a nih,’ tiin."
"Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.","Chuleiin, tuhin lalin ṭha a ti zâwng a ni chun chu Babulona lal sum inah zawng ni sienla, Jerusa- lema Pathien in hi bâwlna dingin lal Kura chun thupêk a lo siem ta chun chutaka chun a um âwm sih a; chun, lal chun hi thu chungchânga hin ṭha a ti zâwng chu mi hung hril bawk raw se,” tiin."
"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.","Chun, lal Daria chun thupêk a siem a, Babulona ro siekhâwmna, lekhabu ina chun zawng a ni tah a."
"And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record:","Chun, Media biela lal inah Akmethaa chun lekha zuol hmu suok a ni tah a; chutaka chun hriet zingna dingin hieng anga ziek hi a na,"
"In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;","“Lal Kura inlal kum khatnaa chun, lal Kura chun thupêk a siem a; ‘Jerusalema Pathien in chungthua hin, in chu bâwl ni sienla, inthâwi- nahai an inhlânna hmun chu; chun, chu lungphûmhai khawm chu det- taka phûm ni nghe nghe raw se; chun, ân sângzie chu tawng sâwmruk, a khangtieng chu tawng sâwmruk bawk nîng a ta;"
"with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.","lung lientak takhai tlar thum le thing thar tlar khat leh: chun, sêng- hai chu lal ina inthawka pêk nîng a ta:"
"And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God.","Chun, Pathien ina rângkachak le tangkaraw bûr le bêl Jerusalema um biekina inthawka Nebukadnezzarin a lâk suok a, Babulona a lâkhai kha pêkkîr nâwk ni sienla, Jerusalema um biekinah an hmun sengah hung lâk nâwk nîng a ta; chun, Pathien ina chun sieng i tih,’ tiin."
"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence:","Chuleiin, tuhin vadung râltieng rorêltu Tattenai le, Sethar-bozenai le in ruol Apharsakhai, hitaka inthawk hin insiekieng unla, hi Pathien in sinthaw hi tosan el ro:"
let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.,Juda rorêltu le Juda upahai chun hi Pathien in hi a hmun ngeia chun bâwl el raw hai se.
"Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered.","Chu bâka chun hi Pathien in bâwl chungthua hin Juda upahai kuoma chun ieng am in thaw ding a na ti hi thupêk ka hung siem bawk a nih; lal thuomhnaw, vadung râltieng leiman ngei khawm, danga an um nawna dingin sênghai ngei khawm chu ṭhahnemngaitaka hieng mihai hi pêk ding an nih."
"And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;","Chun, an pawimaw ang taphawt- in, vân Pathien ta dinga pumraw- hmang thilinhlân dinga bâwngchal tuoi ni leh, berâmchal ni leh, berâm- tehai ni leh, Jerusalema um thiem- puhai thu ang peiin, bu dâm, chi dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm insam hlek loa ni tin tina pêk ni raw se;"
"that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.","vân Pathien kuoma riminhnik inthâwinahai an inhlân thei a, lal le a naupasalhai an dam sâwt theina ding khawma an ṭawngṭaipêk theina dingin."
"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:","Chun, hi thupêk khawm hi ka hung siem bawk a nih: tukhawm hi thu hi lo sukdanglam taphawt chu, a ina inthawka a tlungpûm chu kei dawk ni sienla, ama chu chutaka chun khai kânga khuopde ni raw se; hi lei hin a in chu êkpeinaa siem ni sienla:"
"and the God that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.","chutaka ama hming um dinga siemtu Pathien chun lalhai le hnam po po, hi hi sukdanglam dinga an kut phara, Jerusalema Pathien in um hi sukse tumtuhai chu pei thla raw se.

"Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.","Chun, lal Daria chun anni chu a tir lei chun vadung râltieng rorêltu Tattenai hai, Sethar-bozenai hai le an ruolhai chun chuong ang chun an thaw tah a."
"And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.","Chu, zâwlnei Haggai le Iddo naupa Zekaria hril ang ngeiin Juda upahai chun an bâwlin an hlawtling ta ngei a, Israel Pathien thupêk ang le Persia lal Artazerzia le Daria le Kura thupêk ang ngei chun an bâwl a, an zo tah a."
"And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.","Chun, hi in hi lal Daria rorêl kum rukna, Adar thla ni thum ni chun zo a ni tah a."
"And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai le thiempuhai le Levi mihai le sala intâng suokhai mi danghai chun hi Pathien in hi hlimtaka inhlânna an nei a."
"And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.","Chun, hi Pathien in inhlânnaa hin bâwngchal za khat, berâmchal za hni, berâmte za li an inhlân a; chun, suol thilinhlâna dingin Israel hnam lukipin kêlchal sâwmpahni an inhlân bawk a."
"And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.","Mosie lekhabua ziek a ni angin, thiempuhai chu an pâwl sengin, Levi mihai chu an chanpuol ang sengin Pathien rawngbâwl ding chun an sie tah a."
And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.,"Chun, sal intâng suokhai chun thla hmasatak ni sâwmpali ni chun Fekân ruoiṭhe chu an nei a."
"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.","Thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu anni le anni an lo insukthieng ta leiin, an rêng chun thieng an ni tah a; chuongchun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu sal intâng suokhai le an unauhai le thiempuhai le anni ta ding ngeiin an that tah a."
"And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,","Chun, Israel thlahai sala inthawka hung suok nâwk a, chu rama ringlo mi inthieng nawnaa inthawka Israel Pathien LALPA chu zawng dinga insie hranhai chun an fâk a,"
"and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.","chawl ṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe khawm chu hlimtakin ni sari sûng an hmang a: Lalpa chun anni chu a sukhlimin, Israel Pathien, Pathien in sin thawa chun an kuthai sukhrât dingin Assuria lal lungril chu anni chungah ân hertir ta nghâl sih a."
"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,","Hieng thilhai hnunga hin, Persia lal Artazerzia rorêl lai chu, Seraia naupa Ezra, Azaria naupa, Hilkia naupa,"

"this Ezra went up from Babylon. And he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.","hi Ezra hi Babulona inthawk chun a hang feh a: Israel Pathien LALPAIN a pêk Mosie dân ziek thiem mi a na; chun, lal khawm chun a Pathien LALPA kut a chunga a um ang pei chun a hni taphawt chu a phalpêk a."
"And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.","Chuongchun, lal Artazerzia inlal kum sarinaa chun Israel thlahai ṭhenkhat le thiempuhai le Levi mihai le hlasaktuhai le, kawtkhâr vêngtu- hai le, Nethinim mihai chu Jerusa- lema chun an hang feh a."
"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.","Ama chu lal inlal a kum sarinaa, a thla nganaa chun a nih Jerusalema a hung chu."
"For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.","Thla khatna, ni khat nia chun Babulona inthawk chun a fe suok ṭan a, a chunga Pathien kut ṭha innghat ang peiin thla ngana, ni khat ni chun Jerusalem chu a tlung tah a."
"For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.","Ezra chun LALPA dân chu zawng a, thawh a, rorêlnahai le thu- ruothai chun Israel rama chun inchûktir a lungrilin a tum tlat a."
"Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:","Hi hi LALPA thupêk le Israelhai kuoma a thuruot thuhai ziektu, thiempu le lekhaziektu Ezra kuoma lal Artazerziain lekha a pêk ziek- sâwng chu a nih,"
"Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.","“Lalhai lal, Artazerzia chun, thiempu Ezra, vâna Pathien dân ziektu Ezra kuomah muongna kim um raw se."
"I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.","Ka ram sûnga Israel mihai po po, an thiempuhai le Levi mihai leh, mânia Jerusalema fe inhâwkna neituhai chu nanga ruola fe dingin thupêk ka siem a nih."
"Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,",I kuta um i Pathien dân ang peia Jerusalem le Juda ram chungthu chu dâwpsuok dinga lal le a rorêltu pasarihai itir i ni leiin le;

"and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;","Babulon biel po poa mipuihai le thiempuhaiin Jerusalema an Pathien in ta dinga phaltaka an pêk, râng- kachak le tangkaruo i hmu thei zât zât chu chawi dinga tir i nih:"
"therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.","chuleichun, hi sum hi fîmkhur- takin bâwngchalhai, berâmchalhai, berâmtehai, an bu thilinhlân le dâwn mi thilinhlânhai leh inchâwng i ta, Jerusalema um i Pathien ina mâi- châma chun inhlân i tih."
"And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.","Chun, rângkachak le tangka la chuong chu i unauhai le nanga ngaia ṭha ang angin, in Pathien dit zâwngin hmang in tih."

"And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,","Keima, kei Artazerzia ngei hin thupêk ka siem a, vadung râltienga sum enkawltuhai po po kuoma chun, ‘Thiempu Ezra, vân Pathien dân ziektu hin thil a hni taphawt cheu chu fîmkhurtaka thaw dingin thu ka pêk cheu:"

"Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.","Chun, thiempuhai, Levi mihai, hlasaktuhai, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai, Nethinim mihai amanih, Pathien in rawngbâwltuhai hrim hrim chung- thua chun, anni chu leiman amanih, ram man amanih, sie amani khawm inchawitir chu dân ni naw nih tiin thu kan pêk bawk che a nih,’"
"And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not.","Chun, nang Ezra hin, i kawl Pathienin varna a pêk che ang peiin vadung râltienga mihai chunga rorêl dingin i Pathien dânhai hre mihai ang chu ram awptu le rorêltuhai dingin thlang i tih, a la hre nawhai chu inchuktir unla."
"And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.","Mi tukhawm i Pathien dân anga thaw lo le lal dân anga thaw lo chu a chungah inrangtaka rorêlthlûk ni sienla, thi dingin amanih, hnawtsuok dingin amanih, thuomhnawhai chân ding amanih, lungina khum ding amanih ni dingin,” tiin."
"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;",Jerusalema LALPA in cheimawi dinga lal lungrila thil hienga sietu ei thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu inpâk- in um raw se;
"and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes.

"And of the sons of Adonikam, that were the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males.","Chun, Adonikam naupahaia chun, chu chu a nuhnungtak a nih, hieng hi an hminghai chu a nih, Eliphelet, Jeuel le, Semaia hi; anni leh pasal sâwmruk."
"And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.","Bigvai naupahaia chun, Uthai le Zakkur; anni leh pasal sâwmsari."
"And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.","Anni chu Ahavaa luong lût vadunga chun ka kei khâwm tâwl a; chutaka chun ni thum lai chu kan riek a; chun, thiempuhai le mipuihai chu ka thlîr vêl chun Levi thlahai hrim ka hmu ta nawh a."
"Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.","Chuongchun, Eliezer, Ariel, Semaia, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zekaria, Mesullam hai mi lutakhai chu kân chah a, Joiarib le Elnathan inchûktirtuhai chu kân cha sa bawk a."
"And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.","Anni chu Kasiphia hmuna lal Iddo kuoma chun ka tir tah a; Pathien ina rawngbâwltu dinghai an mi hung ṭhuoipêk theina dingin, Kasiphia hmuna, Iddo le a unau Nethinim mihai kuoma an thuhril ding chu ka hril a."
"And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;","Chun, ka chunga kan Pathien kut ṭhatzie ang peiin anni chun mi lungril indiktak Israel naupa Levi naupa Mahli naupahai laia mi, Serebia, a unauhai le a naupasalhai leh sâwmpariet an mi hung ṭhuoi- pêk a;"
"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;","chun, Hasabia le Merari nau- pahai Jesaia, a unauhai le an nau- pasalhai leh sâwmhni;"
"and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.","chun, Nethinim mi, David le lalhaiin Levi mihai rawng bâwl dinga an pêkhai Nethinim mihai za hni le sâwmhni leh; an rêng chun hminga ko seng an nih."
"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.","Chun, kan thuomhnawhai po po le kan nau-le-têhai le keini ta dinga lampui tluong mi zawngpêk dinga, kan Pathien hmaa chun kan insuk- hnuoi theina dingin, Ahava vadunga chun bunghei ka rawt tah a."
"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.","Lal kuoma chun, “Ama zawng- tuhai chunga chun Pathien kut chu ṭhatna dingin a um a, ama nghat- santuhai po po chunga ruok chun, thilthawtheina le lunginsenna a um a nih,” kan lo ti ta si leiin, lampuia hmêlmahaia inthawka mi ṭhangpui dinga sakawr chung chuong mi le sipai pâwl lal kuoma hni kân zak sih a."
So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.,"Chuongchun, bu chu kan nghei a, hi hi ding hin kan Pathien chu kan ngên a: chuongchun, keini ngên- thlûkin ama chu a um tah a."
"Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,","Chun, thiempuhai laia a bîk deuhai sâwmpahni, Serebia, Hasabia le an unauhai sâwm ka sie hran a;"
"and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:","chuongchun, tangka le râng- kachak le bûr le bêlhai, kan Pathien in ta dinga thilpêk, lal le a rorêltuhai le, a mi ṭhahai le chutaka Israel umhai po poin an pêkhai chu anni chu ka bûkpêk tah a."
"I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;","Kei ngei khawma an kuta chun tangkaruo talent za ruk sâwmnga le, bûr le bêlhai talent za khat ka bûkpêk a; rângkachak talent za leh;"
"and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.","rângkachak maihûn sâwmhni, darik sâng khat bûk seng, chun, râng- kachak anga hlu ve bawk, dâr tle mi bêl pahni leh."
"And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers.","Chun, an kuomah ka hril a, “Nangni hi LALPA kuoma inthieng in na, a bûr le bêlhai khawm inthieng an nih; chun, hieng tangka le rângka- chakhai hi in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuoma inhâwktaka pêk an ni vawng a nih."
"Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.","Jerusalemah, LALPA in pin- danhaia, Israel pahnam mi ṭhahai le, Levi mihai le thiempu laltakhai hmaa in bûkpêk hmakhat chun, fîmkhur unla, kawl tlat ro,” tiin."
"So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.","Chuongchun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chun kan Pathien ina Jerusalema hung lâk dingin rângka- chak le tangkaruo chuong ang bûk chu an lâk tah a."
"Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way.","Chun, Jerusalema fe ding chun Ahava vadunga inthawkin thla khat- naa ni sâwmpahni ni chun kan suok tah a; chuongchun, kan Pathien kut chu kan chunga chun a um a, ama chun hmêlmahai le lampuia mîn chântu kuta inthawk chun a mi sansuok a."
"And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.","Jerusalem chu kan hung tlung a, chutaka chun ni thum lai chu kan hang um phawt a."
"And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest (and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites)—","A ni li ni chun a nih, chuong rângkachak le tangkaruo le bûr le bêlhai chu kan Pathien ina chun thiempu Uria naupa Meremoth kuta bûkin kan inhlân chu; ama le chun Phinehas naupa Eleazar chu a um nghe nghe a; chun, anni le chun, Levi mihai, Binnui naupa Noadia le Jesua naupa Jozabad chu an um bawk a;"
the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.,"a rêngin a zât le a bûkin; a bûk zât chu, chu huna chun ziek a ni nghe nghe bawk a."
"The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.","Chun, sal intâng mihai intâng- naa inthawka hung suokhai chun Israel Pathien kuoma chun Israelhai po po puolah; bâwngchal sâwmpahni le, berâmchal sâwmkuo paruk, berâmte sâwmsari pasari le; kêlchal sâwmpahni suol thilinhlâna dingin; pumrawhmang thilinhlânah an in- hlân tah a; hieng po po hi LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilinhlân a nih."
"And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.","Chun, lal thupêkhai chu vadung râla lal ram awptuhai le rorêltuhai kuoma chun an pêk suok tah a; chun, Pathien in le mipuihai chu ṭhangpuina an pêk tah a."
"Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.","Hieng thilhai hi thaw a ni zo chun, mi ṭhahai chu ka kuomah an hung a, “Israel mipuihai le thiem- puhai le Levi mihai hi hieng a rama um Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Jebus mihai, Ammon mihai, Moab mihai, Aigupta mihai le Amor mihaia inthawk hin insiekieng loin, an tirdakumnahai chu an thaw ve zing el a nih."
"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.","An naupasalhai le annihai ta ding ngei khawma an naunuhmeihai an nei sih a; chuongchun, chi inthieng chu annia hin hieng rama mihai le hin ân chawkpawl tah a; anih, hi bawsietnaa hin mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai hi a hmaṭhuoi an ni nghe nghe a nih,” an ta."
"And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.","Hieng thu hi ka hriet phing chun ka silfên le ka zakawfuol chu ka keithlêr a, ka lua ka sam chu ka phawi ṭil a, ka khâkhmul leh; mak- titakin ka ṭhung tah a."
"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.","Chun, sal intâng suokhai an bawsietna leia Israel Pathien thua lo inthin hlakhai po kha ka kuoma chun an hung inkhâwm a; chun, kei chu zântieng thilinhlân hun chenin maktiin ka ṭhung ta zing a."
"And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;","Chun, zântienga thilinhlân hun ding lai chun ka silfên le ka zakaw- fuol inek pum chun ka lungngainaa inthawk chun ka tho suok a; ka khûpin ka dingṭhaṭhuon a, LALPA ka Pathien kuom tieng chun ka bânhai ka phar a,"
"and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens.","“Aw ka Pathien, nanga tienga hung nghat khawm hi ka hmai a mâwkin kân zak a nih, ka Pathien, kan khawhlonahai chu kan lu chunga hin a hung pung deu deu a, kan suolhai chun vân a tawng ta a ni hi."
"Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.","Kan thlatuhai hun laia inthawk tah vawisûn ni chen hin suol namên loin kan suol ta a; kan khawhlonahai lei hin kan lalhai le kan thiempuhai chu hieng ram lalhai kuthaia hin pêk suokin an um tah a; vawisûn ni ang chen khawm hin hmêla ham- haina le, suksietnaa le sal intângnaa le kâwlhnâm kuoma pêkin an um hi."
"And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.","Tuhin mitkhapkâr tawitea ding- in kan Pathien LALPA zângaina chu hla bîkhai mi la mâksanpêk ding le, a hmun inthienga um zingna mi pe dingin kan Pathien chun kan mithai a hung sukvar a, kan sal intângnaa hin sukharna tlâwmte bêk a mi pêk theina dingin inlangtirin a um a."
"For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.","Sal intâng kan na, amiruokchu, kan sal intângnaa khawm chun kan Pathien chun a mi nghatsan ngai nawh a, Jerusalem le Juda rama kul- hai mi pe ding le, chutaka in siehai chu siem ṭha ding le kan Pathien in chu tungding dinga thathona mi pe dingin, Persia lalhai mithmua chun kan chungah lunginsietna a hung sukpung ta lem a."
"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,","Chuongchun, tuhin, Aw kan Pathien, hi thua hin iengam hril tâng kan ta? I thupêkhai chu kan lo nghat- san ta sih a:"
"which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:","khâng i siehlaw zâwlneihai hmanga i lo pêk tah, ‘Chu ram hluo dinga in fena ding chu ram thieng- naw, a rama mihai inthieng nawna- haia sukthieng naw, an inthieng- nawna kil khata inthawka kil khing- tieng chena sip, chu an inthieng naw- naa inthieng naw chu a nih."
"now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.","Chuleiin, tuhin, in naupasalhai chu an naunuhmeihai inneitir naw unla, in naunuhmeihai chu an naupa- salhai khawm inneitir bawk naw ro; kumkhuoa dingin an hausakna amanih, anni le inremna amanih zawng bawk naw ro, chu ram thil ṭha chu in fâk a, in hung hrât a, kum- khuoa dinga in thlahai ta dinga rochan dinga in mâksanpêk theina dingin,’ ti kha."
"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,","Chuong po po hnunga chun kan suol nasatak lei le, kan suksuolnahai leiin kan chungah a hung tlung a, nang kan Pathien hin kan khaw- hlonahaiin a phutâwk nêka nêp lemin i mi hrem a, a mahla khawm i mi la hlapêk a nih ti hmu zing si hin,"
"shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?","i thupêkhai chu kan bawsiet nâwkin, hieng pawrchenahai thawtu mipuihai le hin ṭhe ruolloin kan lân zawm zing ding am a nih? A suok ding um dêr loa, a mahla khawm hla dêr loa i mi kânghmang dêr hmakhat chun nang chu i lungdam ding am a nih?"
"O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before thee because of this.","Aw LALPA, Israel Pathien, nang chu în dik a, a suok a mahla chu i mi lo hlapêk ta sih a, vawisûn ni ang chen khawm hin: ngai ta, kan khaw- hlonahai leh i hmaa hin kan um a ni hi; hi hi lei hin tukhawm i hmaa chun an ngîr thei âwm si nawh a,” tiin."
