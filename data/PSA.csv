"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:","Mi rilohai remruot ang chu hraw loa, Mi suolhai lampuia khawm ngîr ngai loa, Hmusittuhai ṭhungphaa khawm ṭhung ngailo mi chu a hamṭha."
But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.,"A lâwmna chu LALPA dânah a ni lem a, A dân thu chu a sûn a zânin a ngaituo hlak a."
"And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.","Ama chu tuiluong kâwla thing phun, A huntaka ra insuo hlak, A hna khawm vuoi ngailo ang hi a nih: A thilthaw taphawt chu hlawtling pei a tih."
"The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.","Mi rilohai ruok chu chuong ang chu an ni nawh a, Busi thliin a lênhmang hlak ang hi an ni lem a."
"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.","Chuleiin, mi rilohai chu rorêlna hmaa chun ngîr thei naw ni hai a, Mi suolhai khawm mi felhai inkhâwmnaa chun ngîr thei bawk naw ni hai."
For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.,"Lalpa chun mi felhai lampui chu a hriet sih a, Mi rilohai lampui ruok chu bohmang a tih."
"Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?","Aw LALPA, iengdinga hla- takah i ngîr hlak am a na? Iengdinga lunginzîng hun laia inbi hlak am i na?"
In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.,Mi rilohai chapona leiin mi rimsihai chu hnawt zêkin an um hlak a; An thil suol ngaituo suokhaia chun anni ngei âwk raw se.
"For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, And the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth Jehovah.","Mi rilo chun a lungril thil dit zâwng chu a suong hlak a. Mi duâm chun LALPA chu a peithlâk a, a hmusit hlak."
"The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God.","Mi rilo chun chapo hmêl putin, “Iengkhawm mi ti hliek naw ni,” a ti hlak a, A ngaituona po po chu “Pathien hrim a um nawh,” ti ruok hi a nih."
"His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.","A umdânhai chu ieng lai khawmin a det zing a, I rorêlnahai chu chungtieng hlatakah, a hmu phâk nawah a um dai a: Ama dotuhai po po hlak chu a nuisan el a."
"He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.","A lungrila chun, “Châng naw ning: Suon po po chenin lungzîngin um naw ning,” a tih a."
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.,"A bau chu ṭawngse inphurna dâm, hlêmna dâm, suknawmnatna dâmin a sip a; A lei hnuoia chun thil suk- suolna le khawhlona a um a."
He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.,"Khaw tina inchân rûkna hmunhaiah a ṭhung hlak a, Hmun fienriela chun pawitâwk- lo mihai a that hlak a; A mitin iengkhawm thaw thei lo mi chu ân chânrûk zing hlak."
"He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.","Sakeibakneiin a pûka ân chân- rûk angin, ama chun fienriel- ah ân chânrûk zing hlak a; Mi rimsi man dingin an chân hlak a, Mi rimsi chu a man ngei a; chuongchun, a lênin a keihmang hlak."
"He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones.","A bawkphêk a, a kûn a, Iengkhawm thaw thei lohai chu mi hrâthai sukthlûkin an um hlak."
"He saith in his heart: God hath forgotten; He hideth his face, he will never see it.","A lungrila chun, “Pathienin a theinghil tah; A hmai a thup a, iengtika khawm hmu naw ni,” a ti hlak a."
"Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor.","Aw LALPA, tho la, aw Pathien, i kut hang inlet ta, Mi rimsihai chu theinghil naw rawh."
"Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it?","Ieng dinga mi rilo chun Pathien hmusitin, A lungrilah, “Iengkhawm mi ti hliek naw ti nih,” a ti hlak am a na?"
"Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth himself unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.","Hmu chu i hmu zing tah a, i kuta thung dingin buoina le lungzîngna chu în chik tah a, Iengkhawm thaw thei lo mi chu i kuomah a tlulût hlak a; Pa bo ṭhangpuitu i ni hlak kha."
"Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.","Mi rilo, bân chu suktliek la, Mi suol chu a rîtlona zawng suok la, i hmu naw dêr hmakhat chun."
Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land.,"LALPA chu kumkhawtluonga dingin laltak a na, Hnam tin chu ama rama inthawkin bohmang an tih."
"Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;","LALPA, zainêmhai dit zâwng chu ngaipêk i ta; An lungril chu buotsai i ta, i na chu inngaitir bawk i tih:"
"To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.","Pa neilo le nêksâwrna tuorhai chu ro rêlpêkna dingin, Hnuoia mi chu ṭiumtaka an um nâwk ta nawna dingin."
"Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands.","Ram po pohai, LALPA chawimawiin hlimtakin khêk ro;"
Serve Jehovah with gladness: Come before his presence with singing.,"Lâwm pumin LALPA rawng bâwl unla, Hlasak pumin a hmaah hung ro."
"Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: It is he that hath made us, and we are his; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.","LALPA chu Pathien a nih ti hre unla, A mi siemtu chu ama chu a na, ama ta ei nih; A mihai le a ran tlatna hmuna berâmhai chu ei nih."
"Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Give thanks unto him, and bless his name.","Lâwmthu hril pumin a kawtkhâra chun lût unla, Inpâk pumin a biekin inhuonna sûng tuollaia chun lût ro; A kuomah lâwmthu hril unla, a hming chu inpâk ro."
"For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness endureth for ever, And his faithfulness unto all generations.","LALPA chu a ṭha sih a, a zainêmna chu kumkhawtluongin um a ta, A ringumzie chu suon po po chenin um a tih."
"I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises.","Ngilneina le rorêlna thu chu hlain sak ka ta, Aw LALPA, nangma inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.,"Kawng ṭha famkima chun vartakin um ka ta, Aw iengtik âm ka kuomah hung i ta? Ka in sûngah lungril ṭha famkim putin um ka tih."
I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me.,"Thil ṭha naw hrim hrim ka mithmua chun sie naw ningah a, Fe pêthai thilthaw chu ka theida a nih; Keimaah kawp naw nih."
A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing.,"Lungril kâwmâw chun mi mâksan a ta, Thil suol hrim hrim hre naw ningah."
"Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.","Tukhawm a vênghai inrûka rêl taphawt chu, chu mi chu sukbohmang ka tih, Mit insâng le lungril chapo put mi chu ngaithei naw ning."
"Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.","Hi rama mi ringumhai chunga hin ka mit fûng a ta, ka kuoma an um theina dingin; Kawng ṭha famkim hrawtu chun, ama chun ka rawng bâwl a tih."
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.,"Mi hlêm hmang chu ka in sûngah um naw nih a, Khêl hril hmang chu ka mithmuah sukdetin um naw nih."
Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.,"Tûk tin hi rama mi rilohai hi sukbohmang ka ta, LALPA khawpuia inthawk hin thil suksuoltuhai po po sukbohmang dingin."
"Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee.","Aw LALPA, ka ṭawngṭâina hi lo ngai la, Ka khêkri hi i kuom tlung raw se."
Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.,"Ka lunginzîng ni chun keia kuomah i hmai thup naw la, Keia tieng hin i na hung sit la, Ka ko pha che chun mi hung dawn vak rawh."
"For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand.","Ka dam sûng nihai hi meikhu angin ân zâm hmang a, Ka ruhai hi thingthu angin a sah a,"
"My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread.","Ka lungril hi hlobet anga em hlumin a um a, a vuoi zo tah: Bu fâk khawm ka theinghil sih a."
By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh.,"Kân rûm rîk leiin, Ka ruhai hi ka tisaah a kawp tlat a nih."
I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.,"Thlalêr tuivalawng ang ka na, Khaw hmun hlui simbuk ang el ka lo ni tah a."
"I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top.","Ka meng zing a, Chawngzawng a khât chaua in chunga um ang ka lo ni tah a."
Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me.,"A mi dotuhai chun sûnnithlâkin an mi hrilsiet hlak a, Ka chunga ṭiumhai chun vânnikhâmnain an mi hmang a."
"For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,","Vut hi bu angin ka fâk a, Ka dâwn ding chu mitthli leh ka pawl ta sih a."
"Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.","I lungninaw êm êm le i lunginsen leiin, Nangin i mi lâk kâng a, i mi pei ta sih a."
My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass.,"Ka dam sûng nihai hi hlim bo tieng intung ta ang a na, Hlobet angin ka vuoi tah a."
"But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; And thy memorial name unto all generations.","Aw LALPA, nang ruok chu kumkhawtluongin um i ta, Nangma hriet zingna khawm suon po po chenin um bawk a tih."
"Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come.","Tho i ta, Zion tlâng chu lunginsiet i tih, Ama chu lunginsiet a hun ta sih a, anih, hun ruot chu a tlung tah."
"For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust.","I siehlawhai chun a lunghai chu an ngainain, A pilvut chen khawm an lunginsiet sih a."
"So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.","Chuongchun, hnam tinin LALPA hming chu ṭîng an ta, Hnuoia lal po pohai chun i ropuina chu ṭî bawk an tih."
For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory.,"LALPA chun Zion khuo chu ân ngîr nâwk ta sih a, A ropuinaa inthuomin ân lang tah."
"He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.","Pasiehai ṭawngṭâina chu a ngaisak a, An ṭawngṭâina chu a hmusit nawh."
This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.,"Chu chu ruolthar la hung um dinghai ta dingin ziek nîng a ta, Hnam siema la hung um ding chun LALPA chu inpâk an tih."
For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;,"Ama chun a hmun inthieng insângtaka inthawkin a zuk thlîr a, LALPA chun vâna inthawk khin hnuoi hi a hmuh a;"
To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;,"Mi intâng inrûm chu ngai ding le, Thi dinga ruothai chu sût dingin."
"That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;","Mihaiin LALPA hming chu Zion khuoa le, Ama inpâkna thu chu Jerusalem khuoa an hril theina dingin;"
"When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.","LALPA rawngbâwl dinga, Mi tin le ram tin an inkhâwm pha chun."
He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.,"Ama chun lam kâra hin ka tha a sukṭhum a, Ka dam sûng hi a suktâwi a."
"I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations.","“Aw ka Pathien, ka vânglai nihaia hin mi la hmang naw la, Nanga kumhai chu suon um sûng po po um a tih,” ka tih a."
Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands.,"Leihnuoi innghatsan chu tiena i phûm tah a na, Vânhai khawm i kutsuok an nih."
"They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:","Chuonghai chu la bohmang a ta, nang ruok chu um zing i tih. Anih, chuong po pohai chu silfên angin la hlui a ta, Puon angin thleng i ta, hung danglam tâng a tih."
"But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end.","Nang ruok chu i pângngai zing a, I kumhai chun bo ni hrim nei naw ni."
"The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee.","I siehlawhai nauhai chu um zing an ta, An thlahai chu i hmaah sukdetin um an tih."
"Bless Jehovah, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless his holy name.","Aw ka hringna, LALPA chu inpâk la, Ka sûnga um po pohai, a hming inthieng chu inpâk ro."
"Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits:","Aw ka hringna, LALPA chu inpâk la, A thilthaw ṭhat po po chu theinghil naw."
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;,"Ama chun i rîtlona po po a ngaidam hlak a, I natna po po a sukdam hlak."
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;,"Bohmangnaa inthawkin i hringna chu ân tlan hlak a, Zainêmna le lainatnahai ân khumtir hlak cheh a."
"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.","I bau chu thil ṭhain a sukkhawp hlak a; chuongchun, i tleirâwlna chu mupui anga siemtharin a um nâwk hlak."
"Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed.","LALPA chun nêksâwrna tuorhai po po ta dingin, Thil felhai thawpêkin, rohai a rêlpêk hlak."
"He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.","A lampuihai chu Mosie ân hriettir a, A thil thawhai chu Israel thlahai ân hriettir bawk a."
"Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.","LALPA chu lainatnaa sip, mi lunginsiet theitak, Lunginuoitak, ngilneina hautak a nih."
He will not always chide; Neither will he keep his anger for ever.,"Ama chun hal rawp naw ni a, A lungsen chu vawng kumkhuo naw ni."
"He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.","Ei suolnahai angin ei chungah a thaw nawh a, Ei rîtlona angin a mi thung bawk nawh."
"For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.","Vân khi hnuoi chung insângtaka a um angin, Ama ṭituhai chungah a ngilneina chu a nasa a nih."
"As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.","Sak le thlang ân hlat angin, Ei bawsietnahai chu ei kuoma inthawkin a sie hmang dai tah a."
"Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.","Pain a nauhai a lunginsiet ang hin, LALPA chun ama ṭituhai chu a lunginsiet hlak."
For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.,"Ei taksa siem dân hi a hriet a, Pilvut el ei nih ti a hriet zing leiin."
"As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.","Mihriem chu, a dam sûng nihai chu hlobet ang a na, Phûl pâr ang hin a vul hlak a."
"For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.","Thliin a mût a, a bo hlak a nih, A umna chun hre nâwk ta naw nih."
"But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children’s children;","LALPA zainêmna ruok chu a ṭituhai chunga chun chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin um a ta, A felna khawm an thlahai thlahai chenin;"
"To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.","A thuthlung zâwm taphawt le, A thuhrilhai awi tuma hre zinghai taphawt chunga chun."
Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.,"LALPA chun a lalṭhungpha chu vâna khin a sukdet a, A ram chun iengkim chungah ro a rêl a."
"Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word.","A vântirkohai, a thu ngaia, a thu zâwma, hrâtnaa ropui hlakhai, LALPA chu inpâk ro."
"Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.","A sipaihai, LALPA chu inpâk ro, A dit zâwng thawh a, a rawng bâwltuhai,"
"Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.","A rorêlna hmun po poa a thilthaw po pohai, LALPA chu inpâk ro: Aw Ka hringna, LALPA chu inpâk rawh."
"Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:","Aw ka hringna, LALPA chu inpâk rawh, Aw LALPA ka Pathien, nang chu i ropui êm êm a, Chawimawina le ropuinain în thuom a."
Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;,"Nang chun var chu puon angin în bel a, Vânhai khi puon in chung angin i kei phar a."
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;,"Nang chun i pindan chunghnung kalkhanghai chu tuiahai khin i khang a, Sûmhai khi i tawlailîrah i siem a; Thli thla chungahai chun i lêng a."
Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;,"Thlihai chu i vântirkohai în changtir a, Meichawk dur dur hai chu i rawngbâwltuahai în changtir hlak."
"Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever.","Leihnuoi innghatsanhai chu i phûm a, Kumkhawtluonga ân hnîng nawna dingin."
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.,"Nang chun leihnuoi hi tui inthûktak chu puon angin în siltir a, Tuihai chu tlânghai chunga chun an um puou a."
At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away,"I kâwkna lei chun an tlân- hmang a, I vâninrûm ri lei chun an fe hmang ta vak a."
"(The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.","Tlângahai an hung ngîr suok a, Ruomahai an ṭum thlah a, An ta dinga hmun i buotsaina tieng chun."
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.,"An khêl naw dingin ri i khang a, Hnuoi chîm tlum dinga an lêt nâwk ta nawna dingin."
He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;,"Nang chun vadung ruomhaia dâm chun tuihnârhai i tir suok a, Tlânghai kâra chun an luong a."
They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.,"Chuonghai chun ram sa tinrênghai kuomah dâwn ding an pêk hlak a, Ram sabengtunghai chun an dangchâr an sukbo hlak."
By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.,"A kamhaia chun chunglêng va- têhaiin umna an nei hlak a, Thing buk laia chun an inhrâm hlak."
He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.,"Ama chun a pindan chunghnunga inthawk khin tlânghai chu tuiin a châwm hlak a, Hnuoi hi i thilthaw rahaiin a khawp hlak."
"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,","Hlobet chu ranhai ta dingin ân mâwngtir a, Thlai chu mihriem hmang dingin ân mâwngtir bawk a, Hnuoia inthawk fâk ding ân suoktir theina dingin."
"And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart.","Mihriem lungril suklâwmna uoin leh, A hmai suktlawrna ding hriek leh, Mihriem lungril sukhrâtna bei leh."
"The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;","LALPA thinghai chu an khawp hlak, Lebanon tlânga sidar thing a iphunhai chu."
"Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.","Chutaka chun vatêhai chun bu an sep hlak a, Vakâwl ruok chu fâr thing chu a in a nih."
The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.,"Tlâng insânghai chu sakêl ta ding a na, Lungpuihai chu mazupui ta dinga inhumhimna a nih."
He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.,"Ama chun thla khi hunbi hrietna dingin a ruot a, Nisa khin a tlâk pha chu a hriet hlak."
"Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.","Nang chun inthim i siem a, zân a hung na, Chu huna chun ramhnuoia sa tinrênghai chu an tla suok hlak."
"The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.","Sakeibaknei vânglaihai chun an sa se ding chu inrûmkhumin, Pathien kuoma inthawka an fâk ding an zawng hlak."
"The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.","Nisa a suok a, an fe hmang a, An umna pûk senga chun an zâl hlak."
Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.,"Mihriem chu sinthaw dingin a suok a, Zântieng chenin inrimtakin a thaw hlak."
"O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches.","Aw LALPA, i thilthawhai chu a va tam de! Varnain i siem vawng a nih: Leihnuoi hi i hausaknain a sip a ni hi."
"Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.","Sawtaka sawn tuisuoriet a um a, nasatak lientak el chu, Sawtaka sawn thilhring bawk- vâka lâwn tiem sêng lo an um a, Sa chîn le sa lienhai chu."
"There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.","Sawtaka sawn lawnglienhai an fe saw, Sawtaka sawn leviathan a um a, a sûnga inhnel dinga i siem chu."
"These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season.","Chuong po po chun an nghâk seng che a nih, A hun taka an bu i pêk seng hlakna dingin."
"Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.","An kuoma i pêk taphawt an rût hlak a, I kut i phar a, ṭhatnain an khawp hlak."
"Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.","I hmai i thup a, an lunginzîng hlak a, An thuok chu i lâkpêk a, an thih a, An pilvuta chun an kîr nâwk hlak."
"Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.","I thlarau chu i tir suok a, siemin an um hlak; Hnuoi chung khawm hi i siem thar nâwk hlak."
Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:,"LALPA ropuina chu kumkhaw- tluongin um sienla, LALPA chu a thilthawahai chun hlim raw se."
"Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.","Ama chun hnuoi hi a en a, ân thin hlak a, Tlânghai chu a them a, a khu suok hlak."
I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.,"Ka dam sûng po chu LALPA chawimawiin hla sak ka ta, Ka hring sûng po chu ka Pathien chu inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.,"Ka ngaituona hi ama ta dingin thlumtak ni raw se, Kei chu LALPAA chun hlim ka tih."
"Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.","Mi suolhai chu hnuoia inthawk hin sukbohmangin um hai sienla, Mi rilohai chu um ta naw raw hai se! Aw ka hringna, LALPA chu inpâk rawh! LALPA chu inpâk ro!"
"Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.","Aw, LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril unla, a hming lam ro; Mi tin lai chun a thilthaw chu inhriettir ro."
"Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.","Ama chawimawiin hla sak unla, ama inpâkin sak ro; A thilmak thaw po po thu chu titi ro."
Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.,"A hming inthieng chu sawng ro, LALPA zawngtuhai lungril chu hlim raw se."
Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.,"LALPA le a hrâtna chu zawng unla, A hmêl chu zawng rawp ro."
"Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,","A thilmak thawhai chu hre zing ro, A thilmakhai le a baua a rorêl suokhai chu:"
"O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.","Aw, a siehlaw Abraham thlahai, Jakob thla, a ithlanghai."
He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.,"Ama chu LALPA ei Pathien chu a nih, A rorêlhai chu hnuoi chung po poa hin a um."
"He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,","A thuthlung chu kumkhuoin a hriet hlak a, Suon sâng khat chena a thu lo pêk chu;"
"The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,","Abraham kuoma a thuthlung le, Isak kuoma a înkhâmna chu."
"And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,","Chu ma chu thuruot ni dingin Jakob kuomah a sukdet a, Israel kuoma kumkhawtluong thuthlung dingin;"
"Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;","“Kanaan ram hi i kuomah pêng ka ti che, I rochan puol ding chu,” tiin;"
"When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.","Mi tlâwmte chau, an ni lai khan, Anih, tlâwmte chau chu rama chun mikhuol an ni nâwk nghâl sih a."
"And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.","Hnam tum tum kuomah an fe lawn an fe lawn a, Ram tum tuma inthawkin mi tum tumhai kuomah."
"He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,","Tu inêksâwr khawm a phal nawh a, Anih, anni leiin lalhai khawm a kâwk a,"
"Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.","“Ka hriek nâlhai chu tâwk naw unla, Ka zâwlneihai pawi hrim hrim khawm tâwk naw ro,” tiin."
And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.,"Chu rama tla dingin ṭâm a ko a, Fâk ding hrim hrim ân um nawtir tah a."
He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:,"An hmaah mi a tir a, Josef chu siehlaw dinga zawrin a um a,"
"His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in chains of iron,","A kehai chu kawlin an suk- na a, Thîr khaidiet bunin a um tah a."
"Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.","A thu a tlung hmakhat chun, LALPA thu chun ama chu a fie hlak a."
"The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.","Laltak chun mi a tir a, a sût a, Ân suo tah a, mi tin rorêltu ngei chun."
"He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;","A sûnghai chungah hotua le, A sum po po chunga rorêltuah a siem a;"
"To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.","A mi lienhai chu a nuom nuoma a khuop ding le, A upahai sukvar dingin."
Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.,"Israel khawm chu Aigupta ramah a feh a, Jakob ruok chu Ham rama chun a um ta hrih a."
"And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.","A mihai chu nasatakin a sukpung a, Anni dotuhai nêkin a sukhrât ta lem a."
"He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.","A mihai theida dingin an lungril ân lêttir a, A siehlawhai chunga vervêktaka thaw dingin."
"He sent Moses his servant, And Aaron whom he had chosen.","A siehlaw Mosie chu a tir a, A mi thlang Aron leh."
"They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.","Anni chun ân chiknahai chu anni lai an inentir a, Ham rama chun thilmakhai an inentir a."
"He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.","Ama chun inthim a tir a, a sukthim tah a, Chuongchun, a thuhai chu an sêl ta nawh a."
"He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.","An tuihai chu thisena ân changtir a, An ngahai chu a sukhlum tah a."
Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.,"An ram chu uin a sip tah a, An lalhai pindana chen khawm."
"He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.","Ama chun thu a hril a; chuongchun, tho tamtak an hung a, Hrik khawm an ram sûng po poah an hung bawk a."
"He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.","An kuomah ruo aiah riel a pêk a, An rama chun mei chawk zawr zawr a pêk ta bawk a."
"He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.","An grêp hruihai le an theichang kûnghai a sukhlum a, An rama thinghai chu a sukthliek ta bawk a."
"He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,","Ama chun thu a hril a; chuong- chun, khâuhai an hung a, Tuktulunghai leh, tiem seng ruollo tawp el hin."
"And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.","Chuonghai chun an rama thlai tinrênghai chu an fâk zo a, An hnuoi rahai khawm an fâk zo ta bawk a."
"He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.","An rama nau lutîr um po po a sukhlum a, An hrâtna po po ra hmasatakhai chu."
And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.,"Chuongchun, tangka le râng- kachak leh a ṭhuoi suok a, Ama hnamhai laia chun mi hrât naw pakhat khawm an um dêr nawh."
Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.,"An suok lai chun Aiguptahai chu an lâwm a, Anni chu an hung ṭî ta leiin."
"He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.","Ama chun hlietu dingin sûm ân zâmtir a, Zâna êntu dingin mei a pêk bawk a."
"They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.","An hnih a; chuongchun, vamîm a hung ṭhuoi a, Vân buin anni chu a sukkhawp tah a."
"He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places like a river.","Lungpui chu a hawng a; chuongchun, tui a hung suok zur zur a, Hmun ṭâwlahai chun vadung ang el hin a luong tah a."
"For he remembered his holy word, And Abraham his servant.",A thu inthieng kha a hriet zing sih a: A siehlaw Abraham le khan.
"And he brought forth his people with joy, And his chosen with singing.","Chuongchun, a mihai chu hlimtakin a ṭhuoi suok tah a, A mi thlanghai chu hla sak pei pumin."
And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:,"Chun,hnam tin ramhai chu an kuomah a pêkpêk a, Anni chun mi tin thaw suoksa chu an hluo tah a;"
"That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.","A thuruothai chu an zâwm thei a, A dânhai chu an vawngṭhat theina dingin. LALPA chu inpâk ro."
Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.,"LALPA chu inpâk ro, LALPA kuoma chun lâwm- thu hril ro, ama chu a ṭha sih a; A ngilneina chun kumkhuo a dai sih a."
"Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?","Tu am LALPA thilthaw ropuitakhai hril thei a, Ama inpâkna po po inhriettir vawng thei le?"
"Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.","Rorêlna vawng ṭhahai chu an hamṭha ie, Ieng lai khawma feltaka thawtu leh."
"Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,","Aw LALPA, i mihai i ditsakna chun mi hre zing la, Aw i Sandamna leh mi hung kan rawh."
"That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.","I mi thlanghai tluongtlungzie ka hmu thei a, I hnamhai lâwmnaa chun ka hlim thei a, I rochanhai le ka sawng theina dingin."
"We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.","Kan thlatuhai le khan thil kan suksuol a, Thil suol kan thawh a, suoltakin kan thaw tah a."
"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.","Kan thlatuhai khan Aigupta rama khan i thilmak thaw- hai kha an hriet thiem nawh a, I ngilneina nasatak kha an hriet zing ta nawh a, Tuisuorietah an hel ta lem a, Tuisuoriet Sena khan."
"Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.","Chuong sa khawm chun ama hming leiin anni chu a sandam tah a, A thilthawtheina ropuitak chu ân hriettir theina dingin."
"He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.","Tuisuoriet Sen chu a hal a; chuongchun, a kang tah a, Chuongchun, anni chu thlalêra ṭhuoi tlang ang elin tui inthûktakahai chun a ṭhuoi tlang tah a."
"And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.","Anni theidatu kuta inthawk chun a sandam a, Hmêlma kuta inthawk chun ân tlan tah a."
And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.,"Tuihai chun anni dotuhai chu ân khum zo a, Pakhat khawm dama suok an um ta nawh a."
Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.,"Chuong lai chun a thuhai chu an ring a, Ama inpâkna hla an sak a."
"They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,","Nisienlakhawm, a thilthaw- hai chu an theinghil vak tah a, A remruot chu an nghâk pei nawh a."
"But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.","Thlalêra chun thil an châk êm êm a, Ram ṭâwla chun Pathien an fie ta lem a."
"And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.","An thil hni chu a pêk a, Nisienlakhawm, an hringnaa chun chêrna ân lûttir a,"
"They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.","An riebûka chun Mosie chu an îtthîk a, LALPA mi inthieng, Aron leh."
"The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.","Hnuoi chu a kah a, Dathan chu a lem a, Abiram pâwlhai chu ân khum zo tah a."
And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.,"An pâwl lai chun mei sukchawkin a um a, Meichawk chun mi rilohai chu a kâng hmang tah a."
"They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.","Horeb tlânga chun bâwngte lim an siem a, A lim sung chu an biek tah a."
Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.,"Chuong ang chun an ropuina chu, Bâwngchal hlobet fa mi ang chauah an inchangtir tah a."
"They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,","Pathien an sandamtu an theinghil tah a, Aigupta rama thil ropuitak tak thawtu chu;"
"Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And terrible things by the Red Sea.","Ham rama thilmaktakhai, Tuisuoriet Sen panga thil râpthlâktakhai thawtu chu."
"Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.","Chuleiin, sukbohmang rawi a tih, tia, a lunginsen sukkîr dingin, A mi thlang Mosie chu a lûtna dinga chun a hmaah ngîr naw sien lem chu, Sukbohmang a tih, ti a hril a."
"Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,","Anih, ram ditumtak chu an ngainêp a, A thu chu an ring nuom nawh a."
"But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.","An puon inahai chun an chier ta lem a, LALPA râwl chu an ngai nuom nawh a."
"Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,","Chuleiin anni tieng chun a kut a phar a, Anni chu thlalêra sukthlûkna ding le,"
"And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.","An chi thla dinghai chu hnam tin lai a sukthlûk a, Ram tina a sukdarna dingin."
"They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.","Baal-peor tieng chun an kawp a, Mithi kuoma thilinhlânhai chu an fâk ve tah a."
Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.,"Chuongchun, an thilthawhaiin ama chu an suklungsen a, Chuongchun, hri chu an chungah a hung inlêng tah a."
"Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.","Chuong lai chun Phinehas chu a ngîr a, ro a rêl a; Chuongchun, hri chu sukboin a um tah a."
"And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.","Chu chu a felnaa ruot a nih, Kumkhuoin suon po po chenin."
"They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;","Meriba tuiahai khawm chun ama chu an suklungsen a, Chuongchun, anni leiin Mosie chungah thil ṭha naw a tlung ta hiel a,"
"Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.","A thlarau chungah an hel a, A hmûra ṭha nawtaka a hril leiin."
"They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,","LALPAIN an kuoma sukbo- hmangna thu a pêk angin, Mipuihai chu an sukbohmang nawh a."
"But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,","Hnam tin chu an pâwl a, An thilthawhai chu an inchûk lem a."
"And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.","A milim rawnghai an bâwl a, Chuong chu an ta dingin châng a lo ni tah."
"Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,","Anih, khawhri kuoma chun an naupasalhai le an naunu- hmeihaiin an inthâwi a;"
"And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.","Thisen pawitâwklo, an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai thisen ngei chu an insuo tah a, Chuonghai chun Kanaan ram milimhai kuomah an inthâwi a, Chu ram chu thisenin a lo pawrche tah a."
"Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.","Chuongchun, an sinthawhaia sukkhawloin an um tah a, An thilthawhaia chun an hung uire tah a."
"Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.","Chuleiin, LALPA lung chu a mihai chungah ân thawk a, A rochan chu a tirdak tah a."
And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.,"Chuongchun, anni chu hnam tin kutah a pêk a, Anni theidatuhai chun an chungah ro an rêl tah a."
"Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.","Anni dotuhaiin an nêksâwr a, An kut hnuoia chun suktlâwmin an um tah a."
"Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.","Vawi tamtak anni chu a san- dam a, Nisienlakhawm, an remruotnaa chun an hel hlak a, An rîtlonaa chun sukhnuoiin an um tah a."
"Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:","Chuong sa khawm chun, ama chun an khêkri chu a hriet chun, An lunginzîng chu a ngaisak a."
"And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.","A thuthlung chu anni a hrietpêk zing a, A ngilneina nasatzie ang peiin a lungril ân lêt tah a."
He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.,"Sala ṭhuoituhai po po chu, Anni a lunginsiettir a."
"Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.","Aw LALPA, kan Pathien, mi sandam la, Hnam tin laia inthawk hi mi ṭhuoi khawm rawh: I hming inthieng kuoma lâwmthu hril ding le, Nangma inpâkna chawimawi dingin."
"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.","LALPA Israel Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se. Chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin. Mi po po chun, “Amen,” ti raw se; LALPA chu inpâk ro."
O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.,"Aw LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ro, ama chu a ṭha sih a; A ngilneina khawm kumkhuoin a um ding a ni sih a,"
"Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,","LALPA mi intlanhai chun chuong ang chun hril raw se, Dotu kuta inthawka a întlan,"
"And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.","Ram tina inthawka a ṭhuoi khâwm, Sak le thlang, sim le hmâra inthawkhai dâm chun."
They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.,"Thlalêra ram ṭâwl lampuia chun an invâk an invâk a, Mihriem umna khuo hrim hrim an hmu nawh a."
"Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.","Phîngṭâm le dangchârin, An hringna chu an sûngah a chau tah a."
"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko tah a, Ama chun an lunginzîngnaa inthawk chun a sanhim a."
"He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.","Mihriem umna khuoa an fe theina dingin, Lampui tlûntakah a ṭhuoi tah a."
"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw, mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a ngilneina lei le, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien aw!"
"For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.","Ama chun hringna thil châk êm êm chu a sukkhawpin, Hringna phîngṭâm chu ṭhatnain a sukkhawp sih a."
"Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,","Inthim hnuoia le thina hlima ṭhung a, Rinumna le thîra khuophai chu;"
"Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:","Pathien thuhai chungah an hel a, Achunghnungtak remruot chu an ngainêp leiin."
"Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.","Ama chun an lungril chu inrimnain a sukhnuoi a, An tluh a, ṭhangpuitu ding hrim an um si nawh a."
"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko a, Ama chun an lungzîngnaa inthawk chun a sandam a."
"He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.","Inthim hnuoi le thina hlima inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok a, An khuopnahai chu a suktan tah a."
"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a ngilneina lei le, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien aw!"
"For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.","Ama chun dâr kawtkhârhai chu a suksiet a, A kalna thîrtluonhai chu a sukbawng ta sih a."
"Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.","Mi invêthai chu an bawsietna lei le, An rîtlonahai leiin an insukrinum hlak a."
Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.,"An hringna chun fâk ding tinrêng hi a tirdak hlak a, Thina kul kawtkhârhai chu an hnai hlak a."
"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko a, Ama chun an lungzingnaa inthawk chun a sandam hlak."
"He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth them from their destructions.","A thu chu a tirsuok a, anni chu a sukdam hlak a, An bohmangna dinghaia inthawk chun a sanhim hlak."
"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a ngilneina lei le, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien chu aw!"
"And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.","Anni chun lâwmthu hrilna inthâwinahai chu inhlân hai sienla, A thilthawhai chu hlaa sakin hril raw hai se."
"They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;","Tuisuorieta lawng liena zu feh a, Tui lientak chunghaia sin thaw hlakhai chun,"
"These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.","Chuonghai chun LALPA thilthawhai le, Tui inthûktaka a thilmak thawhai chu an hmu hlak."
"For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.","Ama chun thu a pêk a, thlipui ân hrângtir a, Chu chun a tuifâwnhai chu a suksâng hlak."
"They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.","Vân tieng an hung tuol tuol a, inthûktakah an ṭum nâwk tuol tuol hlak, Lunginzîngna leiin an hringna chu ân tuihmang hlak."
"They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits’ end.","Zurui angin an thle an thleh a, an pêm nawk nawk hlak a, Um ngaina hrim hrim an hriet ngai nawh."
"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko a, Ama chun an lungzîngnaa inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok hlak."
"He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.","Thlipui chu a sukma ṭhuop a, Chuongchun, a tuifâwnhai a re ṭhup hlak."
Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.,"Chun, a re ta leiin an lâwm hlak a; Chuongchun, ama chun an ngaitak likilkawia chun a ṭhuoi tlung hlak."
"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw, mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a zainêmna lei le Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien chu aw!"
"Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.","Anni chun mihai inkhâwmnaah ama chu inpâk sienla, Upahai ṭhungnaa chun inpâk raw se."
"He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;","Ama chun vadungpuihai chu thlalêrah ân changtir hlak a, Tuihnârhai chu hnuoi ṭâwlah ân changtir bawk hlak."
"A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.","Ram ṭha chu ram ṭâwl chawkah ân changtir hlak a, A sûnga umhai rîtlona leiin."
"He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.","Thlalêr chu dîlah ân changtir hlak a, Ram ṭâwl chu tuihnârahai ân changtir bawk hlak."
"And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,","Chutaka chun phîngṭâmhai chu ân umtir hlak a, Umna ding khuo an buotsai a."
"And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.","Lohai an nei a, grêp huonhai an siem a, A ra hung punghai chu an hmu theina dingin."
"He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.","Anni chu mal a sâwm hlak a, nasataka sukpungin an um a, An ranhai chu a kiem a phal ngai nawh a,"
"Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.","Chun, nêksâwrna dâm, rinum- na dâm, lungngai dâm leiin, An kiem ta sawt sawt a, an kûn ta thlawk thlawk a."
"He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.","Ama chun mi lienhai chungah hmusitna a bunthlâk hlak a, Thlalêr lampui hrim hrim um nawnaa chun ân vâktir ân vâktir a."
"Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh him families like a flock.","Nisienlakhawm, rimsihai chu rinumnaa inthawkin hmun insângah a dawm kai hlak a, Ran ruol angin sûnghai a siempêk hlak."
"The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.","Mi indiktakhai chun chu chu hmûng an ta, lâwm an tih, Rîtlona po po chun a bau hip a tih,"
Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.,"Tukhawm a var taphawt chun chuong chu vawng ṭhâng an ta, LALPA ngilneina chu ngaituong an tih."
"My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.","Aw Pathien, ka lungril hi adet a nih; Hla sak ka tih, anih, inpâkna hla sak ka tih, ka ropuina ngeiin."
"Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.","Perkhuong le ṭingṭanghai, har ro, Kei chu zîngkâr har ka tih."
"I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.","Aw LALPA, mi tin laiahai chun lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, Hnam tin laia chun nangma inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth reacheth unto the skies.,"I ngilneina chu vân khûm khawpin a nasa sih a, I thutak chun vân dumhai khi a tawng hiel bawk a."
"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.","Aw Pathien, nang chu vân khûm dai khin chawimawiin hung um la, I ropuina chu hnuoi chung po poa hin chawimawiin um bawk raw se."
"That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.","I dittakhai hi sanhima an um theina dingin, I kut changtiengin sandam la, mi hung dawn rawh."
"God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.","Pathienin a înthiengnaa chun hieng ang hin a hril a, “Hlimtakin, Sekem khuo chu sem ka ta, Sukkoth ruom chu semdar bawk ka tih."
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.,"Gilead chu ka ta a na, Manasse ka ta a na; Ephraim khawm chu ka lu humhimna a na; Judai chu ka lalhmawl a nih."
Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.,"Moab chu kân sâwpna bêl a na, Edoma chun ka kekawk pei ka ta, Philistin chu khêk khum ka tih,” tiin."
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?,Khawpui kul neia chun tuin am mi ṭhuoi lût a ta? Edoma chun tuin am mi ṭhuoi a ta?
"Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.","Aw Pathien, nangma ngeiin i mi thlauthlâk a ni naw am a nih? Aw Pathien, kan sipaihai kuoma hlak i suok ve ta si nawh a."
Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.,"A mi dotuhai thaw dingin mi ṭhangpui la, Mihriem ṭhangpuina chu teplo mei mei a ni sih a."
Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.,"Pathien zârah huoitakin thâwng ei tih, Ama chu a mi dotuhai sir detu ding a ni sih a."
"Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;","Aw kan inpâk Pathien, to zing naw la,"
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.,Mi rilo bau le bau mi hlêm- hmang chu ka chungah an ka sih a; Anni chun lei khêlinhlipin ka kuomah thu an hril a.
"They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.","Theidâna thuin a mîn huol vêl a, Ieng ni bar loin an mi do a."
For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer.,"Ka lunginsiet leiin a mi dotuhai an hung ni tah a; Nisienlakhawm, kei chu ṭawng- ṭâi dingin kân pêk tlat a."
"And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.","Anni chun thil ṭha chu thil suolin an mi thung a, Ka hmangaina chu theidanain an mi thung bawk a."
Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.,"Nangin a chungah mi suol sie la, A changtieng chun hêktu ngîr raw se."
"When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.","Rorêlpêka a um pha thiemlo changin suok sienla, A ṭawngṭâina suolnaah inchang raw se."
Let his days be few; And let another take his office.,"A dam sûng nihai chu hung tlâwm sienla, A hotu nina chu mi dangin chang raw se."
"Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.","A nauhai chu pa boin um sienla, A nuhmei chu hmeithaiin um bawk raw se;"
"Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.","A nauhai chu mi invâi hung niin kut daw sienla, An fâk ding chu an hmun hluihaia chun zawng raw se."
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.,"A pung hnawta tangka inpûk- tirtu chun a nei po po chu lâkpêk vawng sienla, Mikhuolhai chun a sininrim ra chu lâkpêk raw hai se."
Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.,"A chunga ngilneina inlangtir pei dingtu tukhawm um naw sienla, A nau, pa bohai chu lunginsiet- tu ding tukhawm um bawk naw raw se."
Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.,"A thlahai chu sukbohmangin um sienla, Ruolthar hung um nâwka chun an hming chu thai hmangin um raw se."
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.,"A thlatuhai rîtlona chu LALPA kuomah hriet zingin um sien la, A nu suolna chu thai hmangin um naw raw se."
"Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;","Chuonghai chu LALPA hmaah um naw sienla, Ama chun anni hriet zingna chu hnuoia inthawka a sukbo theina dingin."
"Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay them.","Zâinêmna inlangtir nachâng a hriet nawh a, Mi rimsi, pasie le lungriem ithlâkhai chu sukhlum tuma, a suknawmna lem hlak leiin."
"Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.","Anih, mi ṭawngse inphur hi a nuom zawng a na; chuongchun, ama chungah a hung tlung a, Mi malsâwmpêk hi a lâwm- zâwng a ni nawh a; chuong- chun, ama ihlat daiah a um a."
"He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.","Kawrfuola inthuom angin, ṭawngse inphurnain ân thuom a, Chu chu a sûngahai chun tui angin a lût a, A ruhaia chun hriek angin a lût bawk a."
"Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.","Chu chu a ta dingin ân belna hlak silfên angin um sienla, A în khit rawpna kâwngkhi ni bawk raw se."
"This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.","Chuong chu a mi dotuhai le ka hringna hrilsetuhai, LALPAIN a thungna a na."
"But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name’s sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;","Nisienlakhawm, aw Pathien LALPA, nangin i hming leiin mi thawpui la, I ngilneina chu a ṭhat leiin mi sanhim rawh."
"For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.","Rimsi le pasetak ka nih a, Ka lungril hi ka sûngah inhliemin a um bawk sih a."
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.,"Hlim botieng intung tah ang hin ka bo a, Khâuṭhikṭhi ang hin lên hmangin ka um a."
My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.,"Ka khûphai hi bu nghei leiin a hrât ta nawh a, Ka taksa hin thâu hrim a put ta nawh."
"I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.","Anni ihrilsiet ka lo ni tah a, An mi hmu phingleh an lu an thin hlak."
"Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, mi ṭhangpui la, Aw i ngilneina ang peiin mi sandam rawh."
"That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, Jehovah, hast done it.","Chu chu i kut a nih ti an hriet thei a, LALPA, nangin i thaw a nih ti an hriet theina dingin."
"Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.","Anni chun ṭawngsie inphur raw hai se, nang ruok chun malsâwm lem rawh, An tho phingleh muolpho an ta, i siehlaw ruok chu hlim a tih."
"Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.","A mi dotuhai chu inzakna puon insiltirin um hai sienla, Zakuoa intuom angin, anni muolphona chun intuom raw se."
"I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.","Ka bau hin LALPA kuomah lâwmthu nasatak hril ka ta, Anih, mipui laia chun ama chu inpâk ka tih."
"For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.","Ama chu pase changtieng chun ngîr a ta, A hringna rorêlpêktuhaia inthawka sandam dingin."
"In Jehovah do I take refuge: How say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain;","LALPAA chun ka ringna kân nghat hlak a, Iengtizieha ka hringna kuoma hin, “In tlânga chun vate angin vuong hmang ro,” in ti?"
"For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;","En ta u, lungril indiktak put inthim hnuoia an kâp theina dingin, Mi rilohai chun thalngul an kuoi a, An thal chu a hruiah an inbûk diem saw!"
"If the foundations be destroyed, What can the righteous do?","Lungphûmhai chu suksieta a um chun, Mi felin ieng am sukse thei a ta?"
"Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.","LALPA chu a biekin inthiengah a um a, LALPA chu a ṭhungpha chu vânah a um; Mihriem nauhai hi a mitin a en a, a mitvun chun a fie hlak."
Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.,LALPA chun mi fel le mi rilo chu a fie hlak a. Nunrâwngna ngaina mi chu a hringna chun a theida hlak.
Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.,"Mi rilohai chunga chun chânghai insûrtir a ta, Mei le kât le thil lumtak chu an no chan ding nîng a tih."
For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.,"LALPA chu a fel sih a, felna hi a ngaina hlak, Mi indiktakhai chun a hmêl la hmûng an tih."
"Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.","LALPA chun ka Lalpa kuomah, “I hmêlmahai i ke innghatnaa ka siem hmakhat chu, Ka changtieng ṭhung rawh,” a tih a."
Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.,LALPA chun i hrâtna hmawl chu Zion tlânga inthawkin tir suok a tih; Nangin nangma dotuhai laia chun rorêl rawh.
"Thy people offer themselves willingly In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth.","I mihai chu i thilthawtheina nia chun mâni nuomthuin an inpêk hlak a, Inthieng mawinaah, zîngkâr phîng sûnga inthawkin, I tleirâwl daidaw chu i nei a."
"Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.","LALPA chun ṭawng ân khâm a, inlêt ta naw nih, “Nang chu Melkizedek um dân anga, Chatuon Thiempu i nih ie,” tiin."
The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.,"LALPA i changtienga um chun, A lunginsen nia chun lalhai sât bawng rem rum a tih."
"He will judge among the nations, He will fill the places with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries.","Hnam tin lai chun rorêl a ta, Hmunhai chu ruongin suksip a ta, Ram tamtaka chun lu chu sât khawi rem rum a tih."
He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore will he lift up the head.,"Lampuia vadunga tui chu dâwn a ta, Chu lei chun a lu chu dawm sâng a tih."
"Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.","LALPA chu inpâk ro, Mi indiktakhai inkhâwm- naa le inrâwn khâwmnaa chun, Ka lungril po povin LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ka tih."
"The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.","LALPA thilthawhai chu a ro- pui a, A chunga lâwmhai poin zawng suok a ni hlak."
His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever.,"A sinthaw chu inza a umin a ropui a nih, A felna chu kumkhawtluonga um ding a nih."
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.,"Ama chun a thilmak thawhai chu ân hriet zingtir a, LALPA chu mi lunginsiet theitak, lainatnaa sip a nih."
He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.,"Ama ṭituhai kuoma chun fâk ding a pêk a, A thuthlung chu kumkhuoin hre zing a tih."
"He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.","A thilthawhai thilthawtheizie chu a mihai kuomah ân langtir a, Hnam tin rochan chu an kuoma pein."
The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.,"A kut thilthawhai chu thutak le rorêlna fel a na, A thununna thu po pohai chu ring a um a nih."
They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.,"Chuong chu kumkhawtluonga dingin sukdetin a um a, Thutak le indiktaka thaw a ni tâwl a."
He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name.,"Ama chun a mihai kuomah intlanna a hung tir a, A thuthlung chu kumkhuoa dingin a ruot a, A hming chu ân thiengin inza a um a nih."
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth for ever.,"LALPA ṭina chu varna bul a na, Chuong anga thaw taphawthai chun hrietthiemna ṭha an nei a. Ama inpâkna chu kumkhaw- tluonga um ding a nih."
"Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments.","LALPA chu inpâk ro, LALPA ṭi mi chu a hamṭha ie, a thupêkhaia nasataka lâwm mi chu."
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed.,"A thlahai chu hnuoia hin hrâttakin um an ta, Mi indiktakhai suonhai chu malsâwmin um an tih."
Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endureth for ever.,"A ina chun sum le hausakna a um a, A felna chu kumkhawtluonga um ding a nih."
"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.","Mi indik ta ding chun inthima chun var a hung suok a, Ama chu mi lunginsiet theitak, lainatnaa sip, feltak a nih."
Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment.,"Mi lunginsieta inpûktir hlak mi chu ṭhatin a vur hlak a, Ama chu feltakin khawsâng a tih."
For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.,"Iengtika khawm ân hnîng âwm si nawh a, Mi fel chu kumkhuoa hriet zingin um a tih."
"He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.","Chanchin ṭha nawtakhai ṭi naw nih a, LALPA chu ringin a lungril chu a det a nih."
"His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.","A lungril chu a det a, ṭi naw nih, Ama dotuhai chunga a duthusâm tlung chu a hmu hmakhat chu."
"He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted with honor.","A semdar a, pasiehai kuomah a pêk a, A felna chu kumkhuoa um ding a nih; A ki chawimawinaa chawimawiin um a tih."
"The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked shall perish.","Mi rilo chun chu chu hmûng a ta, lunginsen a tih, A ha râwt a ta, intuihmang a tih: Mi rilohai dit zâwng chu bohmang a tih."
"Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah.","LALPA chu inpâk ro. Aw LALPA siehlawhai, inpâk unla, LALPA hming chu inpâk ro."
Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.,"LALPA hming chu inpâkin um raw se, Tuta inthawka kumkhaw- tluongin."
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Jehovah’s name is to be praised.,"Nisa suoknaa inthawka a tlâk- na chenin, LALPA hming chu inpâk ding a nih."
"Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens.","LALPA chu hnam tinrênghai chunga chun chunghnung dai a na, A ropuina chun vânhai khi a khûm dai a nih."
"Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high,","LALPA ei Pathien ang tu am an um a? Chungtienga ṭhungpha neia,"
That humbleth himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth?,"Vâna thil umhai le hnuoia thil umhai en dinga, Insukhnuoi hlak ang hi tu am an um a?"
"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;","Ama chun rimsi chu pilvuta inthawk chun a keitho hlak a, Pasie chu êkthlia inthawk chun a dawm kâng hlak;"
"That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.","Mi lienhai kuoma ân umtir theina dingin, A mihai laia mi lienhai kuoma ngei chun."
"He maketh the barren woman to keep house, And to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.","Ama chun nuhmei ching chu in le lo ân vawngtir hlak a, Nau nei mi hlimtakah a siem hlak; LALPA chu inpâk ro."
"When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;","Israelhai chu Aigupta rama inthawkin an suok a, Jakob sûnghai ngei chu ṭawng dang mihai laia inthawka an suok lai khan,"
"Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.","Judahai chu ama hmun inthieng an hung ni tah a, Israelhai chu a rorêlna ram an hung ni ta bawk a."
"The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back.","Tuisuoriet chun chu chu a hmuh a, a tlân hmang a, Jordan vadung chu sukkîrin a um tah a."
"The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.","Tlâng lienhai chu berâmchalhai angin an inhnel a, Tlâng chînhai chu berâm chaltuoihai angin."
"What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?","Aw nang tuisuoriet, ieng am i tih a, i tlân hmang a na? Nang Jordan, ieng am i tih a, i kîr nâwk a na?"
"Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs?","Nangni tlâng lienhai, ieng am in tih a, berâmchalhai anga in inhnel a na? Nangni tlâng chînhai, ieng am in tih a, berâm chaltuoihai anga in inhnel a na?"
"Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,","Nang leihnuoi, LALPA hmaa chun inthin rawh, Jakobhai Pathien hmaa chun,"
"Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.","Ama chun lungpui chu dîlah ân changtir a, Meitâwklung chu tuihnârah ân changtir bawk a."
"Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, But unto thy name give glory, For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake.","Aw LALPA, keini mi pe loin, keini mi pe loin, I hming chu ropuina pe lem rawh, I ngilneina le i thutak leiin."
"Wherefore should the nations say, Where is now their God?","Iengdinga hnam tinin, “Khâwlai am an Pathien kha teh?” an ti am a na?"
But our God is in the heavens: He hath done whatsoever he pleased.,"Kan Pathien chu vânah a um sih a, A nuom taphawt a thaw a nih."
"Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.","An milimhai chu tangka le rângkachak an na, Mihriem kutsuok an nih."
"They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;","Bauhai an nei a, an ṭawng thei si nawh, Mithai an nei a, an hmu thei si nawh."
"They have ears, but they hear not; Noses have they, but they smell not;","Nahai an nei a, an hriet thei si nawh, Hnârhai an nei a, rim an hriet thei si nawh."
"They have hands, but they handle not; Feet have they, but they walk not; Neither speak they through their throat.","Kuthai an nei a, iengkhawm an tâwk thei si nawh. Kehai an nei a, an lâwn thei si nawh a, An hnukin an ṭawng thei si nawh."
"They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.","Chuong siemtuhai chu chuong ang bawk chun um an ta, Anih, chuong ringtu taphawthai chu."
"O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.","Aw Israelhai, LALPA chu ring ro, Ama chu anni ṭhangpuitu le an phaw a nih."
"O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.","Aw Aron sûnghai, LALPA chu ring ro, Ama chu anni ṭhangpuitu le an phaw a nih."
"Ye that fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.","LALPA ṭituhai, LALPA chu ring ro, Ama chu anni ṭhangpuitu le an phaw a nih."
Jehovah hath been mindful of us; he will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.,"LALPA chun a mi hriet zing a, mal mi sâwm a tih, Israel sûnghai chu mal sâwm a ta, Aron sûnghai chu mal sâwm a tih."
"He will bless them that fear Jehovah, Both small and great.","LALPA ṭituhai chu mal sâwm a ta, A lien a chînin."
"Jehovah increase you more and more, You and your children.","LALPA chun sukpung deu deu raw se cheu, Nangni le in nauhai leh."
"Blessed are ye of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.","LALPA chun mal sâwm raw se cheu, Ama chu hnuoi le vân siemtu a nih."
The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah; But the earth hath he given to the children of men.,"Vânhai khi LALPA vânhai a na, Leihnuoi ruok hi chu mihriem nauhai kuomah a pêk a nih."
"The dead praise not Jehovah, Neither any that go down into silence;","Mithihai chun LALPA chu an inpâk nawh a, Hmun retaka zu fehai hrim hrim chun an inpâk bawk nawh."
But we will bless Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye Jehovah.,"Eini ruok chun LALPA chu inpâk tâng ei tih, Tuta inthawka kumkhaw- tluongin. LALPA chu inpâk ro."
"I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications.","LALPA chu ka hmangai a nih, ka râwl le Lunginsiet ka hninahai chu a ngai leiin."
"Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.","Keia tieng a na a hung sit leiin, Ka dam sûng po po chun ama chu ko ka tih."
"The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.","Thina hruihruolhai chun an mi zem a, Seol natnahai chun a mi man a, Lunginzîngna le lungngaina ka tuok a."
"Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.","Chu phingle chun LALPA hming chu ka ko a, “Aw LALPA, lunginsiettakin ka hringna hi sanhim rawh,” tiin."
"Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful.","LALPA chu mi lunginsietthei le feltak a na, Anih, ei Pathien chu mi lainattheitak a nih."
"Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.","LALPA chun mimâwlhai chu a humhim hlak a, Sukhnuoiin ka um a, ama chun a mi sandam tah a,"
"Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.","Aw ka hringna, i châwlnaa chun kîr nâwk rawh, LALPA chun i chungah ṭhatakin a thaw ta sih a."
"For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling.","Ka hringna hi thinaa inthawkin, Ka mithai hi mitthlia inthawkin, Ka kehai hi tlûknaa inthawk chun i sanhim sih a."
I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living.,"Mi hring rama hin, LALPA hmaah lêng ka tih."
"I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted:","Ka ring a, thu ka hril ding a ni hi, Nasataka sukrinumin ka um kha."
"I said in my haste, All men are liars.","Ka hamhaiin, “Mi po po khêl an nih,” ka lo ti tah a."
What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me?,"Ka chunga a thil thaw ṭhat po po hi, LALPA kuomah ieng am pe ve thung ka ta aw?"
"I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah.","Sandamna no lâng ka ta, LALPA hming chu ko ka tih."
"I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people.","Ka thutiemhai chu LALPA kuomah hlen ka ta, Anih, a mihai po po hmaa chun."
Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints.,"A mi inthienghai thina chu, LALPA ngai chun hlutak a nih."
"O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds.","Aw LALPA, i siehlaw ka ni tak zet el, I siehlaw i suoknu naupa chu ka na, Khuopa ka umnahai chu i mi sût tah a."
"I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah.","Lâwmthuhril inthawinahai chu inhlân ka ti cheh a, LALPA hming chu ko ka tih."
"I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people,","Ka thutiemhai chu LALPA kuomah hlen ka ta; Anih, a mihai po po hmaa chun,"
"In the courts of Jehovah’s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.","LALPA biekin inhuonna sûng tuollaiah, Aw Jerusalem, i laitaka chun. LALPA chu inpâk ro."
"O praise Jehovah, all ye nations; Laud him, all ye peoples.","Aw hnam tinrênghai, LALPA chu inpâk unla, Mi tinrênghai, ama chu inpâk ro."
For his lovingkindness is great toward us; And the truth of Jehovah endureth for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.,"A ngilneina chu ei chungah a nasain, LALPA thutak chu kumkhaw- tluongin a um ding a ni sih a. LALPA chu inpâk ro."
Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.,"Aw, LALPA kuoma lâwmthu hril ro, ama chu a ṭha sih a, A ngilneina khawm kumkhawtluongin a um ding a ni sih a;"
"Let Israel now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","A ngilneina chu kumkhawtluongin a um ding a nih ti, Israelhai chun hril raw hai se."
"Let the house of Aaron now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","A ngilneina chu kumkhawtluongin a um ding a nih ti, Aron sûnghai chun hril raw hai se."
"Let them now that fear Jehovah say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","A ngilneina chu kumkhaw- tluongin a um ding a nih ti, LALPA ṭituhai chun hril raw hai se."
Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah: Jehovah answered me and set me in a large place.,"Ka lunginzîngnaa inthawkin, LALPA chu ka ko a, LALPA chun a mi dawn a, hmun inthâwl takah a mîn umtir tah a."
Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear: What can man do unto me?,"LALPA chu keia tienga ṭhang a nih, ṭi naw ning: Mihriemin ieng am mi law thei an ta?"
Jehovah is on my side among them that help me: Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.,"LALPA chu keia tienga ṭhang, a mi ṭhangpuituhai laia mi a nih, Chuleiin, a mi theidatuhai chunga ka duthusâm chu hmûng ka tih."
It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in man.,Mihriem ring nêk chun LALPAA ringna innghat hi a ṭha lem a nih.
It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in princes.,"Lalhai ring nêk chun, LALPAA ringna innghat hi a ṭha lem a nih."
All nations compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.,"Hnam tinrêngin an mîn huol vêl a, Anni chu LALPA hmingin sukbohmang ka tih."
"They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.","Anni chun an mîn huol vêl a, anih, an mîn huolvêl a, Anni chu LALPA hmingin sukbohmang ka tih."
They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.,"Khuoihai angin an mîn huol vêl a, hling chawk anga sukrêmin an um a, Anni chu LALPA hmingin sukbohmang ka tih."
Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; But Jehovah helped me.,"Ka tlûkna dingin natakin i mi sun ngei a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun a mi ṭhangpui ta hlau a,"
Jehovah is my strength and song; And he is become my salvation.,"LALPA chu ka hrâtna le ka hla a nih, A mi sandamtu a lo ni ta bawk a:"
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.,"Lâwmna le sandamna ri chu mi felhai puon inah a um hlak a, LALPA kut changtieng chun huoitakin a thaw hlak."
The right hand of Jehovah is exalted: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.,"LALPA kut changtieng chu chawimawiin a um hlak a, LALPA kut changtieng chun huoitakin a thaw hlak."
"I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of Jehovah.","Thi naw ning a, dam ka ta, LALPA thilthawhai chu inhriettir lem ka tih."
Jehovah hath chastened me sore; But he hath not given me over unto death.,"LALPA chun nasatakin a mi thunun a, Thina kuoma ruok chun a mi pêk êm nawh."
"Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah.","Felna kul kawtkhârhai hi mi hawngpêk unla, Hienga hin lût ka ta, LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ka tih."
This is the gate of Jehovah; The righteous shall enter into it.,Hi hi LALPA kawtkhâr a nih. Mi felhai chu lût an tih.
"I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me, And art become my salvation.","I kuomah lâwmthu hril ka tih, nangin i mi dawnin, A mi sandamtu i lo ni ta sih a."

Their heart is as fat as grease; But I delight in thy law.,"An lungril chu rîlrâng thau angin a thau a, Kei ruok chu i dân chungah ka lâwm hlak."
It is good for me that I have been afflicted; That I may learn thy statutes.,"I thuruothai chu kân chûk thiem theina dinga, Sukrinuma ka lo um kha ka ta dingin a ṭha a nih."

"The proud have digged pits for me, Who are not according to thy law.","Mi chapo, i dân anga um nawhai chun, Ka tlâkna dingin khurhai an cho a."

Thou art my hiding-place and my shield: I hope in thy word.,"Nang chu kân bîkhmangna le ka phaw i na, I thu ka beisei a nih."

My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; And I am afraid of thy judgments. ע AYIN.,"Ka tisa hi nangma ṭîin ân thin a, I rorêlnahai chu ka ṭî bawk a."
I have done justice and righteousness: Leave me not to mine oppressors.,"Ro ka rêl a, feltakin ka thaw hlak a nih, A mi nêksâwrtuhaia inthawkin mi thlathlam naw rawh."
Be surety for thy servant for good: Let not the proud oppress me.,"I siehlaw chungchâng thuah, a ṭhatna dingin a bul tum la, Chapohaiin mi nêksâwr naw raw se."

And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.,"Chuongchun, ama chun Israelhai chu, An rîtlona po poa inthawkin sansuok a tih."
"Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me.","LALPA, ka lungril hi a chapo nawh a, ka mithai hi ân sâng bawk nawh; Thil ropuitakhaiah ka ṭhangsa ve ngai nawh, Ka ta dinga thilmak taluohaia khawm."

"Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, Nor go up into my bed;","“Ka umna inah lût dêr naw ning a, Ka khumah kai bawk naw ning a."
"I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Or slumber to mine eyelids;","Ka mithai hi insîm phal naw ning a, Ka mit vunhai hi insîm phal bawk naw ning ah."
"Until I find out a place for Jehovah, A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.","LALPA hmun ding ka zawng suok hmakhat chun, Jakob Mi Hrât umna ding chu,” tiin."
"Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: We found it in the field of the wood.","Ngai ta, a thu chu Ephrathaah kan hriet a, Rampui phûla chun kan hmu tah a."
We will go into his tabernacles; We will worship at his footstool.,"Ama umnaahai chun lût ei ta, A ke innghatna bula chun chibai bûk ei tih."
"Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of thy strength.","Aw LALPA, tho la, i châwl hmun dinga chun lût rawh, Nang le i hrâtna bâwm leh."
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; And let thy saints shout for joy.,"I thiempuhai chu felnain inthuom sienla, I mi inthienghai chu hlimin khêk raw hai se."
For thy servant David’s sake Turn not away the face of thine anointed.,"I siehlaw David leiin, I hriek nâl hmêl chu innghat kîrtir naw rawh."
Jehovah hath sworn unto David in truth; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.,"LALPA chun David kuomah thutakin ṭawng ân khâm tah a, Chu chu nghatsan naw nih. “I taksa raa mi i lalṭhungphaa chun inṭhungtir ka ta;"

For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for his habitation.,LALPA chun Zion chu a thlang sih a; A umna dingin a dit a nih.
This is my resting-place for ever: Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.,"“Hi hi kumkhuoa dinga ka châwl hmun ding a nih, Hitaka hin um zing ka tih, ka nuom zâwng a ni sih a."
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.,"A fâk ding chu malsâwm rei rui ka ta, A mi rimsihai chu beiin sukkhawp ka tih."
Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.,"A thiempuhai chu sandamnain inthuom ka ta, A mi inthienghai chu hlimin khêk khêk an tih."
There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.,"Chutaka chun David ki chu inder suoktir ka ta, Ka hriek nâl ta ding chun khâwnvar ka ruot tah a."
His enemies will I clothe with shame; But upon himself shall his crown flourish.,"Ama dotuhai chu muolphonain inthuom ka ta, Ama chunga ruok chun a lallu- khum chu tle sur a tih,” tiin."
"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!","Ngai ta, unauhai inngei diel diela um khâwm hi, A va ṭhain, a vân hawi de!"

For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother’s womb.,"Nangma ngeiin ka lungril i nei a, Ka nu phîng sûngah i mîn khum a."
I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well.,"I kuomah lâwmthu hril ka ti che, ṭiumtak le maktaka siem ka ni sih a, I thilthawhai hi maktak a na, Chu chu ka hringna hin a hriet chieng hle a nih."

"For they speak against thee wickedly, And thine enemies take thy name in vain.","Anni chun suoltakin an hrilsiet si cheh a, Nangma dotuhai chun i hming chu an hril nawmna hlak."

I hate them with perfect hatred: They are become mine enemies.,"Anni chu theida taktêin ka theidah a, A mi dotuhaiah ka ruot tâwl a."
"Search me, O God, and know my heart: Try me, and know my thoughts;","Aw Pathien, nguntakin mi en suok la, ka lungril hi hre rawh, Mi fie la, ka ngaituonahai hi hre rawh."
"And see if there be any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.","Chun, keimaa hin rîtlona kawng hrim hrim a um le a um naw en la, Chatuon lampuia chun mi ṭhuoi rawh."
"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.","Mi invêt chun a lungrilin, “Pathien hrim a um nawh,” a ti hlak a. An se zo a, thil ṭha thaw hrim an um nawh."

"They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.","Anaw tieng an lo pêt vawng tah a, pawrchetakin an lo um ta vawng a, Tukhawm thil ṭha thaw hrim an um nawh, pakhat bêk khawm an um dêr nawh."

There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.,"Chutaka chun ṭi bêk bêkin an um a, Pathien chu mi fel thlahai lai chun a um hlak leiin."
"Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.","Mi rimsi remruot chu in sukmuolpho hlak a, LALPA chu ân humhimna a ni leiin."
"Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.","Israelhai sandamna chu Ziona inthawkin hung suok sienla chu aw!

"Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; Preserve me from the violent man:","Aw LALPA, mi suola inthawk chun mi sanhim la, Mi nunrâwnga inthawk chun mi humhim rawh."
Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually do they gather themselves together for war.,"Anni chun an lungrilah thil suk- suolhai an ngaituo hlak a, Do dingin an inkhâwm rawp hlak."
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Adders’ poison is under their lips. [Selah,"An lei chu rûl angin an suk- ngei a, An hner sûnga chun rûlriel tûr a um a."
"Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.","Aw LALPA, mi rilo kuta in- thawk chun mi vawng ṭha la, Mi nunrâwnga inthawk chun mi humhim rawh; Anni chun ka ke pênhai hi nam kâwi an tum a."
"The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me. [Selah","Mi chapohai chun ka âwkna dingin châng an kam rûk a, hruihruolhai leh; Lampui sîra chun lên an phah a, Ka âwkna dingin chânghai an kam a."
"I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God: Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.","LALPA kuoma chun, “Nang chu ka Pathien i na, Aw LALPA, lunginsiet ka hnina râwlhai hi lo ngaisak rawh."
"O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka san- damtu hrât, Nang chun indo nia chun ka lu i mîn khumpêk a;"
"Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves. [Selah","Aw LALPA, mi rilo dit zâwng- hai chu phal naw la, An ngaituona suol chu inpui- tlingtir naw rawh; Chuong naw chun inchawimawi rawi an tih,” ka tih a."
"As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.","A mîn huolvêltuhai lu chu, Anni hmûra an thu suol hril chun inkhum raw se."
"Let burning coals fall upon them: Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.","Meilinghai an chungah tla sienla, Meia peiin um hai sienla, An tho nâwk ta nawna dingin khur inthûktakah peiin um raw se."
An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.,"Thu ṭha naw hriltu chu hnuoia hin sukdetin um naw nih a, Mi nunrâwng sukse dingin thil ṭha nawin tlâkbuok a tih."
"I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy.","LALPA chun rinum tuorhai chu an thuah ṭan a tih ti ka hriet, Pasiehai chu an ta dinga âwm hrima leh."
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.,"Matheiloin mi felhai chun i hming inpâk an ta, Mi indikhai chu i hmaah um an tih."
"Jehovah, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.","LALPA, ka ko che hi, ka kuomah hung vak la, Ka ko chein ka râwlah i nâ lo sit rawh."
Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.,"Ka ṭawngṭâina hi thil riminhniktak angin i hmaah suksuokin um sienla, Ka kut phar hi zântienga inthawina angin um raw se."
"Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips.","Aw LALPA, ka bau bula hin vêngtu inhungtir la, Ka hmûr kawtkhâr hi vêng rawh."
"Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties.","Rîtlona thilhai, Thil suksuol mihai thawpui dingin, Ka lungril hi thil ṭha naw tieng hrim hrima chun inthlêktir naw la, An fâk inhniktak takhai chu mîn fâktir bawk naw rawh."
"Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.","Mi fel chun mi vaw raw se, lunginsietna nîng a tih; Mi kâwk raw se, lua hriek nâl ang nîng a tih. Ka luin nuom naw naw raw se, An rîtlonahai leiin ka ṭawngṭai pei ding a ni sih a."
Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.,"An rorêltuhai chu lungpui sîra peithlâkin um an ta, Anni chun ka thuhai chu ngai tâng an ta, a thlum sih a."
"As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.","Miin hnuoi ân let a, a suknâwi ang hin, An ruhai hi thlân khoa suknâwiin a um a."
"For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.","Aw LALPA PATHIEN, ka mitin nanga tieng a en si hlak a, Nangmaa chun ka ringna kân nghat hlak; ka hringna hi saruokin mâksan naw rawh."
"Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.","Ka âwkna dinga châng an kama inthawk chun mi humhim la, Thil suksuoltuhai chânga inthawk leh."
"Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst that I withal escape.","Keiin ka fe khêl laitakin, Mi rilohai chu anni lênahai chun tlulût raw se."
I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication.,"Ka râwlin LALPA chu ka ko a, Ka râwlin LALPA kuomah lunginsietna ka hni hlak."
I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble.,"A hmaah ka lunginzîng thu ka hril a, A hmaah ka buoina kân hriettir hlak."
"When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me.","Ka thlarau ka sûnga a châu lai khan, nangma ngeiin ka lampui chu i hriet a; Ka fena lampuia hin ka âwk- na dingin châng an kam inrûk a."
"Look on my right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul.","Ka changtieng hi thlêk la, en ta, tukhawm a mi hre hrim hrim an um ta naw hi; Kân humhimna a um ta nawh a, tukhawmin ka hringna hi an ngaisak ta nawh."
"I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.","Aw LALPA, ka ko cheh a, “Nang chu kân humhimna, Mi hring rama ka chanvo i nih,” ka tih a."
Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.,"Ka khêk ri hi lo ngai la, nasataka sukhnuoiin ka um ta sih a, A mi suknawmnatuhaia inthawk hin mi sanhim la, keia nêkin an hrât lem sih a."
"Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.","I hming kân pâk theina dingin ka hringna hi intângna ina inthawkin ṭhuoi suok la, Mi felhai chun mîn huol vêl an ta; Nangin ṭhataka i mi thaw ding a ni leiin."

And enter not into judgment with thy servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous.,"I siehlaw chunga hin rorêl naw la, I mithmua chun mihring hrim hrim thiem chang an um âwm si nawh a."
"For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.","Dotu chun ka hringna a suknawmna sih a, Ka hringna hi hnuoiah a vuok thlûk a; Thi ta daihai angin hmun inthimtakahai a mîn umtir a."

Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.,"Ama chu a nih, lalhai kuoma sandamna pe a, Kâwlhnâm mi sukkhawlotheia inthawka a siehlaw David sansuoktu chu."
"Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.","Mi sansuok la, mikhuolhai kuta inthawkin mi sanhim rawh, An bau chun thu teplo mei mei an hril hlak; An kut changtieng chu kut changtieng indik naw a nih."

"I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.","Aw Pathien, ka ko hlak cheh a, nangin i mi dawn âwm sih a, Keia tieng hin i na hung sit la, ka thu hril hi ngai rawh."
"Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee From those that rise up against them.",Aw nangmaa ringna innghattu taphawt anni thawtuhaia inthawka i kut changtienga sandam hlaktu. I ngilneizie maktak chu inlangtir rawh.
"Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,","Mit nautê angin mi kawl ṭha la, I thla hnuoiahai chun mi thup rawh,"
"From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about.","Mi rilo mi suksetu, Thipui thei ka hmêlmahai, a min huol vêl tlattuhaia inthawk hin."
They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly.,"Anni chu anni thâu vêka inhuonin an um a, An bauin chapotakin an ṭawng hlak."
They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.,"Tuhin chu kan kalchawina taphawtah an mîn huol vêl tah a, Hnuoia mi sukthlu dingin an mithai chu kan chungah an infûktir zing a."
"He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.","Ama chu sakeibaknei sa se inhâwktak ang le, Sakeibaknei vânglai, hmun fienrielhaia bawk zing ang chu a nih."
"Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;","Aw LALPA, tho la, ama chu hmasawn la, inkûntir tlat rawh, Ka hringna hi mi rilohaia inthawk chun i kâwlhnâmin sanhim la,"
"From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.","Aw LALPA, i kutin mihriem- haia inthawkin, Khawvêl mihriemhaia inthawk hin sanhim la, Anni chanvo chu hi dam sûnga an nei hi a na, An phîng chu i roin i suksippêk hlak a; Nauhai lungawi tâwk zetin an nei a, An sum hmang mahla chu an nautesenhai an thisanpêk hlak."
"As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.","Kei ruok chun felna neiin i hmêl hmûng ka ta, Nanga angna neia ka meng pha chun lungawi tâwk zet tâng ka tih."
"I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.","Aw LALPA ka hrâtna, ka hmangai che."
"Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.","LALPA chu ka lungpui le, ka kulpui le a mi sanhimtu a nih; Ka Pathien, ka lungpui dettak a nih, amaa chun ka ringna innghat ka tih; Ka phaw le, ka sandamna ki le, ka kulbîng insâng a nih."
"I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.","Inpâktlâk LALPA chu ko ka ta, Chuongchun, a mi dotuhaia inthawkin sanhimin um ka tih."
"The cords of death compassed me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.","Thina hruihruolhai chun a mi zem a, Pathien ngaisak nawna tuilienhai chun a mi sukṭi bawk a."
The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.,"Seol hruihruolhai chun a mi khuop tlat a, Thina chânghai chun a mi âwk a;"
"In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.","Ka lunginzîngin LALPA chu ka ko hlak a, Ka Pathien ka ko hlak; Ama chun a biekina inthawk chun ka râwl chu a hriet a, A hmaha ka khêkri chu a naah a lût tah a."
"Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.","Chu phingle chun hnuoi hi ân hnîng a, ân thin tah a, A lunginsen leiin tlânghai khawm chu, Ân nghatna pumin ân thinin ân hnîng tah a."
"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.","A hnâra inthawk chu meikhu ân tung ta ngut ngut a, A baua suok mei chun a kâng ta dur dur a; Chu chun meihawl khawm chu a sukchawk ta hum hum a."
"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.","Ama chun vânhai khawm chu ân kûntir a, a ṭum tah a. A ke hnuoia chun inthim sâmup hi a hung um tah a."
"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.","Cherub chungah a chuong a, a vuong tah a; Anih, thli thlaahai chun a vuong thuok thuok a."
"He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.","Inthim hi ân bîkhmangna hmunah, ama inhuol vêlna bûktêah a siem a, Tuia inthimna vâna sûm sâmuphai chu."
"At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.","A hmaa vara inthawk chun a sûm sâmuphai chu an inkieng a, Ṭêk le rielhai chu a tla ta ur ur a"
"Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.","LALPA chu vânahai khin ân ri ta dur dur bawk a, Achunghnungtak chun a râwl ân suoh a, Rielso le ṭêk mei inhlap ri ân ri rum rum a"
"And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.","Chun, a thalhai chu a kâp suok a, anni chu a sukdar a, Anih, kâwlhai ân leptir zawt zawt zing a, a sukbuoi tâwl tah a."
"Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.","Chu phingleh, Aw LALPA, i kâwkna leiin, I hnâra inthuok suok chun a mût rak leiin, Tui luongnahai chu a hung inlang a; Leilung innghatna chu suklangin a um tah a."
"He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.","Ama chun chungtienga inthawkin a hung ban a, a mi chel a; Tui tamtaka inthawk chu a mi kei suok tah a."
"He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.",A mi dotu hrâttaka inthawk chun a mi sanhim tah a; A mi theidatuhaia inthawk khawmin; Keia ta ding chun an hrât talaw sih a.
They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.,"Anni chun ka vângduoi ni chun an mi thawh a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu ka sawng tak a nih."
"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.","Ama chun hmun inthâwltakah a mi ṭhuoi suok a, Ka chungah a lâwm leiin a mi lo sanhim tah a nih."
Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.,"LALPA chun ka felzie ang ngeiin ka chungah a thawh a, Ka kuthai ân thieng ang ngeiin a mi thung a nih."
"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.","LALPA lampuihai chu ka hrawh a, Ka Pathien kuoma inthawkin rilotakin ka fe hmang ngai si nawh a."
"For all his ordinances were before me, And I put not away his statutes from me.","A dânhai po po ka hmaah a um hlak a, A thuruothai chu ka pei ngai si nawh a."
"I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity.","Ama kuoma chun demkailo ka lo na, Ka khawhlonaa inthawk chun kân siekieng hlak."
"Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun ka felzie ang peiin a mi thung tah a, Ka kuthai a mithmuah ân thieng ang peiin."
With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;,"Mi lunginsietthei tak kuoma chun lunginsietthei takin insuklang i ta, Mi ṭha famkim kuoma chun ṭha famkimin insuklang i tih."
With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.,"Mi inthieng kuoma chun inthiengin insuklang i ta, Chun, mi kâwmaw kuoma chun kâwmaw takin insuklang i tih."
For thou wilt save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.,"Rinum tuor mihai chu i sandam ding a ni sih a, Mi chapohai ruok chu suktlâwm i tih."
For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.,"Nangin ka khâwnvar hi i mi sitpêk ding a ni sih a, LALPA ka Pathien chun kân thimna hi sukvar a tih."
For by thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I leap over a wall.,"Nangma iṭhangpuiin, râl ka baw sih a, Ka Pathien ṭhangpui bawkin kul bang chu châwm hlîm ka tih."
"As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.","Pathien chu a lampui chu a ṭhafamkim a, LALPA thu chu fie a ni tah a, Amaha ringna innghattuhai po po ta ding chun ama chu phaw a nih."
"For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,",LALPA naw chu tu am Pathien a um a? Ei Pathien naw chu tu am lungpui a um a?
"The God that girdeth me with strength, And maketh my way perfect?","Hrâtnaa ka tâia mi khittu le, Ka lampui sukṭha famkimtu Pathien chu."
He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: And setteth me upon my high places.,"Ama chun ka ke hi sazukpui ke angin a siem a, Ka hmun insângtakahai a min umtir hlak a."
He teacheth my hands to war; So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.,"Ka kuthai hi râl kâp dingin ân chûktir hlak a, Chuongchun, ka bânhai hin dâr thalngul a kuoi zo hiel a."
"Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great.","Nangin i sandamna phaw chu i mi pêk bawk a: I kut changtiengin i mi kei a, I inngaitlâwmna chun a mi siem lien tah a."
"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.","Ka hnuoia ka kalchawina chu i suklien a, Chuongchun, ka kehai hi ân tleu nawh."
"I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.","A mi dotuhai chu hnawt ka ta, hnawt phâk el ka tih, Sukbohmanga an um hmakhat chun nghakîr ta naw bawk ka tih."
"I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise: They shall fall under my feet.","An tho nâwk thei nawna dingin sât sawk ka ta, Ka ke hnuoia hin tlu tâwl an tih."
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.,"Nangin inthawnaa ding chun hrâtnain ka tâiah i mi khit a, A mi hung thawtuhai chu ka hnuoiah i suktlâwm tah a."
"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.","A mitheidatuhai chu ka sukbohmang theina dingin, Nangin a mi dotuhai chu hnung mîn nghatin în umtir ta bawk a."
"They cried, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.","Anni chu an khêk a, nisienla- khawm, sandamtu ding tukhawm an um si nawh, LALPA ngei chu an ko va, nisienlakhawm, a dawn si nawh."
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.,"Chu phingleh, pilvut thli ilên ang el hin ka vuok nâwi neng a, Tuollaia chirhak ang el hin ka peihâwn tah a."
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.,"Nangin mihai insuolnaa inthawk chun i mi sanhim tah a, Hnam tinhai lua chun i mi siem tah a. Ka hriet ngailo mihai chun ka rawng bâwl tâng an tih."
As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.,"Ka chanchin an hriet phingleh ka thu awi an ta, Hmêlmak mihai chu ka kuomah intuklût an tih."
"The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.","Hmêlmak mihai chu hung zuoi an ta, An kulbînga inthawk chun inthin pumin hung suok an tih."
"Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,","LALPA chu a hring zing a, ka lungpui chu inpâkin um raw se, A mi sandamtu Pathien chu chawimawiin um raw se."
"Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me.","Phuba mi lapêktu le, Mi tin ka hnuoia suktlâwmtu Pathien ngei chu."
"He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.","Ama chun a mi dotuhaia in- thawk chun a mi sansuok a, Anih, nangin a mi thawtuhai chungtieng chun i mi dawm kâng a, Mi nunrâwnga inthawk chun i mi sanhim hlak."
"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA, hnam tin lai chun lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, I hming inpâkin hla sak bawk ka tih."
"Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.","Ama chun hnena ropuitak a lal siem kuoma chun a pêk hlak a, A hrieknâl chungah, David le a thlahai chung ngeia chun, Kumkhawtluongin a ngilneizie inlangtir a tih."
The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork.,"Vânhai khin Pathien ropuizie chu ân hriettir a, Boruok lientak khin a kutsuok chu ân langtir hlak a."
"Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge.","Sûn hin sûn kuomah thu a hril sâwng pei a, Zânin zân kuomah hrietna ân lang sâwngtir pei hlak."
There is no speech nor language; Their voice is not heard.,"Thuhril hrim hrim le ṭawng hrim hrim a um nawh a, An râwl chu naa hriet thei a ni nawh."
"Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,","An inkhina hrui po po chu hnuoi chung po poa keimarin a um a, An thu chu kâwlkawdawng chenin ân thang suok tah a. Chuonghaia chun nisa ta ding khin puon in a kei a,"
"Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.","Chu nisa chu moneitu ding a pindana inthawka suok ang a nih, Mi hrâttak angin a tlânna lampuia tlân ding chu a hlim hlak."
"His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.","A suokna chu kâwlkawdawng tawpa inthawkin a na, A tlân kuolna chu a tâwp khingtieng chen a nih; A lumna chu hre lo dinga thuphmang hrim hrim a um nawh."
"The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.","LALPA dân chu a ṭha famkim a, hringna a siemṭha hlak, LALPA thu inhriettir chu ring a um a, mi mâwl a sukvar hlak."
"The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes.","LALPA thununna thu chu ân dik a, lungril a suklâwm hlak, LALPA thupêk chu ân thieng a, mithai a sukvar hlak."
"The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether.","LALPA ṭina chu a fai a, kumkhuo a dai hlak, LALPA rorêlna chu ân dik a, a fel vêl vawng a nih."
"More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.","Chuong chu rângkachak nêka ditum a na; anih, rângkachak inthieng tamtak nêk khawmin. Khuoizu le khuoithlâr nêk khawmin a thlum lem bawk a nih."
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward.,Chu nawa khawm chuong thuhai chun i siehlaw hi vaulâwkin ka um hlak a. Chuong zâwm chu lâwmman nasatak neina a ni hlak.
Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.,Tuin am mâni suksuolhai hre thei a ta? Suol inthuphaia inthawk hin mi sukkieng rawh.
"Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression.","Thil suksuol ngainaw dingin i siehlaw hi mi chel la, Ka chungah anni chu thu inneitir naw la; chuongchun, ṭha famkimin um ka tih. Bawsietna nasataka inthawkin demkailoin um ka tih."
"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.","Aw LALPA ka lungpui le a mîn tlantu, Ka baua thu suokhai le ka lungrila ngaituonahai hi i mithmuah lâwmtlâkin um raw se."
"Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?","Hnamhai chu iengdinga an lunginsen a, Mihai chun iengdinga thil teplo an ngaituo am a na?"
"The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,","Hnuoia lalhaiin an ep huoi huoi a, Hotuhai khawm an inrâwn khâwm a, LALPA le a hrieknâl chunga chun:"
"Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.","“An khuopnahai hi suktanin, An hruihruolhai hi ei kuoma inthawkin pei dai ei tiu,” tiin."
He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.,Vâna ṭhungpa chu innui a ta: LALPA chun anni chu nuisan a tih.
"Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:","Chu hnunga chun a lunginsenin an kuomah thu hril a ta, Lunginsentakin anni chu suklungzîng tâng a tih."
Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.,"“Keima ngeiin ka tlâng inthieng Ziona chun, Ka lal siem chu kân ṭhungtir tah a nih” a tih a."
"I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.","Thuruot chu ka hril ding a nih: LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Nang chu ka naupa i nih; Vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih."
"Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.","Mi hni rawh, chuongchun, i rohluo dingin hnam tin pêng ka ti cheh a: Kâwlkil tâwp chenin i ro dingin pe bawk ka ti che."
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.,"Anni chu thîr hmawlin sukkawi i ta, Bêlhemtu bêl angin anni chu pei nâwi i tih,” a tih a."
"Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.","Chuongchun, aw lalhai, var ta unla, Hnuoia rorêltuhai inchûktirin um ro."
"Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.","Ṭi pumin LALPA rawng bâwl unla, Inthin pumin lâwm ro;"
"Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.","Naupa chu fâwp ro, chuong naw chun lunginsen a ta, lam kârah bohmang rawi in tih: A lungsen chu a hung inthawk phut ding a ni sih a. Amaa an ringna innghattuhai po po chu an hamṭha."
Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;,"Lunginzing ni chun LALPA- IN dawn raw se che, Jakob Pathien hming chun hmun insângah dawm kai raw se che;"
"Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion;","Hmun inthienga inthawk chun ṭhangpuina tirpêk sienla che, Ziona inthawk chun sukhrât raw se che."
"Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; [Selah","I thilinhlân po po chu hre zing sienla, I pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu lâwm raw se."
"Grant thee thy heart’s desire, And fulfil all thy counsel.","I lungril dit zâwng chu pe phal sienla che, I remruot po po chu inhlawtlingtir raw se che."
"We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions.","I sandamnaa chun hlimin hla sak ka ta, Ei Pathien hmingin ei puonzâr- hai hi la zâr ei tih: LALPA chun i hnina po po inhlawtlingtir raw se che."
Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand.,"LALPAIN a hrieknâl hi a sandam ti tuhin ka hriet tah a, A kut changtieng sandamna thain, A vân inthienga inthawk khin ama la dawn a tih."
"Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.","Ṭhenkhatin tawlailîrhai an ring a, ṭhenkhatin sakawrhai an ring a, Keini ruok chun LALPA kan Pathien hming chu lam lem kan tih."
"They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright.","Anni chu an kûn a, an tlu tah a, Keini ruok chu kan tho a, kan ngîr tlûn ta lem a,"
"Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call.","LALPA, sandam rawh, Kan ko pha chun Laltak chun mi dawn raw se."
"The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!","Aw LALPA, lal chu i hrâtnaa hin hlim a ta, I sandamnaa hin a va hlim nasa âwm de;"
"Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips. [Selah","A lungril dit zâwng chu i pêk a, A hmûra a thil hni chu i phal naw nawh a."
For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.,"Ṭhatnaa malsâwmnahaiin i tuok a, Rângkachak inthieng lallukhum în khumtir sih a."
"He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever.","Ama chun hringna a hni cheh a, i lo pêk a, Kumkhawtluonga dam zingna chu."
His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.,"I sandamnaa chun a ropuina chu a nasa a nih, Chawimawina le ropuina a chungah în nghat hlak a."
For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.,"Kumkhuoa dingin malsâwmna nasatak dawngin i siem sih a, I hmaah hlimnain i suklâwm hlak."
For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.,"Lal chun LALPA chu a ring sih a, Achunghnungtak ngilneina leiin inhnîng naw ni."
Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee.,"I kutin nanga dotu po pohai che chu zawng suok i ta, I kut changtieng chun nangma theidatuhai che chu zawng suok a tih."
"Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them.","I lungsen pha chun anni chu rawtuina mei chawk zur zur ang chun siem i ta, LALPA chun anni chu lunginsenin lem zo a ta, Mei chun kâng hmang el a tih."
"Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men.","An rahai chu hnuoia inthawk chun sukbo i ta, An thlahai chu mihriem nauhai laia inthawkin sukbohmang bawk i tih."
For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.,"I chunga khan thil suol thaw an tum sih a, Thil suol an ngaituo suok a, an thaw thei si nawh."
For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.,"Nangin anni chu în hnung- sawntir ding a ni sih a, I thalhruihai chu an hmai tinin kuoisa diem i tih,"
"Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.","Aw LALPA, i hrâtnaa chun chawimawiin um la, Chuongchun, i thilthawtheina inpâkin hla sak kan tih."
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?","Ka Pathien, ka Pathien, iengdinga i mi mâksan am? Iengdinga mi ṭhangpui dinga i hlat hleh a, kân rûmna thuhaia inthawka i hla am a na?"
"O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent.","Aw ka Pathien, sûnah ka khêk a; nisienlakhawm, i dawn si nawh, Zânah ka khêk bawk a, ka to chuong nawh."
"But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, aw nang Israelhai inpâknaa chêng hlak, Nang chu în thieng a nih."
"Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.","Kan thlatuhai chun an lo ring cheh a, An ring a; chuongchun, nangin i lo sandam hlak."
"They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.","An ko cheh a; chuongchun, sanhimin an um hlak a, An ring cheh a; chuongchun, muolphoin an um ngai nawh."
"But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people.","Kei ruok chu mihriem hrim ka ni nawh a, chawkchawnâl el ka nih, Mihriemhai hrilsiet le mihai hmusit ka nih."
"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,","A mi hmu taphawtin an mi nuisan a, An hner an phen a, an lu an thin a;"
"Commit thyself unto Jehovah; let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.","“LALPA chungah innghat ta la, ama chun ama hi sandam raw se chu! A chungah a lâwm leiin sanhim raw se chu,” an tih a."
But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts.,"Nang ruok chu sula inthawka mi la suoktu i na, Ka nu nêne chunga ka um lai khan nangin i mîn ringtir a."
I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me.,"Sula inthawk hrimin nangma chunga innghat ka na, Nang chu ka nu phîng sûnga inthawk hrim tah ka Pathien i nih."
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help.,"Mîn hlat lul naw rawh, lungin- zingna ding a hnai sih a, Ṭhangpuitu ding hrim hrim an um si nawh."
Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.,"Sebâwngchal tamtakin an mîn huolvêl a, Basan rama sebâwngchal hrât- takhai chun an mîn huolvêl khup a."
"They gape upon me with their mouth, As a ravening and a roaring lion.","Sakeibaknei hnukinrâwl inhûk hmang angin, An bauvin an mi khêkkhum a."
"I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.","Tui anga bunthlâkin ka um a, Ka ru po po khawm inpelsawlin a um a, Ka lungril hi khuoihlu ang a na; ka rîl lai hin ân tui zo tah."
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.,"Ka tha hi bekawihâr angin a ṭâwl zo vawng a, Ka lei khawm hi ka dangah a kawp ta tlat a; Nangin thina pilvuta hin i mi ṭhuoi lût tah a ni hi."
For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.,"Uihai chun an mîn huolvêl sih a, Thil ṭha naw thawtu um khâwmhai chun an mîn huol tlat a, Ka kut le ka kehai hi an sukpawp a."
I may count all my bones. They look and stare upon me;,"Ka ru po po hi ka tiem vawng thei a, Anni hlak chun an mi enin an mi mel zing a:"
"They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots.","Ka silfênhai an insem a, Ka zakuo dingin ai an sân a,"
"But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me.","Nang ruok chun, aw LALPA, mîn hlat lul naw la, Aw, mi sukhrâttu, mi ṭhangpui dingin inhmaw rawh."
"Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog.",Ka hringna hi kâwlhnâma inthawk chun sanhim la. Ka nei sun tak hi ui thilthawtheinaa inthawk chun sanhim rawh.
"Save me from the lion’s mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.","Sakeibaknei baua inthawk chu mi sanhim la, Anih, ramsielchal kiha mi chu nangin i mi dawn tah a."
I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.,"Ka unauhai kuomah i hming hril ka ta, Inkhâwmhai laia chun inpâk ka ti che."
"Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.","LALPA ṭituhai, ama chu inpâk ro, Jakob thla po pohai, ama chu chawimawi ro; Israel thla po pohai, ama chu ṭi ro."
"For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard.","Ama chun rinum tuortu rinumzie chu a hmusit nawh a, a tirdak bawk nawh; A hmai chu a kuoma inthawkin a thup nawh a, Ama a ko chun a lo ngai lem hlak."
Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.,"Inkhâwmna ropuitaka kân pâk hlakna che hi nangma kuoma mi a na, Ama ṭîtuhai hmaa chun ka thutiem hi hlen ka tih."
The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever.,"Thuhnuoirawlhai chun fâng an ta, tlai an tih: Ama zawngtuhai chun LALPA chu inpâk an ta, An lungril chu kumkhuoin hringin um raw se."
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.,"Kâwlkawdawnga mi po po khawmin hre nâwk an ta, LALPA tieng ngha tâng an tih: Hnam tina chi tin i hmaah kûn an tih."
For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; And he is the ruler over the nations.,"Ram chu LALPA ta a na, Hnam tin chungah rorêltu a ni sih a."
"All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.","Hnuoia mi neinunghai po po chun fain chibai bûk an ta, Pilvuta kîr nâwk dinghai po po khawm chu a hmaah la kûn an tih: Mâni hringna sukhring zing thei lo chu."
A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.,"Chi inthlain a rawng bâwl an ta, Ṭhangthar hung um nâwkhai kuoma chun LALPA chanchin chu la hril an tih."
"They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.","Hung an ta, hnam la hung suok dinghai kuoma chun, “A thaw zo tah,” tiin, a felzie chu lân hriettir an tih."
Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.,"LALPA chu ka ta dingin Berâmpu a nih, tlasam naw ningah."
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters.,"Ama chun hlohna hring dup hmunah a mîn bawktir hlak a, Châwlna tui pangahai a mi ṭhuoi hlak."
He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.,"Ka hringna hi a mi siemtharpêk nâwk hlak a, Ama hming leiin felna lampuiahai a mi ṭhuoi hlak."
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.","Anih, thina hlim varuom hraw lang khawm, Thil ṭha naw hrim hrim ṭi naw ningah, nang ka kuomah i um sih a: I hembâwk le i hmawlin a mi thlamuon hlak a nih."
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over.,"A mi dotuhai mithmuah ka hmaa hin dawkân i buotsai hlak a, Ka lu hi hriek i nâl tah a, ka noa hin a liem zing a."
Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.,"Matheiloin ṭhatna le ngilneinain ka dam sûng po po hin mi zui pei a ta: Chuongchun, LALPA inah kumkhuoin um zing ka tih."
"The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein.","Leilung hi LALPA ta a na, a sûnga um po pohai leh, Khawvêl le a sûnga chênghai le hin."
"For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods.","Tuisuoriet chungahai amain ân dinsuo a ni sih a, Tuilienhai chunga khawm a sukdet bawk a."
Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?,LALPA tlângah tu am hang lâwn a ta? A hmun inthiengah tu am ngîr a ta?
"He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully.","Kut fai le lungril inthieng neia, A lungril teplo mei mei tienga sie ngailo: Hlêm tuma inkhâm ngailo mi chu."
"He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation.","Ama chun LALPA kuoma inthawkin malsâwmna hmûng a ta, A sandamtu Pathien kuoma inthawkin felna dawng bawk a tih."
"This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, even Jacob. [Selah","Chu chu ama zawngtuhai suon a nih, Aw Jakob Pathien, i hmêl zawngtuhai chu."
"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.","Aw kul kawtkhârhai, in lu chung kha dawm sâng unla, Nangni kawtkhâr hlunhai, inkhai sâng ro: Chuongchun, ropuina LALPA hi a hung lût ding a nih."
"Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.","Ropuina Lal chu tu am a na? LALPA hrâttak le thilthawtheitak, LALPA indonaa thilthawtheitak chu a nih."
"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.","Aw kul kawtkhârhai, in lu chunghai kha dawm sâng ro, Anih, kawtkhâr hlunhai, dawm sâng unla, Chuongchun, Ropuina Lal hi a hung lût ding a nih."
"Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. [Selah","Chu Ropuina Lal chu tu am a na? Sipaihai LALPA chu, Ama ngei hi Ropuina Lal chu a nih."
"Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.","Aw LALPA, ka lungril hi i kuomah ka sie tlat hlak,"
"O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me.","Aw ka Pathien, nang ka ring cheh a, Muolphoin mîn umtir naw la, A mi dotuhai mi ngam ding chu phal naw rawh."
"Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause.","Anih, nangma nghâktu hrim hrim chu tukhawm muolphoin um naw ni hai, A san um loa vervêktaka thawtuhai ruok chu muolphoin um an tih."
"Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy paths.","Aw LALPA, i lampuihai chu mîn hriettir la, I lampui chanchinhai chu mîn chûktir rawh."
"Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day.","I thutaka chun mi ṭhuoi la, mîn chûktir rawh, Nang chu a mi sandamtu Pathien i ni sih a; Sûnnithlâkin ka nghâk zing che hi."
"Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old.","Aw LALPA, i lainatnahai le i ngilneinahai chu hre zing la, Inhmaa lo um kumkhuo tah a ni sih a."
"Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness’ sake, O Jehovah.","Ka tleirâwl lai suolnahai le ka bawsietnahai chu hre zing naw la, Aw LALPA, i ṭhatna leiin, I ngilneizie ang peiin mi hre zing rawh."
Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.,"LALPA chu a ṭhain ân dik a nih, Chuleiin, mi suolhai chu lampui kâwkhmûng a tih."
The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way.,"Thuhnuoirawlhai chu rorêlna felah ṭhuoi a ta, Thuhnuoirawlhai chu ama lampui chanchin inchûktir bawk a tih."
All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.,"A thuthlung le a thuinhriettir zâwmtuhai ta ding chun, LALPA lampui po pohai chu ngilneina le thutak vawng a nih."
"For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.","Aw LALPA, i hming leiin, Ka rîtlona ngaidam la, nasatak a ni sih a."
What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.,LALPA ṭi mi chu tu am a na? Ama chu a lampui thlang ding chu lân entir a tih.
His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land.,"A hringna chu inhawitirtakin um a ta, A thlahai chun ram chu la hluong an tih."
The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant.,"LALPA thurûk chu ama ṭituhai kuomah a um a, A thuthlung chu anni inhriettir a tih."
Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For he will pluck my feet out of the net.,"Ka mitin LALPA tieng a en rawp hlak a, Ama chun ka kehai hi lêna inthawk chun a lâk suok ding a ni sih a."
"Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; For I am desolate and afflicted.","Keia tieng hung ngha la, mi lunginsiet rawh, Khawsâwt le rinumtakin ka um sih a."
The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.,"Ka lungril buoinahai hi a hung nasa tah a, Aw ka lungzingnahaia inthawk hin mi ṭhuoi suok rawh."
Consider mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins.,"Ka rinumzie le ka tuorzie hi ngaituo la, Ka suol po po mi ngaidam rawh."
"Consider mine enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred.","A mi dotuhai chu ngaituo ta, tamtak an nih, Nasatakin an mi theida sih a."
"Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.","Aw ka hringna vawngṭha la, mi sanhim rawh; Muolphoin mîn umtir naw la, nangmaa chun ka ringna kân nghat sih a."
"Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for thee.",Lungril ṭhatna le indiknain mi vawng ṭha zing raw se. Ka nghâk zing si cheh a.
"Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all his troubles.","Aw Pathien, Israelhai hi, An lunginzîngna po poa inthawkin sansuok rawh."
"Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering.","Aw LALPA, ro mi rêlpêk rawh, lungril ṭhatak putin ka um sih a, Ringhla loin LALPA chu ka ring bawk a."
"Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind.","Aw LALPA, mi enfiein mi fie la, Ka lungril le ka lungvar hi sukthieng la,"
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; And I have walked in thy truth.,"I ngilneizie chu ka hmaah a um sih a, I thutaka chun ka um rawp bawk a."
I have not sat with men of falsehood; Neither will I go in with dissemblers.,"Mi hmangnabohai kâwlah ka ṭhung ngai nawh a, Mi vervêkhai kuoma khawm ka lût ngai bawk nawh."
"I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And will not sit with the wicked.","Thil ṭha naw thawtuhai inkhâwm chu ka theidah a, Mi rilohai kâwlah ṭhung naw ningah."
"I will wash my hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah;","Ka kuthai hi demkailonain sâwp ka ta, Chuong ang chun, aw LALPA, i mâichâm chu fe huol ka tih."
"That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works.","Lâwmthu hrilna ka sukrîk thei a, I thilmak thaw po po thuhai chu ka hril theina dingin."
"Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth.","LALPA, i umna in chu ka ngaina a, I ropuina umna khawm chu."
"Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood;","Mi suolhai laia chun mi peisa naw la, Ka hringna khawm hi thisen insuo hmanghai lai chun la sa bawk naw rawh."
"In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes.","An kuta chun ngaituona suol a um a, An kut changtieng chu thamnain a sip a;"
"But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chu lungril ṭhatak putin um ka tih, Mîn tlan la, mi lunginsiet rawh."
My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.,"Ka ke hi hmun inzâwltakah a ngîr a, Inkhâwmnaahai chun LALPA chu inpâk ka tih."
Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?,"LALPA chu ka var le ka sandamna a nih, tu am ṭîng ka ta? LALPA chu ka hringna kulbîng a nih; tu am ṭîng ka ta?"
"When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.","Thil ṭha naw thawhai, mi dotu- hai le ka hmêlmahai chun, ka sa fâk tuma an mi thaw lai khan, An insui a, an tlu tâwl tah a."
"Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident.","Sipai pâwlhai chun mi thaw tumin mi ep zing hai sienla khawm, Ka lungril hin ṭi naw ni; Ka chungah indona hung suok sienla khawm, Chuong ang a khawm chun ring tlat ka tih."
"One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple.","LALPA kuomah thil pakhat ka hnih a, chu mawl chu zawng ka tih, LALPA mawizie hmu ding le a biekina thu indawn dingin, Ka dam sûng poa LALPA ina ka um zing theina ding chu."
For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.,"Lunginzîng ni chun a bûktêah a mi sie hmang âwm sih a, A humhimna puon ina chun mi thuphmang a tih; Lungpui chungah mi dawm kai a tih."
"And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.","Tuhin chu a mi dotu, a mîn huolvêltuhai chungtieng ka lu hi dawm kângin um a tih, Chuongchun, a puon ina chun hlimna inthâwinahai inhlân ka tih; Hla sak ka ta, anih, LALPA inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
"Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.","Aw LALPA, ka râwla ka ko che chun lo ngai la, Mi lunginsiet la, mi dawn bawk rawh."
"When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.","“Ka hmêl zawng ro,” tih a i hril lai khan, ka lungril chun i kuomah, “LALPA, i hmêl zawng ka tih,” a tih a."
"Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.","Ka kuoma inthawk hin i hmai thup naw la, I siehlaw hi i lunginsenin sukbohmang naw la, Nang chu a mi ṭhangpuitu i ni hlak a, Aw a mi sandamtu Pathien, mi pei thla naw la, mi mâksan lul naw rawh."
"When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up.","Ka nu le pa chun an mi mâksan ta sih a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun mi la pawm a tih."
"Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.","Aw LALPA, i lampui chu mîn entir la, Ka hmêlmahai lei hin, Lampui inpheitakah mi ṭhuoi rawh."
"Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.","A mi dotuhaiin nuom nuoma an mi thaw dingin mi pe lul naw la, Hretu tehlêm chun an mi thawh a, nunsiet thu sâksuok hlaktuhai chun."
"I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.","Mi hring rama hin, LALPA ṭhatna hmu inring naw lang chu ka chau ta ding a nih."
"Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.","LALPA chu nghâk zing rawh, Hrâttakin um la, i lungril chu insukhuoi raw se; Anih, LALPA chu nghâk zing rawh."
"Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.","Aw LALPA, ka ko ding che a ni hi, Ka lungpui, keimaa inthawk hin i na chu suksêt naw la; Chuong naw chun, nangin i mi tosan chun, Khur sûnga zu fehai ang elin hung um rawi ka tih."
"Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.","Ka ko cheh a, ka kuthai hi i biekna hmun inthieng tieng ka phar chun, Lunginsiet ka hnina râwlhai hi lo ngai rawh."
"Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But mischief is in their hearts.","Mi rilohai le thil suksuolhai laia chun, Mi hnûkhmang sa naw rawh. Chuonghai chun an vênghai kuomah inremnna thu an hril hlak a, Nisienlakhawm, an lungrilhaia chun thil suksuolna a um zing sih a."
"Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: Give them after the operation of their hands; Render to them their desert.","An thilthaw ang pei le, an thilthawhai a suolzie ang peiin thung la, An kuta an sinthaw ang peiin thung la; An suol man chu inhmutir rawh."
"Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not build them up.","LALPA sinthawhai le, A kuta a thilthaw chu an ngaisak naw leiin, Ama chun anni chu siemṭha loin suksieng a tih."
"Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.","Lunginsiet ka hnîna râwlhai hi a ngai hlak leiin, LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se."
"Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him.","LALPA chu ka hrâtna le ka phaw a na, Ka lungril hin ama chu a ring a; chuongchun, sanin ka um a, Chuleiin, ka lungril hi nasatakin a hlim a, Ka hla chun ama inpâk ka tih."
"Jehovah is their strength, And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.","LALPA chu an hrâtna a na, A hrieknâl ta ding chun sandamna kulbîng a nih."
"Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.","I mihai chu sandam la, i rochan chu malsâwm rawh: Anni chu châwm la, kumkhuoin pawm rawh."
"Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.","Aw mi thilthawtheitak nauhai, LALPA kuomah pe unla, LALPA kuoma chun ropuina le hrâtna pe ro."
Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array.,"LALPA kuomah a hming ropuina chu pe unla, Inthieng mawina inbelin LALPA chu chibai bûk ro,"
"The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters.","LALPA râwl chu tuihai chunga chun ân rih a, Ropuina Pathien chu a hung inri dur dur a, LALPA ngei chu tui tamtak chunghaia chun a hung in- rih a,"
The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.,"LALPA râwl chu thilthawtheitak a na, LALPA râwl chu ropuitak a nih."
"The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.","LALPA râwl chun Sidar thinghai chu sukthliek a ta, Anih, LALPA chun Lebanon tlânga sidar thinghai chu a sukthliek seng sung hlak."
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.,"Bâwngte tuoltla angin ân changtir hlak a, Lebanon chu bâwngte tuoltla angin ân châwmtir hlak a, Sirion tlânghai chu ramsiel tê ang elin."
The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire.,LALPA râwl chun meichawkhai chu a thlêr hlak a.
The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.,LALPA râwl chun thlalêr a tlawr hnîng a; LALPA chun Kades thlalêr chu a sukhnîng hlak.
"The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything saith, Glory.","LALPA râwl chun sazukpui chu tê ân siettir a, Rampui thinghnahai chu a nuoi kawl vawng hlak a: A biekina chun thil iengkimin, “A ropui ie,” an ti seng hlak."
"Jehovah sat as King at the Flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever.","LALPA chu Tuilêt lai khan lalah a ṭhung a, Anih, LALPA chu kumkhuoa dingin lalah a ṭhung a nih."
Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.,"LALPA chun a mihai kuomah hrâtna pêng a ta, LALPA chun a mihai chu thla- muongnain malsâwm a tih."
"Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.","LALPA, a mi dotuhai hi an va pung ta de! A mi hung thawtuhai hi tamtak an nih;"
"Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. [Selah","“Pathiena chun a ta dingin ṭhangpuina hrim a um nawh,” tia, Ka hringna chungchâng thu hriltu tamtak an um."
"But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory, and the lifter up of my head.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, nang chu ka vêlin ka phaw i na, Ka ropuina le ka lu dawm kângtu i nih."
"I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. [Selah","Ka râwlin LALPA chu ka ko a, A tlâng inthienga inthawk chun a mi hung dawn hlak a."
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.,"Kei chu ka zâl chu ka lo ininnghil tah a; Ka hang har nâwk a, LALPA chun a mi lo chel zing hlak a nih."
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.,"Mi sîng khat khawm hi ṭi naw ning, Kei mi hung doa, mi hung inhuol vêltuhai hi."
"Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.","Aw LALPA, tho la, aw ka Pathien; mi sandam rawh! Ka hmêlmahai po po bekbawra chun i benpêk tâwl ta sih a; Mi rilohai hahai chu i suk- tlam a."
Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. [Selah,"Sandamna chu LALPA ta a na, I malsâwmna chu i mihai chungah um raw se."
"I will extol thee, O Jehovah; for thou hast raised me up, And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.","Aw LALPA, chawimawi ka ti che, nangin i mi dawm sâng sih a; A mi dotuhai chu mi diriem dingin i siem nawh a."
"O Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, Ka ko cheh a, nangin i mi sukdam tah a."
"O Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.","Aw LALPA, nangin ka hringna hi Seola inthawk chun i ṭhuoi suok a: Khur sûnga ka ṭum nawna dingin, nangin i mi hum dam sih a."
"Sing praise unto Jehovah, O ye saints of his, And give thanks to his holy memorial name.","Aw a mi inthienghai, LALPA inpâkin hla sak unla, A hming inthieng chu inpâk ro."
"For his anger is but for a moment; His favor is for a life-time: Weeping may tarry for the night, But joy cometh in the morning.","A lungsen chu mitkhap kâr chaua ding a ni sih a; A ditsakna ruok chu dam sûnga ding a nih. Ṭapna chun zânkhuo a dai thei a, Hlimna ruok chu zîngkâr a hung tlung hlak."
"As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.","Kei chun chu ka hlawtling lai chun, “Iengtika khawm inhnîng naw ning,” ka tih a."
"Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong: Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.","LALPA, nangin i ditsakna leiin ka tlâng chu i lo inngîrdettir tah a: Nisienlakhawm, i hmai i thup a, ka lo lunginzîng tah a."
"I cried to thee, O Jehovah; And unto Jehovah I made supplication:","Aw LALPA nang ka ko cheh a, LALPA kuoma ngei chun lungsietna ka hni kha:"
"What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?",Khur sûnga ka zu ṭum chun ka thisena hin hlâwkna ieng am um a ta? Pilvut chun ân pâk ding che am a nih? I thutak chu ân hriettir ding am a nih?
"Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me: Jehovah, be thou my helper.","Aw LALPA, lo ngai la, mi lunginsiet rawh: LALPA, nang chu mi ṭhangpuitu ni rawh."
"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;","Ka mithi ngaina chu ka ta ding- in lâmnaah în changtir a, Ka saiip puon chu i mi hlîppêk a, ka kâwngah hlimnain i mi khit tah a:"
"To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.","Ka ropuina hi to zing loa, nangma inpâka hla a sakna dingin, Aw LALPA ka Pathien, kumkhuoin lâwmthu hril rawp ka ti che."
"In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge; Let me never be put to shame: Deliver me in thy righteousness.","Aw LALPA, nangmaa chun ka ringna kân nghat hlak a, Iengtika khawm muolphoin mîn umtir naw la: I felna lei chun mi sanhim rawh."
"Bow down thine ear unto me; deliver me speedily: Be thou to me a strong rock, A house of defence to save me.","Keia tieng hin i na hung sit la, mi sanhim vat la, Ka ta dingin lungpui dettak, mi sandam dinga humhimna in, hung ni rawh."
For thou art my rock and my fortress; Therefore for thy name’s sake lead me and guide me.,"Nang chu ka lungpui le ka kulpui i ni sih a; Chuleiin, i hming leiin mi ṭhuoiin mi kei rawh."
Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; For thou art my stronghold.,"Ka âwkna dinga a rûka lên an phaha inthawk hin mi kei suok la, Nang chu ka kulbîng i ni sih a."
"Into thy hand I commend my spirit: Thou hast redeemed me, O Jehovah, thou God of truth.","I kutah ka thlarau kân kawl- tir a, Aw LALPA, thutak Pathien, nang chun i mîn tlan tah."
I hate them that regard lying vanities; But I trust in Jehovah.,"Milim teplo mei mei ngaisâng- tuhai chu ka theida a, Kei ruok chun chu LALPA ka ring a nih."
I will be glad and rejoice in thy lovingkindness; For thou hast seen my affliction: Thou hast known my soul in adversities;,"I ngilneina lei hin hlimin lâwm ka tih. Ka lunginzîngna hi i hmu si hlak a, Ka hringna hi a rinum lai khawmin i hriet hlak."
And thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a large place.,"A mi dotuhai kutah nangin i mi khum nawh a, Ka ke hi hmun inthâwltakah în nghat ta lem a."
"Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress: Mine eye wasteth away with grief, yea, my soul and my body.","Aw LALPA, mi lunginsiet la, lunginzîngin ka um sih a, Ka mit hi lungngaina leiin a chau deu deu a, anih, ka hringna le ka taksa chenin."
"For my life is spent with sorrow, And my years with sighing: My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, And my bones are wasted away.","Ka dam sûng hi lungngainain a liem ta sih a, ka kumhai hi inrûmin a liem ta bawk a nih. Ka rîtlona leiin ka tha a ṭhum a, ka ruhai khawm a rawp zo tah a."
"Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, Yea, unto my neighbors exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintance: They that did see me without fled from me.","A mi dotuhai leiin ka hming hi a hung se tah a, Anih, ka vênghai lai khawm nasatakin a se tah a nih, ka hmêlhriethai ta ding khawm- a ṭiumtak ka lo ni tah a: Khawlaia mi hmutuhai khan an mi tlânsan ta sih a."
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.,"Mi thi an theinghil ang taka theinghilin ka um a, Bêl kawi ang el ka hung ni tah a."
"For I have heard the defaming of many, Terror on every side: While they took counsel together against me, They devised to take away my life.","Mi tamtak mi hêkna ka hriet sih a, Ka vêla ṭium um chu: An mi phier lai khan, Ka hringna mi lâkpêk an tum a."
"But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah: I said, Thou art my God.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, ka ring cheh a, “Ka Pathien i nih,” ka tih a."
"My times are in thy hand: Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.","Ka hunhai chu i kutah a um a, A mi dotuhai le a mi suknawmnatuhaia inthawk hin mi sanhim rawh."
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: Save me in thy lovingkindness.,"I hmêlin i siehlaw hi hung sunvar la, I ngilneina leiin mi sandam rawh."
"Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah; for I have called upon thee: Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.","Aw LALPA, muolphoin mîn umtir naw la, ka ko si cheh a: Mi rilohai chu muolphoin um hai sienla, Seolah to zingin um raw se."
"Let the lying lips be dumb, Which speak against the righteous insolently, With pride and contempt.","Hmûr khêlhliphai chu ṭawng theiloin um raw se, Chuonghai chun chapo le hmusit pumin, Ṭawng chapotakin mi fel an hrilsiet hlak a."
"Oh how great is thy goodness, Which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, Which thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in thee, Before the sons of men!","Aw i ṭhatna, nangma ṭituhai ta dinga în khâwl chu a va nasa de; Mihriem nauhai mithmuha nangmaa ringna innghattuhai ta dinga i thawpêk chu."
In the covert of thy presence wilt thou hide them from the plottings of man: Thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.,"Anni chu mihriem phiernaa inthawk chun i humhimna mithmuah thuphmang i ta, Hnuoi sêlhrâtnaa inthawk chun bûktêah sie rûng i tih."
Blessed be Jehovah; For he hath showed me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city.,"LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se, A ngilneina maktak chu khaw- pui dettakah a mîn hmutir sih a."
"As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications, When I cried unto thee.","Kei hlak chun, ka lunginzing- in, “I mithmuah inthawka pei hmangin ka um tah,” ka lo tih a. Nisienlakhawm, ka ko che khan, lunginsiet ka hnina râwlhai kha i lo hriet sih a."
"Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints: Jehovah preserveth the faithful, And plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly.","Aw a mi inthieng po pohai, LALPA chu hmangai ro: LALPA chun mi ringum chu a humhim a, Chapotaka thawtu chu nasatakin a thung hlak."
"Be strong, and let your heart take courage, All ye that hope in Jehovah.","LALPA beiseitu po pohai, Hrâttakin um unla, in lungril chu insukhuoi raw se."
"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.","A bawsietna ngaidama uma, a suolna inkhuma um chu, a hamṭha,"
"Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.","Mi LALPAIN rîtlona neia a ruot naw, A thlaraua hlêmna hrim hrim um naw chu, a hamṭha."
"When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long.","Ka suol ka topui zing lai khan, sunnithlâka kân rûmna leiin, Ka taksa hi a châu tiel tiel a."
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer. [Selah,"A sûn a zânin i kutin a mi del sih a; Ka taksa hnâwngna khawm, ṭhâlrumin thil a sukdanglam angin, a hung danglam ta hiel kha."
"I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. [Selah","Ka suolna chu i kuomah ka phuong a, Ka rîtlona chu ka ip ta nawh a, “Ka bawsietna chu LALPA kuomah thupha châwi tâng ka tih,” ka tih a; Chuongchun, ka suol rîtlona chu i lo ngaidam ta kha."
For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.,"Chuleiin, Pathien ngaisak mi taphawt chu zawnghmu awla i um laiin i kuomah ṭawngṭâi seng raw hai se; Tui lienhai chu a hung liem pha chun anni chu a chîm phâk vak nawna dingin."
Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. [Selah,"Nang chu kân bîkhmangna hmun i na, nang chun lunginzîngnaa inthawk mi humhim i ta, Sanhimna hlahaiin mîn huolvêltir i tih."
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.,"I fena ding lampui chu inchûk- tirin, kâwkhmûng ka ti cheh a, Ka mita en zing pum chein rem ruotpêk ka ti che."
"Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, Else they will not come near unto thee.","Ngaituona nei naw sakawr ama- nih, sabengtung amani angin um naw ro, Anni chun chelngîrna ding thîrbar amanih, keingîrna dinga hrui dâm an ṭûl hlak sih a; Chuong naw chun i kâwl hnaiah hung naw ni hai."
"Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.","Mi rilo ta ding chun lungngaina tamtak um a ta, LALPA ringtu ruok chu ngil- neinain inhuolvêl lem a tih."
"Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.","Mi felhai, LALPAA chun hlimin lâwm unla, Lungril indiktak put po pohai, hlimin khêk ro."
"Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous: Praise is comely for the upright.","Aw mi felhai, LALPAA chun hlimin hla sak ro, Mi indik ta ding chun Pathien inpâk hi a âwm hrim a nih."
Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp: Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.,"Ṭingṭangin LALPA kuoma chun lâwmthu hril unla, Perkhuong hrui sâwm nei mi leh ama inpâkin hla sak ro."
Sing unto him a new song; Play skilfully with a loud noise.,"Ama chawimawiin hla thar sak unla, Ri nasatak leh thiemtakin sut ro."
For the word of Jehovah is right; And all his work is done in faithfulness.,"LALPA thu chu ân dik a, A thilthaw po po chu ringum- taka thaw a ni si hlak a."
He loveth righteousness and justice: The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah.,Felna le rorêlna fel hi a ngaina hlak a; Leihnuoi hi LALPA ngilneinain a sip a.
"By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.","LALPA thuin vânhai chu siem a na, Chuonga umhai po po khawm chu a baua thuok chun siem an ni bawk a."
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: He layeth up the deeps in store-houses.,"Ama chun tuisuoriet tuihai chu iengkhat siekhâwm thûr angin a sukkhâwm a, Tui inthûktakhai chu siekhâwm- na inahai a sieṭha hlak."
Let all the earth fear Jehovah: Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.,"Leihnuoi hluo po pohai chun LALPA chu ṭî hai sienla, Khawvêla um po pohai chu ama ṭiin um raw se."
"For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.","Ama chun a hril a, a hung um tah a, Thu a pêk a, a hung det ta sih a."
Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.,"LALPAIN hnam tin remruot chu iengkhawm ni loah ân changtir a, Mi tin ngaituohai chu iengkhawm ṭhathnemna nei loin a siem hlak."
"The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast for ever, The thoughts of his heart to all generations.","LALPA remruot ruok chu kumkhuoin um det a ta, A lungrila a ngaituohai chu suon po po chenin umdet a tih."
"Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.","LALPA Pathiena nei hnam chu an hamṭha a, Ama rochan dinga a thlang mihai chu."
Jehovah looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men;,"LALPA chun vâna inthawk khin a thlîr a, Mihriem nauhai po po hi a hmu hlak."
"From the place of his habitation he looketh forth Upon all the inhabitants of the earth,","Hnuoia um po po hi, A umna hmuna inthawk khin a hung thlîr hlak,"
"He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, That considereth all their works.","An rênga lungril siem hlak a, An thilthaw po po ngaituo hlaktu chun."
There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.,Lal hrim hrim hi sipaihai tam lei ngawta sandama um an um ngai nawh: Mi hrât hi hrât bêk bêk lei ngawta sanhim an ni ngai nawh.
A horse is a vain thing for safety; Neither doth he deliver any by his great power.,"Sakawr hi insanhimna dingin iengkhawm a ni nawh a, A hrât bêk bêk leiin tukhawm sanhim bawk naw nih."
"Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness;","Ngai ta, LALPA mit chu ama ṭîtuhai chunga chun a fu zing hlak a, A ngilneina beiseituhai chunga chun."
"To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.","An hringna thinaa inthawka sanhim ding le, Ṭâm tlâk phaa anni tungnung dingin."
Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: He is our help and our shield.,"Ei hringna hin LALPA a nghâk zing a, Ama chu mi ṭhangpuitu le ei phaw a nih."
"For our heart shall rejoice in him, Because we have trusted in his holy name.","Amaa chun ei lungril hi a hlim ding a nih, A hming inthieng ei ring leiin."
"Let thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, According as we have hoped in thee.","Aw LALPA, i ngilneina chu kan chungah um raw se. Kan beisei ang pei chein."
I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.,"Ienglai khawmin LALPA chu inpâk ka ta, Ama inpâkna chu ka bauah suok rawp a tih."
"My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.","Ka hringna hin LALPA chu sawng a ta, Mi rimsihai chun chu chu hrieng an ta, lâwm an tih."
"Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together.","Aw LALPA chu mîn pâkpui unla, A hming chu chawimawi seng ei tiu."
"I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.","LALPA chu ka zawng a, chun, ama chun a mi dawn a. Ka iṭi po poa inthawk chun a mi sanhim tah."
"They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded.","Ama an en a, chun, an hung var suok tah a, An hmêlhai chu iengtika khawm inzak naw ni."
"This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles.","Hi mi rimsi hi a khêk a, LALPA chun a lo hriet a, A lunginzîngna po poa chun a sansuok tah a."
"The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, And delivereth them.",Ama ṭîtuhai chu an vêla chun LALPA vântirko chun a um nghah a. A sanhim hlak.
Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good: Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him.,Aw LALPA ṭhatzie chu intem sin hrim ta u: Amaa ringna innghattu chu a hamṭha.
"Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him.","Aw, a mi inthienghai, LALPA chu ṭi unla, Ama ṭîtuhai ta ding chun tlâksamna hrim hrim a um si nawh."
"The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.",Sakeibaknei vânglaihai chu an tlasamin an phîng a ṭâm hlak a: LALPA zawngtuhai ruok chun thil ṭha hrim hrim tlasam naw ni hai.
"Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.","Hung ro, naupanghai ka thu ngai ta u, LALPA ṭi dân lo inchûktir ka ti cheu."
"What man is he that desireth life, And loveth many days, that he may see good?","Thilṭha a hmu theina dinga hringna dita, Dam sâwt ngaina mi chu tu am a na?"
"Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile.","I lei chu suola inthawkin vêngṭha la, I hmûr chu hlêmna thu hril lo dingin."
"Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.","Suol chu fe san la, thil ṭha thaw rawh; Inremna zawng la, a hnawtin hnawt rawh."
"The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, And his ears are open unto their cry.","LALPA mit chun mi felhai tieng a en hlak a, Ama chun an khêk hre dingin a ngai zing hlak."
"The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.","LALPA hmêl chun thil suk- suoltuhai chu a do hlak a, Anni hriet zingna chu hnuoia inthawka sukbohmang dingin."
"The righteous cried, and Jehovah heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles.","Mi felhai chu an khêk a; LALPA chun a lo hriet a, An lunginzîngna po poa chun a sansuok tah a."
"Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.","LALPA chun lungrila lung- riem ithlâkhai chu a hnai hlak a, Lungrila insîrhai po chu a sandam hlak."
Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all.,"Mi fel rinumnahai chu a tam a, Nisienlakhawm, chuong po poa chun LALPAIN a sansuok hlak."
He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken.,"A ru po po a vawng ṭhah a, Pakhat khawm sukthliek a ni nawh."
Evil shall slay the wicked; And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.,"Thil ṭha nawin mi rilohai chu sukhlum a ta, Mi fel theidatuhai chun thiemnaw chang an tih."
Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.,"LALPA chun a siehlawhai hringna chu ân tlan hlak a, Amaa ringna innghattuhai chu pakhat khawm thiemnaw chang um naw ni hai."
"Strive thou, O Jehovah, with them that strive with me: Fight thou against them that fight against me.","Aw LALPA, a mi thawtuhai chu nangin thaw la, A mi dotuhai chu nangin do rawh."
"Take hold of shield and buckler, And stand up for my help.","Phaw chîn le phaw lien chel la, Mi ṭhangpui dingin ngîr rawh."
"Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me: Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.","Fei le hreipui chu inlet la, A mi hnawttuhai lampui chu lo dang la, Ka hringna kuoma hin, “I sandamna ka nih,” ti rawh."
Let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor that seek after my soul: Let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt.,"Ka hringna sukbo tuma zawngtuhai chu, sukmuolphoa sukzakin umhai sienla, Mi suksietna ding ngaituotuhai chu intlânsiettirin thuokdawngtakin um raw se."
"Let them be as chaff before the wind, And the angel of Jehovah driving them on.","LALPA vântirkoin khal peiin, Busî thli ilên angin um raw se."
"Let their way be dark and slippery, And the angel of Jehovah pursuing them.","LALPA vântirkoin hnawt pei sien, An lampui chu inthimtak le innâltak ni raw se."
For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit; Without cause have they digged a pit for my soul.,"A san um loin, an mi âwkna dingin an lên chu khura chun an pha inrûk a, A san um loin ka hringna tlâk- na dingin khur an cho sih a."
Let destruction come upon him unawares; And let his net that he hath hid catch himself: With destruction let him fall therein.,Ân ringnaw kârin sietna a chungah tlung sienla; A lên pha rûka khan ama ngei âwk bawk sienla: Chutaka chun tla se dêr raw se.
And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah: It shall rejoice in his salvation.,"Chuongchun, ka hringna hi LALPAA chun hlim a ta; A sandamnaa chun lâwm a tih."
"All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is like unto thee, Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, Yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him?","Ka ru po po hin, “LALPA, mi rimsi, a khing zo ruolloa inthawka sanhimtu, Anih, rimsi le pasie, ama inram hlaktua inthawka sanhimtu, Nang ang hrim tu am um?” tîng a tih."
Unrighteous witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I know not.,"Hretu fel nawtakhai an hung tho a, Ka thil hriet dêr naw thua dâm an mi suosal a."
"They reward me evil for good, To the bereaving of my soul.","Ka hringna khawm beidawng dêr khawpin, Thil ṭha thil suolin an mi thung a."
"But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting; And my prayer returned into mine own bosom.","Kei ruok chu, an damnaw lai chun ka silfên chu saiip a na, Ka hringna hi bu ngheiin ka suk rimsi sih a; Lungse taka kûnin ka ṭawngṭai a,"
"I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother.","Ka ruol amanih, ka unau amani chunga chun ka um dân ding ang takin ka um a; Kân lawn vêl chu khuo khawm ngha ngam loa ngûiin. Mi a nu ṭâtu angin sûnin ka kûn a."
"But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; They did tear me, and ceased not:","Nisienlakhawm, ka chan a sein anni chu an lâwm a, an inhâwr khâwm hiel a, Mi suol teplohai chu mi thaw dingin an inkhâwm a, chu chu ka lo hriet si nawh. Ma nuom loin an mi sawisa hrep a."
"Like the profane mockers in feasts, They gnashed upon me with their teeth.","Ruoiṭhenaa nuiza fiemthu hriltuhai ang mei meiin, An ha an mi râwt khum a."
"Lord, how long wilt thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, My darling from the lions.","LALPA, nangin ieng chen am i en ding a na? Ka hringna hi suksiet an tumnaa inthawk chun sansuok la; Ka nei suntak hi sakeibakneia inthawk chun sansuok rawh."
I will give thee thanks in the great assembly: I will praise thee among much people.,"Inkhâwmna ropuitaka chun lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, Mi tamtak laia chun inpâk ka ti che."
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.,"Ka hmêlmahai chun indiknaw- takin mi diriem naw raw hai se, Ieng ni loa a mi theidatuhai chu an mitin inbe naw bawk raw hai se."
For they speak not peace; But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.,"Inremna thu hrim an hril si nawh a, Hi rama um ṭawk ṭawkin hlêmna thuhai an ngaituo lem a nih."
"Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.","Anih, an bauin an mi kâk khum puou a, “Chei! Chei! ei mit ngeiin ei hmu tah,” an tih a."
"Thou hast seen it, O Jehovah; keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.","Aw LALPA, nangin i hmuh a, tosan naw rawh, Aw LALPA, mîn hlat naw rawh."
"Stir up thyself, and awake to the justice due unto me, Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.","Ka Pathien le ka LALPA, ka ro rêl dingin, Anih, ka thuha mi ṭan ding- in, insukhar la, meng rawh."
"Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according to thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, i felna ang peiin ro mi rêlpêk la, Anni chun mi diriem naw raw hai se."
"Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it: Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.","An lungrilin, “Chei! chuong ang chu a ni annâwm ei dit chu,” ti naw raw se. “Ama chu ei lem zo tah,” ti naw bawk raw se."
Let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt: Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.,"Ka sietna chunga lâwmhai chu muolphotak le thuokdawng- takin um hai sienla, Ka chunga insuklienhai chu muolphona le inzakna insiltirin um raw se."
"Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause: Yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified, Who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.","Ka felna chunga lâwmhai chu hlima khêkin lâwmtakin um sienla, Anih, “A siehlaw vângneina chunga lâwm hlak LALPA chu, Chawimawiin um raw se,” ti rawp raw hai se."
And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness And of thy praise all the day long.,"Chuongchun, ka lei hin i felna thu hril a ta, Nangma inpâkna thu khawm sûnnithlâkin hril bawk a tih."
"The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.","Mi rilo bawsietna chun ka lungril sûnga hin thu a hril a, “A mithmuah Pathien ṭîna hrim hrim a um nawh,” tiin."
"For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.","“Ka khawhlona hmu suok naw ni hai a, theida hliek naw ni hai,” tiin. Mâni mithmuah mâni vêk ân pâk fâwm hlak a,"
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: He hath ceased to be wise and to do good.,"A baua thu suokhai chu suolna le hlêmna ruok a ni hlak a, Varna le thil ṭha thawna chu a bânsan tah a."
He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; He setteth himself in a way that is not good; He abhorreth not evil.,"A khumlaizâwla chun thilsuol a ngaituo hlak a, Lampui ṭha nawa chun a fe hrâm hrâm a, Suolna chu a tirdak nawh."
"Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.","Aw LALPA, i ngilneina chu vânhaia khin a um a, I ringumna chun vân dumhai khi a tawng a nih."
"Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are a great deep: O Jehovah, thou preservest man and beast.","I felna chu Pathien tlânghai ang a na, I rorêlhai chu tui inthûk lientak ang a nih; Aw LALPA, mihriem le sa khawm i humhim hlak."
"How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.","Aw Pathien, i ngilneina chu a va hlu de! Mihriem nauhai chun i thla hnuoi an inchû hlak."
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; And thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.,"Anni chu i insûng thil ṭhain tlai bêk bêk an ta, I lâwmna vadunga mi chu indâwntir bawk i tih."
For with thee is the fountain of life: In thy light shall we see light.,Hringna tuikhur chu i kuomah a um sih a. I vara chun var la hmûng kan tih.
"Oh continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee, And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.","Aw, nangma hretuhai kuoma chun i ngilneina chu inlangtir pei la, Lungril indiktak puttuhai kuomah felna chu inlangtir pei bawk rawh,"
"Let not the foot of pride come against me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.","Chapo ke chu mi thaw dingin keia tieng hung pên naw sienla, Mi rilo kut khawmin mi hnawt hmang naw raw se."
"There are the workers of iniquity fallen: They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.","Sawtaka sawn thilsuksuoltuhai chu an tlu zing a, Nam thlûk an na, tho thei ta naw ni hai."
"Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.","Thil ṭha naw thawtuhai leiin insuklungngai nuom naw la, Fel nawtaka thawtuhai chu inhnar bawk naw rawh."
"For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb.","Hlohna angin ât thlukin um vak an ta, Hna hring angin an vuoi ding a ni sih a."
"Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on his faithfulness.","LALPA chu ring la, thil ṭha thaw rawh, Hi rama hin um la, ringumna chu hnawt pei rawh."
Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart.,"LALPA chunga chun lâwm bawk la, Chuongchun, i lungril dit zâwnghai chu pêng a ti che."
"Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.","I um dân ding chu LALPA chungah innghat la, Ama chu ring la, amain thaw vawng a tih."
"And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noonday.","I felzie chu var angin insuoktir a ta, I thiemchangzie khawm chu sûnlai ang elin."
"Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.","LALPAA chun châwl la, ama chu nghâk fan fan rawh; Ama lampuia vângneina dawngtu lei chun insuklungngai nuom naw rawh, Ngaituo suolhai puitlintu lei chun."
"Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.","Lunginsen hi bânsan la, lungsenna chu sim rawh. Insuklungngai nuom naw, thil- suksuolah inchang thei a nih."
"For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.","Thil ṭha naw thawtuhai chu sukbohmangin an um ding a ni sih a, LALPA nghâktuhai ruok chun ram hi hluong an tih."
"For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.","Sâwt nawtê hnungah mi rilo chu a um ta awm si nawh a, Anih, a umna hmun chu en en hman la khawm um ta naw ni."
"But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.","Thuhnuoirawlhai ruok chun ram hi hluong an ta, Inremna nasatak chungah lâwm an tih."
"The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.","Mi rilo chun mi fel a phier- rûk a, A ha a râwt khum hlak."
The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.,"LALPA chun ama chu nuisan a ta, A ni a hung tlung ding a ni ti a hriet leiin."
"The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.","Rimsi le pasiehai sukthlu ding le, Umdân indikhai sukhlum dingin, Mi rilohai chun an kâwlhnâm an phawi a, an thalngul an kuoi bawk a."
"Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken.","An kâwlhnâm chun anni lung chu sun a ta, An thalngulhai sukthliekin um bawk a tih."
Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked.,"Mi fel thil tlâwmte nei chu, Mi rilo thil nei hnêr hnûr nêk chun a ṭha lem dai a nih."
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.,"Mi rilo bânhai chu sukthliekin a um ding a ni sih a, Mi fel ruok chu LALPAIN a chel zing hlak."
Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever.,"LALPA chun mi ṭha famkim nihai chu a hriet a, An rohluo ding chu kumkhuoa um zing ding a nih."
They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.,"Hun ṭha nawah muolpho naw ni hai a, Ṭâm kumahai khawm khawp an tih."
"But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away.","Mi rilohai ruok chu bohmang an ta, LALPA dotuhai khawm phûl hlohna inno ang nîng an ta, Sukbohmangin um an ta, meikhuah inzâm hmang an tih."
"The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.","Mi rilo chun a pûk a, a pêk nâwk ngai nawh a, Mi fel ruok chun mi a lunginsiet a, a pêk lem hlak."
For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.,"A malsâwmna dawngtuhai chun ram hi hluong an ta, A ṭawngse phurtuhai chu sukbohmangin an um ding a nih."
A man’s goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way.,"LALPAIN mihriem chu a fena dingah a ṭhuoi hlak a, A kalchawi a ilâwm chu a sukdet hlak."
"Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.","Tlu sienla khawm tlu letdêr chun um naw nih a, LALPAIN a kutin a chel zing sih a."
"I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.","Naupang ka lo ni tah a, tuhin tar ka ni tah a, Nisienlakhawm, mi fel chu mâksana a um ka hmu ngai nawh a, A thlahai bu dâwl khawm ka hmu ngai nawh."
"All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed.","Sûnnithlâkin mi a lunginsiet a, ân pûktir hlak, A thlahai khawm an hamṭha hlak."
"Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore.","Suol fe san la, thil ṭha thaw rawh, Chuongchun, kumkhuoin chêng zing rawh."
"For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.","LALPA chun rorêlna fel a ngaina sih a, A mi inthienghai chu a fesan ngai nawh a. Kumkhuoha dinga vawngṭhatin an um hlak a, Mi rilo thlahai ruok chu sukbohmangin um an tih."
"The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever.","Mi felhai chun ram hi hluong an ta, A sûnga hin kumkhuoin um an tih."
"The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice.","Mi fel bau chun varna thu a hril hlak a, A lei chun rorêl felna thu a hril bawk hlak."
The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide.,"A Pathien dân chu a lungrilah a um a, A ke pên hrim hrim chu intawl naw nih."
"The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him.","Mi rilo chun mi fel chu a enthlit a, Sukhlum a tum hlak."
"Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.","LALPAIN ama chu a kutah mâksan naw nih a, An ro a rêl pha chun thiemnaw inchangtir phal bawk naw ni."
"Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.","LALPA chu nghâk la, a lampui chu hraw rawh, Chuongchun, ram chu hluo dingin chawimawi a ti che. Mi rilohai sukbohmanga an um lai chu la hmûng i tih."
"I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.","Mi rilo chu nasataka thu neia, A mâwngna hmuna thing inder inno tak anga inbuk luoia a um lai ka hmuh a,"
"But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.","Nisienlakhawm, lampuiah a va feh a; chun, ngai ta, ama chu a um ta nawh a. Anih, ka zawng a, nisienla- khawm, hmu zo a ni ta nawh."
"Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a happy end to the man of peace.","Mi demkailo inchik la, mi indiktak chu en rawh, Chuong ang mi tâwpna ding chu lungmuongna a ni ding a ni sih a."
"As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together: The end of the wicked shall be cut off.","Bawsetuhai ruok chu a ruola suksietin an um tâwl ding a na, Mi rilohai tâwpna ding chu sukbohmangna ning a tih."
But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.,Mi felhai sandamna ruok chu LALPA kuoma inthawk a ni a. Ama chu lunginzîng laia an kulbîng a ni hlak a.
"And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them: He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.","LALPAIN anni chu a ṭhangpuiin a sanhim hlak a, Amaa chun an tlûklût leiin; Mi rilohaia inthawk chun a sanhimin a sandam hlak."
"O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.","Aw LALPA, lunginsenin mi kâwk naw la, Lunginsenin mi thunun bawk naw rawh."
"For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore.","I thalhai chu ka pangah ân bûr tlat a, I kutin a mi nam ngâwi ngâwi sih a."
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.,"I lungninawna leiin ka taksaa hin dam lai hrim hrim a um nawh a, Ka suolna leiin ka ruahai hin hrisêl lai hrim a um bawk nawh."
For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.,"Ka rîtlonahai chun ka lu hi a chîm hmang a, Phur riktak ang ka zo ruol lo hi a nih."
"My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness.","Kân vêtna leiin, Ka pawpnahai hi a hmawnin a khawhlo zo tah a."
I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.,"Ka nah a, ka kûn rawng rawng a, Sûnnithlâkin lungngaiin kân vêl ruoi hlak."
For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.,"Ka kâwng hi a sa vut vut zing a, Ka taksaa khawm hin dam lai hrim a um nawh."
I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.,"Ka chau a, ka sil ûr a, Ka lungril inhawi nawna leiin kân rûm rak rak a,"
"Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee.","LALPA, ka dit zâwng po po hi i hmaah a um vawng a; Kân rûm khawm hi i kuoma chun thup a ni nawh."
"My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.","Ka lung hi ân lap dawr dawr a, thahrui ka nei ta nawh a, Ka mit varna hlak chun a mi um naw san ta bawk a,"
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.,"Mi hmangaituhai le ka ruolhai chu ka hri invawia inthawk hin an insiekieng hlak a, Ka laibunghai khawm hlatakah an ngîr hlak."
"They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long.","Ka hringna sukbo tuma zawngtuhai chun an mi âwkna dingin chânghai an kam hlak a, Ka sietna ding zawngtuhai khawm chun thu ṭha nawtakhai an hril a, Sûnnithlâkin hlêmna thuhai an ngaituo hlak."
"But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chu mi nasêt angin hre loin ka um a, Ṭawngtheilo bau ka ngailo angin ka um a."
"Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs.","Anih, mi ṭawng hre theilo, A baua hrângna thu hrim suok ngailo angin ka um."
"For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.","Aw LALPA, nangma ka beisei si cheh a, Aw LALPA ka Pathien, nangin mi dawn i tih."
"For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.","“Chuong naw chun mi diriem an ta, Ka ke ân tlêu phingleh ka chungah insuklien rawi an tih,” ka ti a nih."
"For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me.","Kân bai vâng vâng sih a, Ka lungngaina khawm ka hmaah a um rawp a nih."
For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.,"Ka rîtlona chu ka phuong a, Ka suolna leia lungngaiin ka um a."
"But mine enemies are lively, and are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.","Nisienlakhawm, a mi dotuhai chu an thothâng a ṭhain, an hrât a, Indiknawtaka a mi theidatuhai chu an pung ta huk a."
"They also that render evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.","Thil ṭha thil suola thung hlak- tuhai hi, Thil ṭha ka hnawt leiin a mi dotuhai an nih."
"Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be not far from me.","Aw LALPA, mi fesan lul naw la, Aw ka Pathien, mîn hlat lul naw rawh."
"Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.","Aw LALPA, a mi sandamtu, A mi ṭhangpui dingin inhmaw rawh."
"I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.","Ka lei hin thil ka suksuol nawna dingin, Ka umdânhai hi vêng ṭhang ka ta; Mi rilohai ka hmaha an um sûng po, Ka bau hi hmûrkhitnain khit ka tih, ka tih a."
"I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.","Chuongchun, to zingin ṭawng loin ka um a, A ṭha tienga khawm ka to zing a; Nisienlakhawm, ka lungngaina chu chawkthoin a um lem hman a."
My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned; Then spake I with my tongue:,"Ka phîng sûnga hin ka lungril chu a sa vut vut a; Ka ngaituo ka ngaituo chun mei chu a chawk suok a; Chun, ka lei hin thu ka hril tah a."
"Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.","“LALPA, ka tâwpna ding le ka dam chen ding chu, Iengtin am a na ti mîn hriettir la, Ka derdêpzie hi mîn hriettir rawh”."
"Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. [Selah","Ngai ta, ka dam chen hi kut- pha bawk chen chauin i siem a, Ka kum hi i mithmua chun ieng khawp khawm a ni nawh a; Mi tin an ṭhat lai tak khawmin an pumin iengkhawm an ni nawh."
"Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.","Mi tin hi hlim angin an lêng takmeu a, An buoi thlâwn takmeu a nih. Ro ân khâwl khâwm hlak a, a hluotu ding a hriet si nawh a."
"And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.","Chun, LALPA, tuhin ieng am a na ka nghâk chu? Nangmaah a nih ka beiseina a um chu."
Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish.,"Ka bawsietna po poa inthawkin mi sansuok la, Mi invêt hrilsietin mîn umtir naw rawh."
"I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it.","Nangma thaw a ni leiin, Ka ṭawng nawh a, ka bau ka ka bawk nawh."
Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.,"I mi vuokna hi ka kuoma inthawkin mi la hmangpêk la, I kutthlâka sukbohmang ka ni hi."
"When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. [Selah","Mi a bawsietna leia kâwknahaia i thunun hin, A ditumna hi hângthim angin i suksiet hlak: Mi tin hi iengkhawm an ni nawh."
"Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.","Aw LALPA, ka ṭawngṭâina hi ngai la, ka konaa hin na sit la, Ka mitthli tla hi tosan naw rawh: I mikhuol ka na, A mi thlatuhai po po ang khan khuolchâm el ka ni sih a."
"Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go hence, and be no more.","Aw, hitaka ka suok a, ka um naw sawng dai hma hin, Ka har nâwkna dingin mi hla rawh."
"Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.","Aw ka felna Pathien, ka ko pha che chun mi hung dawn la, Ka lunginzîng chun nangin i mi sukthawveng hlak a: Mi lunginsiet la, ka ṭawngṭâina hi mi ngaipêk la."
"O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? [Selah","Aw mihriem nauhai, ka ropuina hi ieng chen am muolphonaah in inchan ding a na? Iengchen am thil teplo hi ngainâng in ta, khêlthu hi in zawng ding?"
But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.,LALPA chun Pathien ngaisak mi chu ama ta dingin a sie tum ti hi hre lem ro: LALPA chun ka ko po leh ngai a tih.
"Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. [Selah","Ṭi unla, thil suksuol naw ro; In khumlaizâwla chun in lungrilah inngaituo unla, to ṭhiep ro."
"Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah.","Felna inthâwinahai chu inhlân unla, LALPAA chun ringna innghat ro."
"Many there are that say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.",“Ṭhatna hrim hrim tuin am min hmutir a ti leh?” tituhai chu tamtak an um. LALPA nang ngeiin i hmêl var khan mi hang ên rawh.
"Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.","Ka lungrila chun lâwmna i sie tah a, An bu le an uoin hung hlâwk chânga lâwmna an nei nêka nasa lem chu."
"In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.","Lungmuongtakin zâl ka ta, in ka tih: LALPA nang ngei hi i nih, makhât chau khawma him- taka mîn umtir hlaktu chu."
"I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.","LALPA chu ka nghâk fan fan a, Chuongchun, ama chu ka kuom tieng a hung thleh a, Ka ko chu a ngai tah a."
"He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.","Bohmangna khura inthawkin, chirhak inhnâktaka inthawk chun a mi khai suok tah a: Chun, ka ke chu lungpui chungah ân nghat a, ka ke pênhai chu a sukdet a."
"And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust in Jehovah.","Hla thar ka bauah a sie ta bawk a, ei Pathien inpâkna chu: Mi tamtakin chuong chu hmûng an ta, ṭî bawk an ta; LALPA chu ring tâng an tih."
"Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust, And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.","LALPA chu a ringsana nei a, Chapohai le khêl tienga pêthai ngaisaklo mi chu, a hamṭha ie;"
"Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward: They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, nangin thilmak i thawhai le, Keini tieng i ngaituonahai hi a tam bêk bêk a, Chuong chu i hmaa suklang sêng ruol a ni nawh a, Inhriettirin hril ding ni lang, Ṭiemsêng ruol ni naw ni."
Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.,Inthâwina le thilinhlân chunga hin lâwmna hrim i nei nawh a: Ka nahai hi i mi sukvarpêk tah a; Pumrawhmanga thilinhlân le suol ta dinga thilinhlân chu i phût nawh.
"Then said I, Lo, I am come; In the roll of the book it is written of me:","Chu phingle chun keiin, “Ngai ta, ka hung ie, Lekhabu ziela chun ka thu ziek a nih:"
"I delight to do thy will, O my God; Yea, thy law is within my heart.","Aw ka Pathien, i dit zâwng thaw hi ka lâwm zâwng tak a nih: Anih, i dân thu chu ka lungril- ah a um zing ie,” ka ta."
"I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Jehovah, thou knowest.","Inkhâwmna ropuitaka chun felna chanchin ṭha ka khêkpui a, Aw LALPA, ngai ta, Ka bau hi inro naw ning ti i hriet deh."
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.,"I felna chu ka lungril sûngah ka ip nawh a; I ringumna le i sandamna thu chu ka khêkpui lem a, I ngilneina le i takna chu inkhâwmpui ropuitaka mi- hai kuoma chun ka thup nawh a."
"Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.","Aw LALPA, i lainatnahai chu ka kuomah inro naw la, I ngilneina le i takna chun mi humhim rawp raw se."
"For innumerable evils have compassed me about; Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed me.","Thil ṭha naw tiem sêng lo chun an mîn huolvêl sih a, Ka rîtlonahai chun an mi hnawt phâk a; Chuongchun, ka dâk thei ta nawh a; Chuong chu, ka samzaihai nêk hin a tam lem a, ka lungril hi a châu tah a."
"Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.","Aw LALPA, lunginsiettakin mi sanhim la, Aw LALPA, mi ṭhangpui dingin inhmaw rawh."
Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.,"Ka hringna sukbo tuma zawngtuhai chu, Muolphotak le inzaktakin um tâwl hai sienla, Ka sietna chunga lâwmhai chu, Innghatkîrtirin sukzakin um raw hai se."
"Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say unto me, Aha, aha.","“Chei! Chei!” mi tituhai chu, An muolpho leiin lunginzîng- takin um raw hai se."
"Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified.","A zawngtuhai po po che chu nangmaa chun hlimtak le lâwmtakin um hai sienla, I sandamna ngainatuhai chun, “LALPA chu chawimawiin um raw se,” ti rawp raw se."
"But I am poor and needy; Yet the Lord thinketh upon me: Thou art my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God.","Kei chu rimsi le pasetak ka nih, Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN a mi ngaituo hlak. Nang chu a mi ṭhangpuitu le a mi sandamtu i na; Aw ka Pathien, sâwt riel lul naw raw khai."
Blessed is he that considereth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.,"Rimsihai ngaituo mi chu mi hamṭha a nih, Lunginzîng ni chun ama chu LALPAIN sanhim a tih."
"Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, And he shall be blessed upon the earth; And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies.","LALPAIN ama chu humhimin sukhring a ta, hnuoia hin malsâwmin um a tih; Nangin ama dotuhai nuom nuoma an thaw dingin pe naw ti ni."
Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing: Thou makest all his bed in his sickness.,"LALPAIN a chauna zâlhmuna chun sukhrât a ta, Nangin a damnaw laiin a zâlna siempêk vawng i tih,"
"I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me: Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.","Keiin, “Aw LALPA, mi lungin- siet la, Ka hringna hi sukdam la, i chungah thil ka suksuol sih a,” ka tih a."
"Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?","A mi dotuhai chun, “Iengtik am thîng a ta, a hming bo a ti aw?” tiin, An mi hrilsiet hlak a."
"And if he come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: When he goeth abroad, he telleth it.","Chun, anni laia tuin amanih a mi hung kan hlakin, thu teplo mei mei a hril hlak a; A lungril chun suolna a lâk khâwm hlak a, A fe suok phingleh mi a hril hlak."
All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise my hurt.,"A mi theidatuhai po po chun an mi hêkna thu se sein an lâk a, A mi suksietna ding an ngaituo hlak."
"An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.","“Natna ṭha nawtakin a tlâkkhum tah a, Tuta a zâl hi tho nawk ta naw nih,” an ta."
"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me.","Anih, ka ruol pâwlngei, ka ringtak, ka bei fâkpui ngei chun, A kekhawng chu ka chungah ân let tah a."
"But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, That I may requite them.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA,nangin mi lunginsiet la, Anni chu ka thung theina dingin mi keitho nâwk rawh."
"By this I know that thou delightest in me, Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.","Hitaka hin ka chungah, i lâwm ti ka hriet, A mi dotu chun a mi hne ngai naw leiin."
"And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, And settest me before thy face for ever.","Kei chu lungril ṭhatak ka putnaa hin nangin i mi chel zing a, I hmaa chun kumkhuoa dingin i mi sieh a."
"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.","LALPA, Israel Pathien chu, Chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin inpâkin um raw se, Amen, Amen."
"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my soul after thee, O God.","Sakhi vadungte tui châka ân thuok hlawp hlawp angin, Aw Pathien, ka hringna hi nangma châkin ân thuok hlawp hlawp a nih."
"My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God?","Ka hringna hi, Pathien châkin, Pathien hring châkin a dangchâr a nih: Iengtik am Pathien hma tlung ka ta, inlang ka tih aw?"
"My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?","Ka mitthli hi asûn azânin ka bu a nih, “Khâwlai am i Pathien teh?” an mi lo ti zawmzawt a."
"These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.","Hieng thil hi ka hriet zing a, ka hringna hi ka sûngah ka bunthlâk a, Mipui laia ka feh a, hlimna le inpâkna ri leh, mi tamtak ruoiṭhe, Pathien biekin pana an hma ka ṭhuoi hlakzie ang dâm kha."
"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him For the help of his countenance.","Aw ka hringna, iengdinga i kûn zing am? Iengdinga ka sûnga hin i buoi am a na? Pathien beisei rawh, a hmêla damna lei chun, Ama chu ka lân pâk ding a ni sih a."
"O my God, my soul is cast down within me: Therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.","Aw ka Pathien, ka hringna ka sûnga hin a kûn zing a: Chuleiin, Jordan le Hermon rama inthawk dâm, Mizar tlânga inthawk dâm hin ka hriet zing che a nih."
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.,"I tui luong ri dur durahai hin tui inthûk le tui inthûk chu an inko a, I tuifâwn le i tui insawk po po chun a mi chîm tlum tah."
"Yet Jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the day-time; And in the night his song shall be with me, Even a prayer unto the God of my life.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN a ngilneina chu sûnah thu pêng a ta, A hla chun zânah mi umpui a tih, Ka hringna Pathien kuoma ṭawngṭaina chun."
"I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?","Pathien ka lungpui kuoma chun, “Iengdinga i mi theinghil am? Iengdinga a mi dotuhai nêksâwrna leia lungngaia kân vâi ruoi hlak am a na?” tîng ka tih."
"As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?",Ru inlang râwtin a mi dotu- hai chun an mi hrilsiet hlak a. “Khâwlai am i Pathien teh?” an mi lo ti zawmzawt a.
"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.","Aw ka hringna, iengdinga i kûn zing am? Iengdinga ka sûnga hin i buoi am a na? Pathien beisei rawh, ama chu ka lân pâk ding a ni sih a. Ka hmêl sukmawitu le ka Pathien chu."
"Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.","Aw Pathien ro mi rêlpêk la, Pathien ngaisak naw hnam chunga hin ka thu mi hrilpêk rawh; Aw, mi hlêmhmang mi indik nawa inthawk hin mi sanhim rawh."
For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?,"Nang chu ka hrâtna Pathien i ni sih a, iengdinga i mi ngaitha am a na? Iengdinga a mi dotu nêksâwrna leia lungngaia kân vâi ruoi hlak am a na?"
"Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me: Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, And to thy tabernacles.","Aw, i var le i thutak chu tir suok la, anni chun mi ṭhuoi sienla, I tlâng inthieng le, I umna chu mîn tlun raw se."
"Then will I go unto the altar of God, Unto God my exceeding joy; And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.","Chuongchun, Pathien mâichâm kâwlah fêng ka ta, Pathien ka hlimna bêk bêk kuoma chun: Aw Pathien, ka Pathien, ṭingṭangin inpâk bawk ka ti che."
"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.","Aw ka hringna, iengdinga i kûn zing am? Iengdinga ka sûnga hin i buoi am a na? Pathien beisei rawh, ama chu ka lân pâk ding a ni sih a. Ka hmêl sukmawitu le ka Pathien chu."
"We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work thou didst in their days, In the days of old.","Aw Pathien, tienlaia an dam laia i thilthawhai kha. Kan thlatuhaiin an mi hril, kan nain kan hriet,"
Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But them thou didst spread abroad.,"Nangin i kutin hnam tin chu i hnawt suok a, anni chu i phun ta thung a, Mi tin chu i sukrimsih a, anni chu în zârlientir thung a."
"For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast favorable unto them.","Ram chu hluo dinga anni kâwl- hnâma an lâk a ni nawh a, Anni bâna insandam an ni bawk nawh; An chunga i lâwm leiin, I kut changtieng le, i bân le i hmêl varin a ni lem."
"Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.","Aw Pathien, nang chu ka Lal i nih, Jakob sanhimna dingin thu pe rawh."
Through thee will we push down our adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.,"Nangma leiin a mi dotuhai chu sikthlûng kan ta, I hming leiin a mi thawtuhai chu chîl hrep kan tih."
"For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me.","Ka thalngul hi ka ring âwm si nawh a, Ka kâwlhnâm hin mi sandam bawk naw ni."
"But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.","A mi dotuhaia inthawk chun nangin i mi sandam ta lem a, A mi theidatuhai chu i sukmuolpho ta bawk a."
"In God have we made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. [Selah","Sûnnithlâkin Pathien kan sawng a, I hming chu kumkhuoin inpâk bawk kan tih."
"But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonor, And goest not forth with our hosts.","Tu ruok hin chu nangin i mi ngaitha a, i mi sukzak a, Kan sipai ruol lai hlak i suok ve ngai nawh a,"
Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.,"A mi dotuhaia inthawk chun i mîn tlânsiettir hlak a, A mi theidatuhai chun sum chu an nuom nuomin an lâk hlak."
"Thou hast made us like sheep appointed for food, And hast scattered us among the nations.","Nangin fâk dinga ruot berâm angin i mi pêk a, Hnam tin lai chun i mi sukdar bawk a."
"Thou sellest thy people for nought, And hast not increased thy wealth by their price.","I mihai hi iengkhawm niloah i zawr a, An man chu i hausakpui chuong si nawh."
"Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.","Nangin kan vêla mihai hrilsietin i mîn umtir a, Kan dep vêla mihai hmusit le nuisanin i mîn umtir bawk a."
"Thou makest us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.","Nangin hnam tin lai chun a se tieng hrilkhinaah i mîn umtir a, Mi tin laia mihai lu thinkhum- in i mîn umtir bawk a."
"All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,","Kân zakna hi sûnnithlâkin ka hmaah a um hlak a, Ka muolphona hin a mîn khum zo tah,"
"For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.","Hrilhnuoltu le hrilsetu râwl lei le, Hmêlma le phubalatu leiin,"
"All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.","Chuong po po chu kan chungah a tlung a; nisienlakhawm, kan theinghil ngai naw cheh a; I thuthlunga hin a tehlêmin kan thaw ngai bawk nawh."
"Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from thy way,","Kan lungril hi a nghakîr nawh a, Kan ke pênhai hin i lampui chu a pêtsan ngai bawk nawh."
"That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.","Nangin sihalhai umnaa mi sawisa hrepa, Thina deihlima an mi khumna dingin."
"If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;","Kan Pathien hming chu theinghilin, Ram dang pathien tienga kan kuthai kan phar chun amanih,"
Will not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.,Pathienin chu chu a zawng suok naw ding am a nih? Lungril thup rûkhai hi a hriet zing sih a.
"Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.","Anih, nangma leiin sûnni- thlâka thatin kan um hlak a, Berâm that dinghai anga ngai kan nih."
"Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, cast us not off for ever.","Aw LALPA, har ta la, ieng- dinga i in am? Meng la, kumkhuo chun mi ngaitha naw."
"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?","Iengleiin am i hmai i thup a, Kan rinumzie le nêksâwr kan tuorzie hi i theinghil hlak chu?"
For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body cleaveth unto the earth.,"Kan hringna hi pilvut sikin a kûn a, Kan phîng hlak hnuoiah a kawp tlat sih a."
"Rise up for our help, And redeem us for thy lovingkindness’ sake.","Mi ṭhangpui dingin tho la, I ngilneina lei chun mi sansuok rawh."
My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made touching the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.,Ka lungril hi thil ṭhain a liem zar zar a; Laltak chungchâng thuha ka thil phuok chu ka hril ding a nih: Ka lei hi lekhaziek thiemtak kawlawm a nih.
Thou art fairer than the children of men; Grace is poured into thy lips: Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.,"Mihriem nauhai nêk hin i hmêl a ṭha lem a, Lunginsietna hi i hmûra chun buok a nih; Chuleiin, Pathienin kumkhuoa dingin mal a sâwm che a nih."
"Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty.","Aw mi hrât, i kâwlhnâm i kâwngah vawng rawh. I ropuina le i mawina leh."
"And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, Because of truth and meekness and righteousness: And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.","Thutak le thuhnuoirawlna le felna leiin, I mawina inbelin, aitluongtakin sakawr chunga chuongin fe pei rawh. Chuongchun, i kut changtieng chun thil râpthlâktakhai ân chûktir ding che a nih."
Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under thee; They are in the heart of the king’s enemies.,"I thal chu ân zum a, Laltak dotuhai lungkhura chun ân bûr zing a, Mi tin chu i hnuoiah an tlu hlak a."
"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.","Aw Pathien, i lalṭhungpha chu chatuonin a um ding a nih, Thlierbîkna nei lona lalhmawl chu i ram lalhmawl chu a nih."
"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.","Felna chu i ngainah a, rîtlona chu i theida kha; Chuleiin, Pathien, i Pathien chun i ruolhai nêka nasain, Hlimna hriek a nâl ta che hi."
"All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.","I silfên po po chu murra rim dâm, aloe rim dâm, thing- zungthak rim dâm ân nam rum rum a; Saihaa siem lal inhaia ṭingṭang chi tum tum ri hung suokhai chun a sukhlim che a ni hi."
Kings’ daughters are among thy honorable women: At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.,"I nuhmei ṭhahai laia chun lalhai naunuhai an ṭhang veh a, I changtieng chun Ophir rângkachaka incheiin lalnu chu a ngîr a."
"Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house:","Aw ka naunu, ngai la, ngaituo la, na sit rawh; I mihai le i pa ina mihai chu theinghil rawh;"
So will the king desire thy beauty; For he is thy lord; and reverence thou him.,"Chuongchun, laltakin i hmêl ṭhatak hi a dit ding annâwm, Ama chu i Lalpa a ni sih a; chuongchun, ama chu chibai bûk hlak rawh."
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.,"Tura naunu chu thilpêk chawi- in chutaka chun um a ta, Mi laia hausahai ngei chun i ditsakna hung ngên an tih."
The king’s daughter within the palace is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold.,"Lal in sûnga lal naunu chu a ropui vêl vawng a, A silfên chu rângkachaka ṭiel mawi a nih."
She shall be led unto the king in broidered work: The virgins her companions that follow her Shall be brought unto thee.,"Puon ṭhui mawi silin laltak kuomah ṭhuoi an ta, Ama zuitu nunghâk a ruolhai chu, I kuomah ṭhuoi an tih."
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: They shall enter into the king’s palace.,"Lâwmtak le hlimtakin ṭhuoi an ta, Laltak ina chun lût an tih."
"Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.","I pahai aiah i nauhai um an ta, Anni chu hnuoi chung po poa hin milienah siem i tih."
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: Therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever.,"I hming hi suon po poa hriet zing dingin siem ka ta, Chuleiin, mi tinin kumkhaw- tluongin lâwmthu hril an tih."
"God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.","Pathien chu ei inhumhimna le ei hrâtna, Lunginzîng laia ṭhangpui vartu hnai zing a nih."
"Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas;","Chuleiin, leilung hi hung danglamin, Tlânghai hi tuisuoriet sûng daiah insawn sien khawm ṭi nâwng ei ta;"
"Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. [Selah","A tuihai chu inri hum humin, so bur bur sienla khawm, A fâwn nasa leiin tlânghai hi inhnîng dur dur sien khawm ṭi chuong bawk nâwng ei tih."
"There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.","Vadung pakhat a um a, chu kau chun Pathien khawpuihai chu a suklâwm hlak, Achunghnungtak umna hmun inthieng chu."
"God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God will help her, and that right early.","Pathien chu a lai takah a um a, inhnîng naw nih a, Pathienin khawfingchat pha chun ṭhangpui a tih."
"The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted.","Hnam tin an inri hum hum a, ramhai chu ân hnîng a, Ama chun a râwl ân suoh a, leihnuoi hi ân tui zo tah a."
Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. [Selah,"Sipaihai LALPA chu ei kuomah a um a, Jakob Pathien chu ei kulbîng insâng a nih."
"Come, behold the works of Jehovah, What desolations he hath made in the earth.","Hung unla, LALPA thilthawhai hi en ta u, Leihnuoia thil a suksietziehai hi."
"He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire.","Ama chun indonahai chu kâwlkawdawng chenin a sukbo hlak a, Thalngul chu a sukthliek a, fei chu a sât bawng hlak a. Tawlailîrhai chu meiah a raw hmang hlak."
"Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.","To unla, Pathien ka nih ti hi hre ro, Hnam tin lai chawimawiin um ka ta, hnuoia hin chawimawiin um ka tih."
Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. [Selah,"Sipaihai LALPA chu ei kuomah a um a, Jakob Pathien chu ei kulbîng insâng a nih."
"Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.","Aw mi tinrênghai, in kut ben unla, Hlimna râwlin Pathien kuomah khêk ro."
For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth.,LALPA Achunghnungtak chu ṭi a um sih a. Hnuoi chung po poah Lal ropuitak a nih.
"He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet.","Ama chun mi tin chu ei hnuoiah tukdawl a ta, Hnam tin chu ei ke hnuoiah tukdawl bawk a tih."
"He chooseth our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved. [Selah","Ama chun ei rohluo ding chu mi thlangpêk a ta, A hmangai Jakob sawngtak ram chu."
"God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.","Pathien chu khêkri leh a hang feh a, LALPA chu tawtawrâwt ri leh a hang fe tah."
"Sing praises to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.","Pathien inpâkin hla sak unla, inpâkin sak ro, Ei Laltak inpâkna hla sak unla, inpâkin sak ro."
For God is the King of all the earth: Sing ye praises with understanding.,"Pathien chu khawvêl po po Lal a ni sih a, Hrethiema inpâkin hla sak ro."
God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne.,"Pathien chu hnam tin chungah Lalah a ṭhung a, Pathien chu lalṭhungpha inthienga chun a ṭhung a,"
The princes of the peoples are gathered together To be the people of the God of Abraham; For the shields of the earth belong unto God: He is greatly exalted.,"Mi tin laia milienhai chu an um khâwm a, Abraham Pathien mihai ni dingin; Leihnuoi phawhai chu Pathien ta a ni sih a, Ama chu nasataka chawimawiin a um a nih."
"Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.","LALPA chu a ropui a, nasataka inpâk ding a nih; Ei Pathien khawpuiah, a tlâng inthienga chun."
"Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, The city of the great King.","Insâng zâwnga mawitak, khawvêl po po hlimna chu, Zion tlâng chu a nih, hmar tieng panga, Lal ropuitak khawpui chu."
God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.,A lal inahai chun Pathien chun kulbîng insâng a nizie ân hriettir a.
"For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.","Ngai ta, lalhai chu an pung khâwm a, An fe tlâng tah a nih."
"They saw it, then were they amazed; They were dismayed, they hasted away.","An hmuh a; chuongchun, mak an tih a, An lunginzîng a, an tlân hmang ta vak a."
"Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail.","Chutaka chun inthinnain a man a, Nuhmei nau invawi natna angin a man bawk a."
With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.,"Khawsak thliin, Tarsis lawnglienhai chu i suksiet a."
"As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. [Selah","Sipaihai LALPA khawpuiah, ei Pathien khawpuia chun, Naa ei hriet ang ngeiin ei hmu tah; Pathienin chu khawpui chu kumkhuoa dingin sukdet a tih."
"We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of thy temple.","Aw Pathien, i biekin sûng rila chun, I ngilneizie hi kan ngaituo tah."
"As is thy name, O God, So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full of righteousness.","Aw Pathien, i hming ang ngeiin, Nangma inpâkna chu kâwlkaw- dawng chenin a um a; I kut changtieng chu felnain a sip a nih."
"Let mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of thy judgments.","I rorêlhai leiin, Zion tlâng chu lâwmtakin um sienla, Juda naunuhai chu hlimtakin um raw se."
"Walk about Zion, and go round about her; Number the towers thereof;","Zion chu vêlin fe huol unla, A râlvêng in insânghai khawm chu tiem ro."
Mark ye well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces: That ye may tell it to the generation following.,"A kulhai chu inchik ngun unla, A lal inhai chu ngaituo ro; Ruolthar hung um nâwkhai kuoma in hril theina dingin."
For this God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our guide even unto death.,"Hi Pathien hi kumkhawtluonga ei Pathien a ni ding a ni sih a, Thi chen khawma a mi ṭhuoitu ning a tih."
"Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,","Mi tinrênghai, hi hi ngai unla, Khawvêla um po pohai na lo sit ro."
"Both low and high, Rich and poor together.","Mi chîn le mi lien, Mi hausa le mi rimsi khawmin,"
My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.,"Ka bau hin varna thu hril a ta, Ka lungril ngaituo chu hrietthiemna thu nîng a tih."
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.,"Tekhithuah ka na sit ka ta, Ka thu ril hril chu ṭingṭangin hrilfieng ka tih."
"Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?","Ni ṭha nawahai, ka kekhawng bulah rîtlona chun a mîn huolvêl khawmin, Iengdingin am ṭîng ka ta?"
"They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;","Mâni sum ring a, Mâni hausakna nasatak suongtuhai chun,"
"None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him","Tukhawmin an unau khawm intlan thei tawp naw nih a, Pathien kuomah intlanna pe pêk thei bawk naw ni hai:"
"(For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever),","An hringna intlanna ding chun thil nasatak sêng ding a na, Kumkhuo khawma a tina tin naw el ding a nih:"
"That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption.","A dam zing a, Hmawnna a hmu nawna ding chun."
"For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.","Mi varhai khawm an thih a, Mi invêt le mi ngawnghai khawm an bohmang ve veh a, An sum mi danghai an mâksanpêk hlakhai chu an hriet sih a."
"Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.","An lungril ngaituo dân chu, An inhai chu kumkhuoa um ding ang le, An umnahai chu suon po po chena um ding ang a nih. An ramhai chu anni hming ruok an inputtir hlak."
But man being in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish.,"Nisienlakhawm, mihriem hi chawimawiin an um zing nawh a. Sa bohmang hlakhai ang el hi an nih."
This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. [Selah,"Invêttaka mâni inringzohai chan, Mâni sumneia lungawi elhai tâwpna chu hi hi a nih:"
"They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd: And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it.","Berâm ruol angin Seol ta dinga ruot an na, Thina chu an vêngtu ning a ta, Zîngtieng chun mi indiktakhaiin an chungah thu nei an ta, An umna hrim hrim a um nawna dingin, an mawina chu Seol suksiet ding nîng a tih."
But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. [Selah,"Ka hringna ruok chu Pathienin Seola inthawkin intlan suok a tih, Ama chun a mi lâwm âwm sih a."
"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased:","Mi sukhausaka a hung um a, A sungkuo ropuina chu a hung nasat deu deu khawmin ṭi naw rawh:"
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.,"A thi pha chun iengkhawm a sawm naw ding a na, A ropuina chun a zui thlâk âwm si nawh a."
"Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself),","A dam laiin insukengthâwl sienla khawm, (A hlawtlingna leiin mi inpâk hlaw sien khawm)."
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.,"A thlatuhai suon kuomah fêng a tih, Iengtika khawm var hmu ta lo dinghai kuoma chun."
"Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.","Mihriem chawimawia uma, hrietthiemna nei si lo chu, Sa bohmang hlakhai ang el hi an nih."
"Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.","Aw LALPA, ka thua hin na lo sit la, Ka ngaituona hi lo ngaituo ta:"
"Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray.","Ka Lal le ka Pathien, ka khêkri hi lo ngai la, I kuoma ṭawngṭâi ka ni sih a."
"O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch.","Aw LALPA, zîngkâr chun ka râwl hi lo hre hlak i ta, Zîngkâr chun ka ṭawngṭâina chu i hmaa chun rêl fel diem ka ta, lo ngaiven hlak ka tih."
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.,Rîtlonaa lâwm hlak Pathien i ni si nawh a. Mi suol chu i kuom tlung naw ni hai.
The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.,"Mi uonghai chu i mithmuah ngîr thei naw ni hai a, Thil suol thawtuhai po po chu i theida hlak."
Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.,"Khêl hril hmanghai chu sukbohmang i ta, LALPAIN thisen insuo hmang le hlêm hmang mi chu a tirdak rieu hlak."
"But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chu, i ngilneina nasatak lei chun i inah hung lût ka ta, Ṭi pum chein i biekin inthieng tieng nghain chibai bûk hlak ka ti che."
"Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face.","Aw LALPA, ka hmêlmahai leiin, i felnain mi ṭhuoi la, I lampui chu ka hmaa hin suktluong rawh."
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.,An baua chun ringumna hrim hrim a um nawh a; An sûngril chu rîtlona ruok el a nih: An hnuk chu thlân inhawng a na; An leiin an inpâk tehlêm hlak.
"Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee.","Aw Pathien, annirawi hi thiemnaw inchangtir la. Anni remruotnahai ngei chu tlûk phâna dingin hmang raw hai se; An bawsietna tamtakhai lei hin nam suok la. I chungah an hel sih a."
"But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.","Nangmaa ringna innghattuhai po po chu nangmaa chun lâwm hai sienla, I humhim leiin kumkhuoin lâwmin khêk tâwl raw hai se: I hming ngainatuhai khawm chu nangmaa chun lâwmtakin um raw hai se."
"For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.","Mi fel chu mal i sâwm ding a ni sih a, Aw LALPA, ama chu phâw angin ditsaknain în huol vêl ding a nih."
"The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.","Iengkimthawthei, Pathien ngei, LALPA chun thu a hril a, Leihnuoi hi nisa suoknaa inthawka a tlâkna chenin a ko tah a."
"Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.","Mawi famkimna, Ziona inthawk chun, Pathien chu a var suok tah a."
"Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him.","Ei Pathien chu hung a ta, to zing naw nih: A hmatieng chun mei kâng dur dur a ta, A vêla chun thlipui nasatak hrâng bawk a tih."
"He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people:","A mihai ro a rêl theina dingin, Chungtieng vânhai le hnuoi hi ko a tih,"
"Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.","“Ka mi inthienghai, ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi khâwm ro, Ran thata inthâwia ka kuoma thu thlungtuhai chu,” tiin."
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. [Selah,"Chuongchun, vânhai khin a felna chu tlânginsampui a ta, Ama Pathien ngei chu rorêltu a ni sih a."
"Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, even thy God.","“Aw ka mihai, ngai ta u, thu ka hril ding a nih, Aw Israel, ngai ta, kân hriettir ding che a nih: Kei hi Pathien, i Pathien ngei chu ka ni hi,"
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.,"I inthâwinahai leiin kâwk naw ning chengah a, I pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu ka hmaah a um rân sih a."
"I will take no bullock out of thy house, Nor he-goats out of thy folds.","I ina inthawk chu bâwngchal hrim hrim la suok naw ning, I ran huona inthawkhai chun kêltehai khawm la suok bawk naw ning."
"For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle upon a thousand hills.","Ramhnuoia sa tinrênghai hi ka ta a ni sih a, Tlâng sâng khat lai chunga ran umhai khawm chu."
I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.,"Tlânga vate po po ka hriet vawng a, Ramsahai khawm hi ka ta a nih."
"If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.","Phîngṭâm lang khawm hril naw ning cheng a, Leihnuoi le a sûnga thil um po pohai hi ka ta a ni sih a."
"Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?","Bâwngchal sa ka fâkin, Kêl thisen ka dâwn ding am a nih?"
Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High;,"Pathien kuoma lâwmthu hril- na inthâwina inhlân lem la, I thutiem khawm Achunghnungtak kuomah hlen rawh."
"And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.","Chun, lunginzîng ni chun mi ko la, Sanhim ka ti che, chuongchun, nangin i mi chawimawi ding annâwm,” a tih a."
"But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth,","Mi rilo kuoma ruok chun Pathienin, “Ka thuruothai hrilsuok theina i nei am a nih? Annawleh, ka thuthlung hi iengtizieha i baua sâm am i ni a?"
"Seeing that thou hatest instruction, And castest my words behind thee?","Thunun i theidah a, Ka thuhai hi i hnungtieng i dehâwn pei sih a."
"When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers.","Inru i hmu chun i remtipui a, Uirepahai hlak în kawppui bawk hlak."
"Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit.","I bau hi suol kuomah i pêk a, I lei hin hlêmna a siem bawk hlak."
Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.,"Ṭhungpumin i unau i sawi- sêl a, Mâni nuhai naupasalhai ngei chu i hêk hlak."
"These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.","Chuong thil chu i thawh a; nisienlakhawm, ka to zing a; Chuongchun, nangma ang charah i mi ruot hlak a, Nisienlakhawm, kâwk ka ti cheh a, i mithmuah indawt peiin suklang ka tih."
"Now consider this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:","Nangni Pathien theinghiltuhai, hi hi ngaituo ta u khai! Chuong naw chun, keinâwi ka ti cheu a, nangni sanhimtu hrim an um âwm si nawh a."
Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way aright Will I show the salvation of God.,"Tukhawm lâwmthu hril inthawina inhlân taphawt chun a mi chawimawi hlak, Chun, a um dân takinningtaka vawngtu kuoma chun, Pathien sandamna inentir ka tih,” a tih a."
"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.","Aw Pathien, i zainêm ang peiin mi lunginsiet la, I lainatna nasatzie ang peiin ka bawsietnahai hi thaihmang rawh."
"Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.","Ka rîtlonahai hi mi sâwpfaipêk var la, Ka suol hi mi sâwpfaipêk rawh."
For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me.,"Ka bawsietnahai hi ka hriet ta sih a, Ka suol hi ka hmaah a um rawp hlak a nih."
"Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in thy sight; That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, And be clear when thou judgest.","I chungah, i chung chauah thil ka suksuol a, I mithmuah thil suol ka lo thaw tah a: Thu i hrilin thiem în changtir thei a, Ro i rêlin demkailo i ni theina dingin."
"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin did my mother conceive me.","Ngai ta, rîtlonaa inngîrin ka um a, Ka nuin suolin a mi vawn a,"
"Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts; And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom.","Ngai ta, sûngril tiengahai hin takna i dit hlak a, Chuongchun, ân lang naw tienga hin varna mîn hriettir i tih."
"Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.","Husopin mi sukfai la, chuong- chun, fai ka tih; Mi sâwpfai la, chuongchun, vûr nêkin vâr ka tih."
"Make me to hear joy and gladness, That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.","Hlimna lâwmna chu nain mîn hriettir la, I ru sukthliekhai hi a hlim theina dingin."
"Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all mine iniquities.","Ka suolnahaia inthawk hin i hmai thup la, Ka rîtlona po po hi thaihmang rawh."
"Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit within me.","Aw Pathien, keimaa hin lungril inthiengtak siem la, Ka sûnga hin thlarau indiktak siem thar nâwk rawh."
Cast me not away from thy presence; And take not thy holy Spirit from me.,"I kuoma inthawk hin mi peihâwn naw la, I Thlarau Inthieng hi mi lapêk naw rawh."
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; And uphold me with a willing spirit.,"I mi sandam hlimna chu mi pe nâwk la, Tiawina thlarauin mi chel zing la;"
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; And sinners shall be converted unto thee.,"Chuongchun, bawsetuhai chu i lampui chanchinhai inchûktir ka ta, Chuongchun, mi suolhai chu nanga tieng ngha nâwk an tih."
"Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.","Aw Pathien, nang ka sandamna Pathien, thisen insuonahaia inthawk chun mi sanhim rawh; Chuongchun, ka lei hin i felna thu hi hlimtakin hlaah sak a tih."
"O Lord, open thou my lips; And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.","Aw LALPA, nangin ka hmûr hi hawng la, Chuongchun, ka bau hin inpâkna chu ân hriettir ding annâwm."
For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it: Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.,Inthawina chungah lâwmna i nei si nawh a; chuong ni naw sien chu pêng ka tih; Pumrawhmanga thilinhlân chungah lungawina hrim i nei nawh.
"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.","Pathien dit zâwng inthawina chu thlarau lungriem ithlâk hi a na, Aw Pathien, lungril lungriem ithlâk le insîr ngawi ngawi hi hmusit naw ti nih."
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.,I dit zâwng takin Zion chungah thil ṭha thaw la. Jerusalem kul chu rem rawh.
"Then wilt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, In burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.","Chuongchun, felna inthawinahai chungah lâwmna nei tâng i ta, pum- rawhmang thilinhlân le pum- inhlân thil chunga chun: Chuongchun, i mâichâm chunga chun bâwngchalhai inhlân tâng an tih."
"Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endureth continually.","Aw mi hrât, iengdinga thil suksuol i sawng am a na? Pathien zaidamna chu a um zing hlak a nih."
"Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.","Thil suol tak thaw i suongtuo hlak a, I lei chu rêpvâw chem ngeitak ang a na, Khêlhlip a sâksuok hlak."
"Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. [Selah","Ṭhat nêkin suol i ngaina lem a, Thu indiktak hril nêkin khêlthu hril i ngaina lem bawk a."
"Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.","Aw, nang lei mi hlêmnghal, Thu mi lem zo thei po po chu i ngaina hlak."
"God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. [Selah","Pathien chun kumkhawtluonga dingin sukse vêng a ti che, Man a ti cheh a, i umnaa inthawkin kei dawk a ti cheh a, Mi hring rama inthawk hin kei suok dai a ti che."
"The righteous also shall see it, and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying,","Mi felhai khawmin an hmu chun ṭîng an ta, Nuisan an tih."
"Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.","“En ta u, hi mi hi a nih, Pathien a kulbînga siem nuom lo a, A hausakna nasatak ring lem a, A suolnaa insukhrât vei chu,” tiin."
"But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.","Kei ruok chu chu Pathien ina oliv thing inder hlut hlut ang ka na, Pathien zainêmna chu kum- khawtluongin ring ka tih."
"I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.","Chu chu i thaw leiin kumkhuoin lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, I mi inthienghai mithmua chun i hming chu nghâk zing ka tih, a ṭha sih a."
"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good.","Mi invêt chun a lungrilin, ““Pathien hrim a um nawh,” a ti hlak a; Tukhawm thil ṭha thaw hrim an um nawh. An se zo a, thil suol tirdakum- tak an thawh a;"
"God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.","Hrethiema Pathien zawng hrim hrim an um am? ti hmu dingin, Pathienin vâna inthawkin mi- hriem nauhai hi a zuk en a."
"Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.","An kîr nâwk ta seng a, pawrchetakin an lo um ta vawng a; Tukhawm thil ṭha thaw hrim an um nawh, pakhat bêk khawm an um dêr nawh."
"Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon God?","Thilsuol thawtuhai chun hriet hrim hrim an nei naw am a nih? Bei an fâk angin ka mihai an fâk zo vawng hlak a, Pathien hlak an ko ngai bawk nawh."
"There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them.",Ṭitna hrim hrim um nawnaa chun ṭi êm êmin an um a. Pathienin thaw tuma eptu che ruhai chu a sukdar ta sih a; Pathienin anni chu a pei thlâk leiin i sukmuolpho tah a.
"Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.","Israelhai sandamna chu Ziona inthawkin suok sienla chu aw! Pathien chun a mihai sala an um chu a ṭhuoi kîr nâwk pha chun, Chu pha chun Jakobrawi hlim tâng an ta, Israelrawi lâwm tâng an tih."
"Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might.","Aw Pathien, i hmingin mi sandam la, I hrâtnain ro mi rêlpêk rawh."
"Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.","Aw Pathien, ka ṭawngṭâina hi ngai la, Ka baua thu suokhaia hin na lo sit rawh."
"For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them. [Selah","Mi chapohai chun an mi thaw ta sih a, Mi nunrâwnghaiin ka hringna hi sukbo tumin an zawng bawk a; Pathien chu an hmaah an sie nawh."
"Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.","Ngai ta, Pathien chu a mi ṭhangpuitu a nih; LALPA chu ka hringna cheltuhai laia mi a nih."
He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.,Ama chun suolna chu ka hmêlmahai chungah thung a ta; Nangin i thutakna lei chun anni chu sukbohmang rawh.
"With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.","Mâni nuomthua thilinhlânin i kuomah inthâwi ka tih: Aw LALPA, i hming chu inpâk ka tih, a ṭha si a."
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.,Ka lunginzîngna po poa chun i mi sansuok ta sih a; A mi dotuhai chunga ka duthusam chen chu ka mitin a hmu tah a nih.
"Give ear to my prayer, O God; And hide not thyself from my supplication.","Aw Pathien, ka ṭawngṭainaa hin nâ lo sit la, Lunginsiet ka hninaa hin inthup naw rawh."
"Attend unto me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan,","Mi lo ngai la, mi hung dawn rawh. Ka lunginzîng leiin kân vêl ruoi a, kân rûm hlak;"
"Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast iniquity upon me, And in anger they persecute me.","A mi dotuhai ri lei le, Mi rilo hnesiena leihaiin. Anni chun suolnain an mîn hlumkhumin, Lunginsenin an mi suknawmna sih a."
My heart is sore pained within me: And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.,"Ka sûnga hin ka lungril a na êm êm a, Thina ṭiumhai chun an mi del a."
"Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.","Ṭitna le inthinnain an mi bawh a, Thlabârnain a mîn khum zo tah."
"And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then would I fly away, and be at rest.","Chuongchun, “Aw, vaṭhu anga thla nei ka va nuom de! Chuongchun, vuong dai ka ta, lungmuongtakin um ka tih."
"Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. [Selah","Ngai ta, hlatakah inlêng ka ta, Thlalêrah um ka ta,"
I would haste me to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest.,"Thli hrâttak le, thlipui hi, Inbîkna hmunah ka mâksan vak ding bah,” ka tih a."
"Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.","Aw LALPA, an lei chu suksiein sukthlêr la, Khawpuia chun inpâwngnêkna le inkhîkinkhalna ka hmu sih a."
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.,"A sûn a zânin khawpui chu kul tlângah an vêl an vêl a, A sûnga chun suolna le rinumna a um bawk a."
Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.,"Rîtlona a sûngah a um a, Hlêmna le zâwrna chun a kawtthlêr chu a suoksan ngai nawh."
For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:,"A mi hrilsetu chu hmêlma a ni si nawh a, Ni sienla chu ka tuor thei lem ding bah; Ka chunga insuklien chu a mi theidatu a ni bawk nawh a: Ni sienla chu kân bîkhmangsan ding bah."
"But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend.","Nisienlakhawm, nang, ka mi inangpui, Ka ruol, ka ruol pâwlngei i ni mieu sih a."
We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.,"Bau thlumtakin ei inbiek hlak a, Mipui laia chun Pathien biek inah ei lêng hlak kha."
"Let death come suddenly upon them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.","Thina an chungah hung tlung thut sienla, Khur sûnga chun a hringin fe thla raw hai se; Rîtlonahai chu an umnaa le an sûngahai an um sih a."
"As for me, I will call upon God; And Jehovah will save me.","Kei chun chu Pathien chu ko ka ta, Chuongchun, LALPAIN mi sandam a tih."
"Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.","Zântieng dâm, zîngkâr dâm, sûna dâm ka lunginzîngna thu hrilin inrûm ka ta: Chuongchun, ama chun ka râwl lo ngai a tih."
He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many that strove with me.,Ka chunga an mi thawnaa inthawk chun ka hringna hi lungmuongtakin a sanhim tah a; A mi thawtuhai chu an tam sih a.
"God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old, [Selah The men who have no changes, And who fear not God.","Pathien, tiena chena um zing ta chun, Ngai a ta, anni chu suktlâwm a tih. Danglamna nei ngailo, Pathien ṭî ngai si lohai chu."
He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.,"Ama le inremhai chunga chun a kut ân lêt a, A thuthlung chu a sukkhawhlo tah a."
"His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.","A bau chu nênetui kîng angin a tlawr a, A lungril ruok chu indona a ni sih a; A thuhai chu hriek nêkin ân nâl a, Nisienlakhawm, kawlhnâm phawisahai a ni sih a."
"Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.","I rikphur chu LALPA chunga innghat la; chuongchun, amain sukhrât a che, Mi fel chu iengtika khawm sukhnîng phal naw nih."
"But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in thee.","Nisienlakhawm, aw Pathien, nangin anni chu bohmang- na khura chun infe thlâktir i ta, Thisen insuo hmang ke le hlêm hmang mihai chu an dam sûng chenve khawm dam naw ni hai: Kei ruok chun nang chu ring ka ti che."
"Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.","Aw Pathien, mi lunginsiet la, mihriemin mi lem zo an tum sih a; Sûnnithlâkin an mi thawin an mi nêksâwr hlak."
Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me.,"Ka hmêlmahaiin sûnnithlâkin mi lem zo an tum a, Chapotaka mi thawtuhai hi an tam sih a."
"What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.","Ka ṭit châng po leh, Nangmaah ka ringna kân nghat a;"
"In God (I will praise his word), In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do unto me?","A thu ka inpâk Pathiena ngei chun. Pathien ka ring a, ṭi naw ningah; Tisa chun ieng am mi law thei a ta?"
All the day long they wrest my words: All their thoughts are against me for evil.,"Sûnnithlâkin ka thuhai an lâkkâwi hlak a, An ngaituo po po chu ka sietna ding ruok a nih."
"They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my soul.","An inkhâwm a, an inbihmang a, Ka hniekhnung an inchik hlak a, Ka hringna sukbo tumin an inchân a;"
"Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.","Suol pumin an pumpel ding am a nih? Aw Pathien, lunginsenin mi tin chu suktlâwm rawh."
Thou numberest my wanderings: Put thou my tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy book?,"Nangin kân vâkvainahai hi în chik hlak a, Ka mitthlihai hi i savun pênga chun thun la. I lekhabuah a chuong tâwl naw am a nih?"
"Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call: This I know, that God is for me.","Ka ko pha che chun a mi dotuhai chu tlânsieng an tih. Hi hi ka hriet, Pathienin a mi ṭan hi."
"In God (I will praise his word), In Jehovah (I will praise his word),","Pathiena chun a thu inpâk ka ta, LALPAA chun a thu inpâk ka tih."
"In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can man do unto me?","Pathien ka ring a, ṭi naw ningah, Mihriemin ieng am mi law thei an ta?"
"Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thank-offerings unto thee.","Aw Pathien, i kuomah thutiemhai ka nei a, Lâwmthu hrilna inthawina- haiin thung ka ti che."
"For thou hast delivered my soul from death: Hast thou not delivered my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?","Ka hringna hi thinaa inthawk i sanhim sih a, Ka kehai hi tlu lo dingin i sanhim a ni naw am a nih? Mi hring vara hin, Pathien hmaa ka lêng theina dingin."
"Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until these calamities be overpast.","Aw Pathien, mi lunginsiet rawh: Ka hringna hi nangmaa chun a hung tlulût sih a: Anih, i thla hnuoia chun himna zawng ka tih, Vângduoinahai hi ân kieng hmakhat chun."
"I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth all things for me.","Pathien Achunghnungtak chu ko ka ta, Pathien iengkim mi thawpêktu chu."
"He will send from heaven, and save me, When he that would swallow me up reproacheth; [Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.","Mi lem zo tumtu chun a mi hrilsiet pha chun, Ama chun vâna inthawkin hung tir a ta, mi sanhim a tih: Pathienin a ngilneina le a thutak hung tir suok a tih."
"My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.","Ka hringna hi sakeibaknei laiah a um a, Mihriem nauhai fa zo hmang- tuhai laia chun ka zâl a. Chuonghai hahai chu fei le thalhai an nih; An lei chu kâwlhnâm ngeitak a nih."
"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let thy glory be above all the earth.","Aw Pathien, nang chu vân khûm rak khin chawimawiin um la, I ropuina chu leihnuoi po po chunga hin hung um raw se."
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. [Selah,"Ka ke âwkna dingin lên an phah a, Ka hringna hi a tlep ngawi ngawi a, Ka hmaah khur an cho a, Anni ngei a lai takah an tla tah a."
"My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.","Ka lungril hi a det a nih, aw Pathien, ka lungril hi a det a nih: Hla sak ka tih, anih, inpâkna hla sak ka tih."
"Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.","Ka ropuina, har rawh, per- khuong le ṭingṭanghai, har ro: Kei chu zîngkâr har ka tih."
"I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.","Aw LALPA, mi tin laiahai chun lâwmthu hril ka ti che, Hnam tin laia chun nangma inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
"For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies.",I ngilneina chu vân tawng khawpin a nasa sih a. I thutakna chu vân dum tawng khawpin a nasa bawk a.

"Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?","Aw rorêltuhai, felna thu maw in hril tak tak? Aw mihriem nauhai, indiktakin maw ro in rêl?"
"Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.","Anih, in lungrila chun thil suoltak in thaw hlak a; Hnuoia in kuta thil nunsetaka thaw chu in bûk hlak a."
"The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.",Mi rilohai chu an nu phîng sûnga inthawk hrimin Pathiena inthawka ṭhein an um a; An pieng phingleh khêlthu hrilin an invâk hmang hlak.
"Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,","An tûr chu rûl tûr ang a na, Rulrîel nasêt, a na hip hlak ang chu an nih."
"Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely.",Chu chun rûl dawiinvêt theihai râwl chu a ngai nawh a; Ieng anga thiem khawmin dawi hai sien khawm.
"Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.","Aw Pathien, an baua chun an hahai chu suktlam la, Aw LALPA, sakeibaknei vânglaihai ha lientak takhai chu khel dawk la,"

"Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away, Like the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun.","Kawngkawrawi, intui a, bo el hlak ang hi ni sienla: A hun nawha nuhmei nau nei, nisa hmêl hrim hrim hmu lo ang hi ni raw se."

The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;,"Mi fel chun phubalâkna chu a hmuin lâwm a ta, Mi rilo thisena chun a ke chu sâwp a tih."
"So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.","Chuongchun, mihaiin, “Mi fel ta ding chun lâwmman a lo um tak tak a; Hnuoia hin rorêltu Pathien a lo um tak tak a ni hi,” tîng an tih."

"Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men.","Thil suksuoltuhai laia inthawkin mi sanhim la, Thisen insuo hmanghaia inthawkin mi sandam rawh."
"For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.","Aw LALPA, ka bawsietna lei ni loin, ka suol lei khawm ni bawk loin, Ngai ta, ka hringna hi an inchân zing sih a, Mi hrâthai chu a mi thaw dingin an pungkhâwm a nih."
"They run and prepare themselves without my fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold.","Ka suol naw sa khawmin an tlân a, an inbuotsai a, Mi ṭhangpui dingin insukhar la, en rawh."
"Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. [Selah","Aw LALPA, sipaihairawi Pathien, Israelhai Pathien, Nangma ngei chu hnam tinrêng sir dingin tho la, Mi vervêk suoltakhai chu lunginsiet hrim hrim naw."
"They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city.","Zântieng an hung nawk a, ui angin an khêk veng vung a, Khawpui chu an hêl an hêl a."
"Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, say they, doth hear?","Ngai ta, an bauah an inir suok a, An hmûra chun kâwlhnâmhai a um a: “Tu am hrie an um a?” an ti el a nih."
"But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, nangin anni chu nuisan lem i ta; Hnam tinrêng chu nuiêu i tih."
Because of his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower.,"Aw ka hrâtna, nghâk zing ka ti che. Pathien chu ka kulbîng insâng a ni sih a."
My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see my desire upon mine enemies.,"Ka chunga ngilnei Pathien chun mi tuok a ta, Pathienin ka hmêlmahai chunga ka duthusâm chu mîn hmutir a tih."
"Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.","Anni chu that naw la, chuong naw chun, ka mihaiin theinghil rawi an tih; Aw LALPA, kan phaw tak, I thilthawtheinain sukdar la, suktlâwm rawh."
"For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak.","An baua suolna lei le, an hmûra thu suok leiin, An chapona ngeia chun âwk raw se: An thu hril hlak, ṭawngseinphurna le khêlthu lei khawmin."
"Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth. [Selah","Annirawi chu lunginsenin sukbohmang la, an um ta nawna dingin sukbohmang rawh, Pathienin Jakobrawi chungah ro a rêl ti hre tâwl raw hai seh, Leihnuoi tâwp chenin."
"And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city.","Chun, zântieng hung nâwk hai sienla, ui angin khêk veng vung hai sien, Khawpui chu hêl hêl raw hai seh."
"They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.","Anni chu fâkding zawngin invâk an ta, An khawp naw chun zânkhawvârin um an tih."
"But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chun i hrâtna thu hi hlain sak ka ta, Anih, zîngkâr chun i ngilneina thu hi hlimtakin hlain sak ka tih: Nang chu ka kulbîng insâng, Ka lunginzîng nia kân humhimna i ni si hlak a."
"Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.","Aw ka hrâtna, nangma inpâkna hla sak ka tih. Pathien chu ka kulbîng insâng, ka chunga ngilnei Pathien chu a ni sih a."
"O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.","Aw LALPA, lunginsenin mi kâwk naw la, Lunginsenin mi thunun bawk naw rawh."
"Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.","Aw LALPA, mi lunginsiet la, ka chau zo ta sih a; Aw LALPA, mi sukdam rawh, ka ruhai hi a na zo vawng ta sih a."
"My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?","Ka hringna khawm a lungin- zîng bêk bêk bawk a nih: Aw LALPA, nangin iengchen am i mi thlathlam ding a na?"
"Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake.","Aw LALPA hung kîr nâwk la, ka hringna sanhim la, I ngilneina leiin mi sandam la."
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?,"Thi hnung chun nangma hriet zingna a um si nawh a, Seola chun tuin am lâwmthu hril a ti che leh?"
I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.,"Kân rûmnain ka châu tah, Zân tin ka zâlna chu tuiah ka suklâng a; Ka khum chu ka mitthliin ka sukhu hlak."
Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.,"Ka mit hi lungngaina leiin a hung se deu deu a, A mi dotuhai leiin a hung tar deu deu tah."
"Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.","Nangni thil suol thawtuhai po po, mi mâksan vawng ro. LALPA chun ka ṭap ri chu a hriet ta sih a."
Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.,"LALPA chun ka hnina chu a hriet ta sih a, LALPA chun ka ṭawngṭâina chu pawm a tih."
"All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.","A mi dotuhai po po chu muolphoin lunginzîng bêk bêk an ta, Kîr nâwk an ta, kâr lovin la muolpho thut an tih."
"O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.","Aw Pathien, nangin i mi thlauthlâk a, i mi suksiet a, I lo lunginsen tah am; aw, mi tungding nâwk rawh."
Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.,"Hi ram hi i sukthin a, i sukkak tah a, A kakhai chu siemṭha nâwk la, ân hnîng ân hnîng sih a."
Thou hast showed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.,"I mihai hi thil inkhawtakhai în tuoktir a, Pêmna uoin chu i mîn dâwn tir tah a."
"Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. [Selah","Nangma ṭituhai che kuoma chun puonzâr i pêk tah a, Thutak leia zar a ni theina dingin."
"That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.","I dittakhai hi sanhima an um theina dingin, I kut changtiengin sandam la, mi hung dawn rawh."
"God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.","Pathienin ân thiengnaa chun hieng ang hin a hril a, “Hlimtakin Sekem chu khawi dar ka ta, Sukkoth ruom chu sem dar bawk ka tih."
"Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.","Gilead chu ka ta a na, Manasse khawm ka ta a nih; Ephraim khawm chu ka lu humhimna a na, Juda chu ka lalhmawl a nih."
"Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me.","Moab chu kân sâwpna bêl a na; Edoma chun ka kekawk pei ka tih; Philistia khawm chu hnein khêk khum ka tih,” tiin."
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom?,Khawpui dettaka chun tuin am mi ṭhuoi lût a ta? Edom rama chun tuin am mi ṭhuoi a ta?
"Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.","Aw Pathien, nangma ngeiin i mi thlauthlâk a ni naw am a nih? Aw Pathien, kan sipaihai kuoma hlak i suok ve ta si nawh a."
Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.,A mi dotuhai thaw dingin mi ṭhangpui la; Mihriem ṭhangpuina chu teplo mei mei a ni sih a.
Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.,"Pathien zârah huoitakin thawng ei ta, Ama chu a mi dotuhai sirdetu ding a ni sih a."
"Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer.","Aw Pathien, ka khêk ri hi lo hre la, Ka ṭawngṭâina hi lo ngai rawh."
"From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.",Ka lungril a chau lai hin kâwlkila inthawk hin ko ka ti che; Lungpui keia nêka insânga chun mi ṭhuoi la.
"For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy.","Nang chu keia ta dinga humhimna, A mi dotuhaia inthawka râlvêngbûk insâng dettak i ni sih a."
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. [Selah,"I puon ina chun kumkhuoin um ka ta, I thla hnuoi inbîkna hmuna chun tlulût ka tih."
"For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.","Aw Pathien, nang chun ka thutiemhai i ngai sih a, I hming ṭituhai ram hluo chu i mi pêk a."
Thou wilt prolong the king’s life; His years shall be as many generations.,"Lal dam sûng hi suksei i ta, A kumhai chu suon tamtak tluk nîng a tih."
"He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.","Pathien hmaah kumkhuoin um zing a tih, Aw, ama humhim theina dingin ngilneina le thutak buotsai rawh."
"So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.","Chuongchun, ka thutiemhai ni tina ka thaw sawng theina dingin, Kumkhuoin i hming inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him cometh my salvation.,"Ka hringna hin Pathien chau a nghâk a, Amaa inthawk chun ka sandamna a hung suok ding a nih."
He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.,"Ama chau chu ka lungpui le a mi sandamtu a nih; Ka kulbîng insâng a na, nasatak chun inhnîng naw ningah."
"How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?","Nangni po poin, sukhlum ding le, Lung bang inâwn thaw ang le, pal tlu vâng vâng thaw angin, Ieng chen am mi pakhat hi in thaw ding a na?"
"They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. [Selah","A ropuinaa inthawka nam thla ding ngawtin an inrâwn a, Khêl hril hi an lâwm zâwngtak a na, An bauin mal an sâwm a; nisienlakhawm, an lungrilin ṭawngsie an inphur si hlak."
"My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him.","Ka hringna, Pathien chau nghâk rawh; Ka beiseina hi ama kuoma inthawka suok a ni sih a."
He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my high tower; I shall not be moved.,"Ama chau chu ka lungpui le ka sandamna a nih; Ka kulbîng insâng a na, inhnîng naw ningah."
"With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.","Pathien kuomah ka sandamna le ka ropuina a um a, Ka hrâtna lungpui le kân humhimna chu Pathienah a um a."
"Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. [Selah","Nangni mipuihai, ienglai khawmin ama chu ring unla, In lungril chu a hmaa chun bunthla ro: Pathien chu ei ta dinga inhumhimna a nih."
"Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.","Mi inhnuoihai hi iengkhawm an ni nawh a, mi insânghai khawm hi khêl an nih; Bûknaa chun an inkâng dai a, Iengkhawm ni lo nêk khawmin an zâng lem a nih."
"Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart thereon.","Nêksâwrna hi ring naw unla, Inrûkhmang hi sawngah nei bawk naw unla, Hausakna hung pung sien khawm, a chunga chun in lungril innghat bawk naw ro."
"God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God.","Pathien chun vawikhat a hril a, E! hi hi vawi hni ka hriet tah: Thilthawtheina hi Pathien ta a nih ti hi."
"Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.","Aw LALPA, zainêmna hi i ta bawk a nih, Mi tin an thilthaw ang sengin i thung hlak sih a."
"O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is.","Aw Pathien, nang chu ka Pathien i na, zîngkâr zawng ka ti che; Ram ṭâwl chautak, tui um nawna hmuna hin, Ka hringna hi nangma ngaiin a dangchâr a, ka tisa hin a ngai che a nih."
"So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory.","Chuong ang bawkin hmun inthienga chun ka en zing che kha, I thilthawtheina le i ropuina hmu dingin."
"Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee.","I zainêmna hi hringna nêka a ṭhatlem leiin, Ka hmûr hin inpâk a ti che."
So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.,"Chuong ang chun ka dam sûng po po chun inpâk ka ti cheh a, I hmingin ka kuthai phar ka tih."
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;,"Ka hringna hi thlin le thâua khawp angin khawp a ta, Ka bau hin hlim hmûr putin inpâk bawk a ti che."
"When I remember thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches.","Ka khumlaizâwlah ka hriet zing cheh a, Zâna i chungchâng thu ka suongtuo lai chun."
"For thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.","Nang chu a mi ṭhangpuitu i ni sih a, I thla hnuoia chun hlimin hla ka sak ding a nih."
My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me.,"Ka hringna hin a zui tlat cheh a, I kut changtiengin i mi kei hlak."
"But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.","Ka hringna sukbo tuma zawngtuhai ruok chu, Hnuoi hmun hnuoi hnungahai chun lût an tih."
They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes.,"Kâwlhnâm thilthawtheina kuoma pêk nîng an ta, Sihalhai chan ni tâng an tih."
But the king shall rejoice in God: Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.,"Lal ruok chu Pathienah hlim a ta, Ama sâla inkhâm taphawt chun ama chu sawng an tih; Khêl hril hmanghai bau chu hipin a um ding a ni sih a."
"Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.","Aw Pathien, ka lungzîngna thua hin ka râwl hi lo ngai la, A mi dotuhai ṭitumnaa inthawk hin ka hringna hi humhim rawh."
"Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;","Thil ṭha naw thawtuhai inrâwn rûknaa inthawk chun mi thuphmang la, Thil suksuoltuhai inhâwrkhâwmhaia inthawk chun:"
"Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,","Chuonghai chun kâwlhnâm angin an lei an tâtngei a, An thal, thu khahai chun an tin hlak;"
"That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.","Mi demkailo chu hmun fienriela an kâp theina dingin; Ṭi lovin, kârlovin an kâp thut hlak."
"They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them?","Thil suol thaw ding chun an infui tuoh a, Châng, inrûka kam thua dâm an inbiek hlak a, “Tuin am chuong chu hmûng an ta?” an tih a."
"They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep.","Rîtlona an zawng suok hlak a, “Ṭhahnemngaitakin kan zawng zo tah,” an ti hlak a. An sûngtieng ngaituona le lungril chu inthûktak a ni seng nghâl a."
But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun anni kâp a ta, Kârloa thala inhliemin um an tih."
"So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: All that see them shall wag the head.","Chuongchun, anni lei ngei chun anni a do leiin, sukkatin um an ta, Anni hmu taphawthai chun an lu thinkhum an tih."
"And all men shall fear; And they shall declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing.","Chuongchun, mi po poin ṭîng an ta, Pathien sinthaw chu hril an tih; A thilthaw khawm chu vartakin ngaituong an tih."
"The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.","Mi felhai chu LALPAAH lâwm an ta, amaa chun ringna innghat an ta, Lungril indiktak put po pohai chun sawng an tih."
"Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion; And unto thee shall the vow be performed.","Aw Pathien, Ziona chun inpâknain a nghâk zing che, Thutiem chu i kuoma chun hlen nîng a tih."
"O thou that hearest prayer, Unto thee shall all flesh come.","Aw ṭawngṭâina ngaitu, I kuomah tisa po po chu hung an tih."
"Iniquities prevail against me: As for our transgressions, thou wilt forgive them.","Rîtlonahai chun a mi hne hlak deha chu, Kan bawsietnahai po chu nangin sâwpfai i tih."
"Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, That he may dwell in thy courts: We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, Thy holy temple.","Mi, i biekin inhuonna sûng tuollaia um thei dinga, I thlanga, i kuom tieng i înpantir chu a hamṭha: I in ṭhatna chun tlai kan ta, I biekin hmun inthieng ṭhatna chun."
"By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, Thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of them that are afar off upon the sea:","Aw a mi sandamtu Pathien, Thil râpthlâktakhaiin keini mi hung dawn i tih, Nang kâwlkawdawnga mi po po le, Tuisuoriet chung hlataka umhai iring chu i nih."
"Who by his strength setteth fast the mountains, Being girded about with might;","Thilthawtheinaa tâia inkhita, Mâni hrâtnaa tlânghai sukhnîng hlaktu chu i nih;"
"Who stilleth the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.","Tuisuoriet inri hum hum, a fâwn inri hum humhai le, Mi tin sa mur mur sukre hlaktu chu i nih."
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.,"Kâwlkawdawnga umhai khawm chun i inhriettirna chu an ṭi hlak a, Zîngtieng le zântieng suoknahai chu hlimin în khêktir hlak a;"
"Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it, Thou greatly enrichest it; The river of God is full of water: Thou providest them grain, when thou hast so prepared the earth.","Hnuoi hi i kan a, tuiin i châwm a, Nasatakin i sukṭha hlak: Pathien vadung chu tuiin a sip a, Hnuoi hi chuong anga i buotsai hnung chun an ta dingin bu i siempêk hlak."
Thou waterest its furrows abundantly; Thou settlest the ridges thereof: Thou makest it soft with showers; Thou blessest the springing thereof.,"A changkuonghai chu tui tamtakin i châwm a, A changkuong tlânghai chu i sukdên a, Ruotuiin i suknêm a, A thil mâwnghai chu mal i sâwm hlak."
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; And thy paths drop fatness.,"Kum chu i ṭhatna în khum- tir a, I lampuihai chu thil ṭhain a far hlak."
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; And the hills are girded with joy.,"Thlalêra ran tlatna hmunahai chun a far a, Tlânghai khawm chu hlimnaa khuop vêlin an um a."
"The pastures are clothed with flocks; The valleys also are covered over with grain; They shout for joy, they also sing.","Ran tlatna hmunhai chu ran ruolin a dâpin a dâp a, Ruomhai khawm chu buin ân zâwl hmur a; Hlimin an khêk a, hla an sak bawk a."
"Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:","Leihnuoi po pohai, Pathien chawimawiin hlimtakin khêk unla,"
Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.,A hming ropuizie chu hlain sak suok ro: Ama inpâkna chu sukropui ro.
"Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.","Pathien kuomah, “I thilthawhai chu a va ropui de! I thilthawtheina nasatzie leiin nangma dotuhai chu i kuomah intuklût an tih."
"All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. [Selah","Leihnuoi po pohai hin chibai bûk an ti che a, Nangma inpâkin hla sak an ta, I hming inpâkin hla sak an tih,” ti ro."
"Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.","Hung ta u, Pathien thilthawhai hi en ta u, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilthawa hin ṭi a um a nih."
He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him.,"Ama chun tuisuoriet kha hnuoi ṭâwlah ân changtir a, Vadungpui kha kein an fe kâi a; Chutaka chun amaah ei hlim a."
He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. [Selah,"A thilthawtheina chun kumkhuoin ro a rêl a, A mitin hnam tin a en hlak: Hel hmanghai chu anni le anni inchawimawi naw raw hai se."
"Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard;","Aw mi tinhai, ei Pathien chu inpâk unla, Ama inpâkna ri chu inhriettir ro:"
"Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved.","Ama chun ei hringna hi a sukhring zing a, Ei kehai hi suktâwl a phal nawh."
"For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.","Aw Pathien, nangin i mi fieh a, Tangkaruo fieha a um angin, keini i mi fieh a."
Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.,"Nangin lênah i mi ṭhuoi lût a, Kan kâwnga hin phur riktak chu în nghat a."
Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.,"Mihai tawlailîr chunga chuongin, kan lu chungah în fetir a, Mei le tui kan fe thleng a, Nisienlakhawm, hmun chênghnâwngtaka lût dingin i mi ṭhuoi suok a;"
"I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,","Pumrawhmanga thil inhlânhai leh i inah lût ka ta, Ka thutiemhai chu i kuomah hlen ka tih."
"Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress.","Ka hmûrin a hril a, Lunginzînga ka um laia ka bauin a hrilhai chu."
"I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. [Selah","Sa thâutak pumrawhmanga thil inhlânhai i kuomah inhlân ka ta, Berâmchalhai raw rim inhnik leh; Bâwngchalhai, kêlhai leh inhlân ka tih."
"Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.","Hung ta u, Pathien ṭituhai po po, ngai ta u, Chuongchun, ka hringna dinga a thilthaw chu inhriettir ka ti cheu."
"I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue.","Ama chu ka bauin ka ko a, Ka leia chawimawiin a um a."
"If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear:","Ka lungrila suolna ka ngaisak chun, LALPA chun mi ngaisak naw nih."
But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun a mi lo ngai a, Ka ṭawngṭâina ri chu a lo bengkhawn a nih."
"Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me.","Pathien, ka ṭawngṭâina inhlawsamtir loa, ka kuoma a ngilneina ma ngailotu chu, Inpâkin um raw se."
"God be merciful unto us, and bless us, And cause his face to shine upon us; [Selah","Pathienin mi lunginsiet sienla, mal mi sâwm sienla; A hmêl chu ei chungah hung invartir raw se."
"That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.",I lampui chu hnuoi chunga mi hriet a ni thei a; I sandamna chu hnam tinrêng laia hriet a ni theina dingin.
"Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.","Aw Pathien, mi tinin inpâk sienla che, Mi tinrênghai chun inpâk raw hai se che."
"Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, And govern the nations upon earth. [Selah","Aw, hnam tin chu lâwmtaka umin, hlimin hla sak raw se. Nangin mi tin chu thlierbîk nei loa ro rêlpêkin: Hnuoi chunga hnam tin chu i awp ding a ni sih a."
"Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.","Aw Pathien, mi tinin inpâk sienla che, Mi tinrênghai chun inpâk raw hai se che."
"The earth hath yielded its increase: God, even our own God, will bless us.","Hnuoi hin a thil ṭo chu a pêk a, Pathien, eini Pathien ngei chun mal mi sâwm a ta."
God will bless us; And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.,"Pathienin mal mi sâwm a ta, Kâwlkawdawnga mi po po khawmin ama ṭîng an tih."
"Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; Let them also that hate him flee before him.","Pathien chu tho sienla, ama dotuhai chu sukdarin um raw se, Ama theidatuhai khawm chu a hmaah tlânse raw se."
"As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: As wax melteth before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.","Meikhu hi lên hmanga a um ang hin, anni chu lên hmang la; Khuoihlu hi mei luma ân tuihmang angin, Mi rilohai chu Pathien hmaah bohmang raw se."

Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.,"An umna chu hung ṭâwp sienla, An puon inahai chun tukhawm um naw raw se."
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.,"I ivuok chu an suknawmnah a, I înhliemhai lungngaizie chu an hril si hlak a."
Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness.,"An rîtlona chu rîtlonain belsa la, Anni chu i felnaa chun lût naw raw se."

He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery shafts.,Thina hriemhreihai chu ama thatna dingin a siem diem ta bawk a; A thalhai chu chawk theiin a siem a.
"Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.","En ta, suolna hasein a um a, Anih, thil suksuolna a vawn a, khêlthu a nei tah a."
"He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made.","Khur a siem a, inthûktakin a cho a, Ama hum siema chun a tla tah a."
"His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.","A thil suksuolna chu ama lu chung ngeia chun hung kîr nâwk a ta, Nunsetaka a thilthaw chu ama lusîpa ngei hung tlâng a tih."

By thee have I been holden up from the womb; Thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: My praise shall be continually of thee.,"Ka nu phîngsûnga inthawk hrimin nangma keihruoiin ka um hlak a, Ka nu phînga inthawka mi la suoktu i nih; Nang i nih kân pâk rawp ding che chu."
I am as a wonder unto many; But thou art my strong refuge.,"Mi tamtak ngaiin thilmak ang ka na, Nisienlakhawm, nang chu kân humhimna dettak i nih."
"My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, And with thy honor all the day.","Ka bau hi nangma inpâknain sip a ta, Sûnnithlâkin nangma chawimawinain sip bawk a tih."
Cast me not off in the time of old age; Forsake me not when my strength faileth.,"Ka tar pha leh mi pei thla naw la, Ka tha a ṭhum pha leh mi mâksan bawk naw rawh."
"For mine enemies speak concerning me; And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,","A mi dotuhai chun ka chung- châng thu an hril sih a, Ka hringna inchântuhai chu an inrâwn bawk a,"
"Saying, God hath forsaken him: Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.","“Pathienin a mâksan tah: Hnawt unla, man ro; sanhimtu ding hrim an um si nawh,” tiin."
"O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me.","Aw Pathien, mîn hlat lul naw la, Aw ka Pathien, mi ṭhangpui dingin inhmaw rawh."
Let them be put to shame and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.,"Ka hringna dotuhai chu muolpho le bohmangin um sienla, Ka sietna ding zawngtuhai chu hrilsietna le inzakna inkhumin um raw se."
"But I will hope continually, And will praise thee yet more and more.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chun chu beisei rawp ka ta, Inpâk zuol deu deu ka ti che."

"They shall fear thee while the sun endureth, And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.","Nisa khi a um sûng phawt chu ṭîng an ti cheh a, Thla um sûng po khawmin, suon um sûng po po chun."
"He will come down like rain upon the mown grass, As showers that water the earth.","Ama chu hlobet râwtna chunga ruotui tla angin tlâng a ta, Hnuoi châwmtu ruotui ang elin."
"In his days shall the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.","A dam lai chun mi felhai chu inno hlut hlut an ta, Thla um naw hma khat chun, lungmuongna nasatak um a tih."
"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth.","Ama chun tuisuorieta inthawka tuisuoriet dang chenin ramawp nei a ta, Vadungpuia inthawka kâwlkawdawng chen khawmin."
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; And his enemies shall lick the dust.,"Thlalêra umhai chu a hmaah kûn an ta, Ama dotuhai chun pilvut liek an tih."
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute: The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.,"Tarsis ram le thlierkâra lalhaiin lâwmman hung chawi an ta, Seba le Sheba ram lalhaiin thilpêk hung inhlân bawk an tih."
"Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; All nations shall serve him.","Anih, lal po po chu a hmaah bawkkhup an ta, Hnam tinrêngin a rawng bâwl an tih."
"For he will deliver the needy when he crieth, And the poor, that hath no helper.","Pasiein a koin ama chun sanhim a ta, Mi rimsi ṭhangpuitu nei naw khawm chu sanhim a tih."
"He will have pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he will save.","Mi rimsi le pasiehai chu lunginsiet a ta, Pasiehai hringna chu sandam a tih."
He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence; And precious will their blood be in his sight:,"An hringna chu nêksâwrna le nunsietnaa inthawkin intlan a ta, An thisen chu ama ngai chun hlutak a ni ding a ni sih a."
And they shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: And men shall pray for him continually; They shall bless him all the day long.,"Chun, hring an ta, Sheba ram rângkachak chu a kuoma pêk nîng a tih, Mihaiin ama chu ṭawngṭâipêk rawp an ta, Sûnnithlâkin mal sâwmpêk an tih."
There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains; The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.,"Hnuoiah, tlâng chungahai hin bu tamtak um a ta, A vui chu Lebanon angin inhnîng suou suou a ta, Khuoa mihai chu hnuoi hlobet angin inno hlut hlut an tih."
His name shall endure for ever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun: And men shall be blessed in him; All nations shall call him happy.,"A hming chu kumkhawtluongin dei naw nih a. A hming chu ama a um sûng chu dei loin um pei a ta, Mihai chu amaa chun malsâwmin um an ta, Hnam tinrêngin ama chu hamṭha tîng an tih,"
"Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, Who only doeth wondrous things:","LALPA Pathien, Israelhai Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se, Ama chau hin thilmak a thaw hlak a."
"And blessed be his glorious name for ever; And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.","A hming ropuitak hi kumkhawtluongin inpâkin um bawk sienla, Hnuoi pumpui khawm hi a ropuinaa suksipin um raw se; Amen, Amen."
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.,Jessai naupa David ṭawngṭâi- nahai chu a tâwp tah.
"Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart.","Pathien chu Israelhai chungah a lo ṭha ngei a, Lungrila inthienghai chunga chun."
"But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chun chu ka sirpel vâng vâng a, Ka ke pênhai hi ân tlêu vâng vâng a nih."
"For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.","Mi rilohai vângneizie ka hmuin, Mi uonghai chu kân hnar sih a."
For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.,"An thi lai chun tuorna hrim an nei nawh a, An hrâtna chu a det lem hman hman a."
They are not in trouble as other men; Neither are they plagued like other men.,"Mi dang anga rinumin an um nawh a, Mi dang sawisakin an um bawk nawh."
Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.,"Chuleiin, chapona chun khai- diet angin an rîng a zem a, Nunsietna chun silfên angin a tuom a."
Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.,"Thâu leiin an mit a pâwng a, Lungrila duthusam nêka nasa an nei a."
"They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.","An innuisan a, suoltakin nêksâwrna thu an hril a; Chapotakin an ṭawng hlak."
"They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.","An bau chu vânahai khin an sieh a, An lei chun hnuoi hi a fang thleng hlak."
Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full cup are drained by them.,"Chuleiin, a mihai chu chutaka chun an kîr nâwk a, Tui noa sip chu anni idâwn fai rêtin a um a."
"And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?",“Pathienin iengtin am hrieng a ta? Achunghnungtak chun hrietna a nei ding am a nih?” an tih a.
"Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.","En ta, hienghai hi mi rilohai an ni hi, Inhawitirtaka umin an hausa deu deu hlak."
"Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;","A thlâwn elin a nih, ka lungril hi ka sukfai a, Ka kuthai demkailonaa ka sâwp chu."
"For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.","Sûnnithlâkin sawisakin ka um a, Tûk tin kâwkin ka um sih a."
"If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.","“Chuong ang chun hril ka tih,” lo ti ta inla, Ngai ta, i nauhai thlahai chunga vervêktaka lo thaw nîng ka tih."
"When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;","Chu chu ka hriet theina ding zie ka ngaituo chun, Ka ta dingin a na taluo a nih."
"Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.","Pathien hmun inthienga ka lût a, An tâwpna ding ka ngaituo hma chun."
Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.,"Anni chu hmun innâltakahai i sie ngei a, Sietnaahai i pei thlâk hlak."
How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.,Iengtizieha mitkhapkâr chaua an rêm el am a ni aw! Thil râpthlâktakhaia sukbo- hmang daiin an um ta a ni hi.
"As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.","Miin meng hnunga mang an ngainêp angin, Aw LALPA, i har pha chun anni hlimthla chu ngainêp i tih."
"For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:","Ka lungril hi a lungngai a, Ka lungrila khawm sûn angin ka um sih a."
"So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.","Mi mâwl le iengkhawm hre lo ka na, I kuoma chun sa ang el ka ni hiel hlak kha."
Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.,"Nisienlakhawm, i kuomah ka um rawp a, Ka kut changtieng hi i lo chel hlak."
"Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.","Nangin i remruotnain mi ṭhuoi i ta, Chu hnunga chun ropuinaa khin mi lâwm i tih."
Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.,Vâna khin nang naw chu tu am ka nei a? Hnuoia khawm hin nang naw chu ka dit tukhawm an um nawh.
My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.,"Ka taksa le ka lungril hi a chau tah a, Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chu kumkhuoa ka lungril hrâtna ding le ka chanvo a nih."
"For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee.","Ngai ta, nangma hlata umhai chu an bohmang ding a ni sih a, A uiret santu taphawt che chu i sukbohmang tah a."
"But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.","Keia ta ding chun Pathien hnai hi a ṭha a nih; LALPA Pathien chu kân hum- himna dingin ka hmang a, I sinthaw po po thu ka hril theina dingin."
"O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?",Aw Pathien Iengdinga kumkhuoa i mi thlauthlâk am a na? Iengdinga i ran tlatna hmuna berâmhai chunga hin i lungsen a khûk am a na?
"Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.","I mihai inkhâwmhai, inhmaha i închâwk, Hnam i ro dinga i întlan kha, hre zing rawh; I umna hlak Zion tlâng leh."
"Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.","Kumkhaw rêmna tieng chun i ke khai la, Dotuhaiin hmun inthienga chun thil suol tinrêng an thaw ta hi."
Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.,"Nangma dotuhai chu i mihai inkhâwmhai laia chun an hawhaw dur dur a, An inchiknahai chu inchikna dingin an khai tah a."
They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees.,"Mi, rampui thing, Hreipuia tinhai angin an inlang a."
And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers.,"Tuhin chu a thil kermawihai po po chu, Hreite le tubauhaiin an suksiet zo tah a."
They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.,"I hmun inthieng chu an rawh a, I hming umna khawm chu leihnuoi ichîm khawp hielin an sukkhawhlo tah a."
"They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.","An lungrila chun, “Sukse vawng tâwl ei tiu,” an tih a, Hi rama Pathien inkhâwmna in po po hi an raw siet zo tah."
We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.,"Kan inchiknahai chu kan hmu ta nawh a, Zâwlnei hrim hrim an um ta nawh a, A sâwt dingzie hre hrim hrim khawm keini lai an um nawh."
"How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?","Aw Pathien, dotu chun ieng chen am a hrilsiet ding che? Hmêlma chun kumkhuoin i hming hi a hrilsiet ding am a nih?"
"Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.","Iengdinga i kut, i kut changtieng kha i lâk kîr am a na? Kei dawk nâwk la, anni chu sukbohmang rawh."
"Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chu inhma chena ka Lal a nih, Hnuoi laitaka sandamna siemhlaktu chu."
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.,"Nang chun i hrâtnain tuisuoriet kha i sukṭheh a, Nang chun tuia drakonhai luhai chu i sukkawi a."
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.,"Nang chun Leviathan luhai chu i suknâwi a, Ama chu thlalêra umhai kuoma chun bu dingin i pêk a,"
Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.,"Nang chun tuihnâr le tuilien chu în ṭhe huk a, Nang chun vadung lientak takhai chu i sukkang a."
"The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.","Sûn hi i ta a na, zân khawm i ta a nih; Nangin êntu le nisa khi i buotsai a."
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.,"Nangin leihnuoi ramrihai po po chu i khang vawng a, Nangin nipui le thlasik hi i siem a."
"Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.","Aw LALPA, hi hi hre zing rawh, dotu chun a hrilsiet cheh a. Hnam invêttak chun i hming an hrilsiet kha."
Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.,"Aw, i vaṭhu hringna hi ram sahrâng kuoma chun pe lul naw la, I mi rimsihai hringna hi kumkhuo chun theinghil lul naw rawh."
Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.,"Thuthlung kha hung pawisa la, Hnuoi hmun inthim lai chu nunsietnain a sip sih a."
Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.,"Aw, nêksâwrna tuortuhai chu muolphoin kîr naw sienla, Rimsi le pasiehai chun i hming inpâk raw se."
"Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.","Aw Pathien, tho la, nangma thu chu nangin inhril fâwm la, Mi invêt chun sûnnithlâkin a hrilsietzie che chu hre zing rawh."
Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.,"Nangma dotuhai ri chu theinghil naw la, Nangma dotuhai ri so insâng zuol pei chu."
"We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.","Aw Pathien, lâwmthu kan hril che, Lâwmthu kan hril che, i hming a hnai sih a; Mihaiin i thilmakthaw thuhai chu an hril hlak."
"When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.","Hun ruot chu ka hmu pha chun, Indiktakin ro rêl ka tih."
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. [Selah,Hnuoi le a chunga um po pohai chu an intuihmang zo tah: Keiin a banhai chu ka phun a nih.
"I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:","Mi uonghai kuoma chun, “Iengleangin um naw ro,” ka tih a, Mi rilohai kuomah, “In ki suk- sâng naw ro,” ka ti bawk a."
Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.,"In ki chu chungtieng suksâng naw unla, Rîng tlûn pumin ṭawng naw ro."
"For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up.","Suksângna chu saktienga inthawk a ni nawh, thlangtienga inthawk a ni bawk nawh. Simtienga inthawk hlak a ni bawk nawh."
"But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.","Pathien chu rorêltu a ni lem: Ama chun pakhat a suktlâwm a, pakhat a suksâng hlak."
"For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.","LALPA kuta chun no a um sih a, a uoin chu a phul a, Thil dang le chawkpawlin a sip a, chutaka inthawk chu a bunsuok a. Matheiloin a nenghai chen chun hnuoia mi rilohai chun dâwn fai rêt an tih."
"But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chun chu kumkhuoin inhriettir ka ta, Jakob Pathien chu inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.,"Mi rilohai ki po po khawm chu tanpêk ka ta, Mi felhai ki ruok chu suksângin um a tih."
In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.,"Judahai lai chun Pathien chu hrietin a um a, Israelhai lai chun a hming a ropui a nih."
"In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.","Salema chun a bâwktê chu a um a, Chun, ama umna chu Zionah a um a,"
"There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. [Selah","Chutaka chun thalngul thalhai chu a suksiet a, Phaw dâm, kâwlhnâm dâm, indona dâm leh."
"Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey.","Nang chu ropuitak le ṭhatak i na, sase tlânga inthawk chun"
"The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.","Pasalṭhahai chu rawkin an um a, An in chu an in sawng tah a; Mi hrât khawm tukhawmin an kut an inlet thei ta nawh."
"At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.","Aw Jakob Pathien, i kâwkna leiin, Tawlailîr le sakawr khawm ininnghiltir dêrin an um ve veh a;"
"Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?","Nang, nangma ngei chu ṭi ding i nih, I lunginsen taphawt chun tu am i mithmuah ngîr thei an ta?"
"Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,","I rorêl thu chu vâna inthawkin în hriettir a, Hnuoi hin a ṭih a, a to tah a."
"When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. [Selah","Hnuoia mi thuhnuoirawlhai po po sandam dinga, Pathien chu rorêl dinga a tho lai khan."
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.,"Matheiloin mihriem lunginsenna hin la hung inpâk ngei a ti che, Lunginsenna mahla chun inkhit i tih."
"Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.","Thu tiem unla, LALPA in Pathien kuoma chun hlen ro, A vêla mi po po chun ṭidingpa chu lâwmmanhai hung chawipêk raw hai se."
He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.,"Ama chun rorêltuhai huoina chu sât bawng a ta, Ama chu hnuoia lalhai ta ding chun ṭi a um a nih."
"I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.","Ka râwlin Pathien chu ko ka ta, Ka râwlin Pathien ngei chu ko ka ta, ama chun keia tieng na lo sit a tih."
"In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted.","Ka lunginzing ni chun LALPA ka zawng a; Ka kut hi zâna khawm la thla loin ka phar zing a, Ka hringna hin thlamuon a nuom nawh."
"I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. [Selah","Pathien ka hriet zing a, ka buoi hlak; Ka ngaituoh a, ka thlarau hi a châu hlak."
Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.,"Ka mithai hi i chel meng zing hlak a, Ṭawng theilo khawp rauvin ka lunginzing hlak."
"I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.","Tienlai nihai ka ngaituoh a, Tienlai kumhai chu."
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.,"Zâna ka hla sak chu ka hriet thar nâwk a, Ka lungrilah kân ngaituo hlak; Ka thlarau khawmin ṭhahnem- ngaitakin a zawng a."
Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?,LALPA chun kumkhuoin a thlauthlâk ding am a ni aw? Iengtika khawm a lâwm naw ding am a ni aw?
Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?,A ngilneina chu a bo sawng kumkhuo ding am a ni aw? A thutiem chu suon po po chenin a bo ding am a ni aw?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? [Selah,Pathien chun lunginsiet a theinghil am a ni aw? Lungsenin a lainatnahai chu a khâr ta am a ni aw?
"And I said, This is my infirmity; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.","Chun, “Chu chu ka hrât nawna lei a nih; Nisienlakhawm, Achunghnung- tak kut changtieng kumhai kha hre zing ka tih."
I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.,"LALPA thilthaw thuhai kha hril ka ta, Tienlaia i thilmak thawhai kha hre zing ka tih."
"I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings.","I sinthaw po po kha ngaituo bawk ka ta, I thilthawhai khawm kha sût ka tih,” ka tih a."
"Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God?","Aw Pathien, i lampui chu hmun inthiengah a um a, Pathien ang hi pathien ropui tu am an um a?"
Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.,"Nang chu thilmak thaw hlaktu Pathien chu i na, Mi tin laiahai chun i hrâtzie în hriettir hlak."
"Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. [Selah","I bânin i mihai i sansuok a, Jakob le Josef nauhai chu."
"The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.","Aw Pathien, tuihai chun an hmu cheh a, Tuihai chun an hmu cheh a, an ṭih a, Tui inthûktakhai chu an inthin bawk a."
The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.,"Sûmhai khin tui an bun- thlâk a, Vânhai khin râwl an insuo a, I thalhai khawm ân lep zak zak a,"
The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.,"I vâninrûm ri chu thlivirah a um a, Kâwlinlephai chun khawvêl hi a el zawt zawt a; Hnuoi hi inthinin ân hnîng dur dur a."
"Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.","I lampui chu tuisuorietah a um a, I lampuihai chu tui lientakah a um a; I kehnunghai khawm hriet a ni nawh."
"Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.","Mosie le Aron kutin, I mihai chu berâm ruol angin i ṭhuoi hlak."
"Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.","Aw ka mihai, ka dân thua hin na lo sit unla, Ka baua thuhaiah in na hung daw ro."
"I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,","Tekhithuin ka bau kâng ka ta, Tiena thu ril hril tahai kha hril suok ka tih."
"Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.","Chuong chu ei nain ei hriet a, ei lungrilin ei hriet bawk a, Ei thlatuhai khawmin an mi hril bawk kha."
"We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.","Chuong chu an nauhai kuomah ip nâwm ei nih a, Ruolthar hung dinghai kuoma LALPA inpâkna thu le, A hrâtzie le a thilmaktak thawzie chu hril lem ei tih."
"For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;","Jakobhai laiah thuinhriettir a sukdet a; Israelhai lai dân a ruot a, Chuong chu ei thlatuhai kuomah thupêkin a pêk a; Anni chun chuong thu chu an nauhai kuomah an inhriettir dingin."
"That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,","Ruolthar la hung um ding, naupang la hung pieng dinghai chun an hriet theina dingin; Chuonghai chu an tho a, an nauhai kuoma an la hrilsâwng peina dingin;"
"That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,","An beiseina chu Pathienah an innghat theia, Pathien thilthawhai chu an theinghil nawha, A thupêkhai chu an zâwm lemna dingin;"
"And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.","Le, an thlatuhai anga, Suon kâwmaw le hel hmang, Suon lungril siem diklo, Pathien kuoma lungril ringum naw puta an um nawna dingin."
"The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.","Ephraim thlahai chu râlthuoma inthuoma, thalngul chawiin, Inthaw ni chun an tlânseh a."
"They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;","Pathien thuthlung chu an zâwm nawh a, A dâna um an nuom naw bawk a;"
"And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.","A thilthawhai chu an thei- nghil a, A thilmak thaw ân hmutirhai khawm chu."
"Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.","An thlatuhai mithmuah thilmakhai a thaw hlak a, Aigupta rama Zoan phûla chun."
"He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.","Tuisuoriet chu a sukṭhe phawk a, anni chu ân fe kâitir a, Tuihai chu iengkhat sie khâwm thûr angin ân ngîrtir nguou a."
"In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.","Sûna chun sûmin a ṭhuoi a, Zânkhawvârin meichawkin a ṭhuoi bawk hlak a."
"He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.","Thlalêra chun lungpuihai a sukkhawi bawk a, Tui inthûktaka inthawk ang el, ditkhawpa dâwn ding a pêk a."
"He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.","Lungpuia inthawk chu vadunghai a suksuok a, Tuihai chu vadungpuihai ang elin ân luong thlâktir a."
"Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.","Chuong sa khawma a chungah thil an la suksuol ta rawp a, Ram ṭâwla chun Achunghnungtak chunga chun an hel a."
And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.,"An châkna sukre dinga fâk ding hniin, An lungrilin Pathien an fieh a."
"Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?","Anih, Pathien an hrilhnâwm a, “Thlalêra hin Pathienin daw- kân a buotsai thei am chu?"
"Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?","Ngai ta, lungpui chu a vuokin tuihai kha a hung inkhâw suokin, Vadunghai chu a kuong a liem pûr pûr ta luoh a, Bu khawm a pêk thei nghâl am chu? A mihai ta ding hin sa a buot- sai ding am chu?” an tih a."
"Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;","Chuongchun, LALPA chun a lo hriet a, a lung a sen tah a, Jakobhai chungah mei a hung chawk suok tah a, Israelhai chungah lunginsenna a hung tah a."
"Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.","Pathien an ring nawh a, A sandamna khawm an ring naw leiin."
"Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;","Nisienlakhawm, chungtienga vân dumhai khi thu a pêk a. Vân kawtkhârhai khi a hawngpêk a."
"And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.","An fâk dingin manna kha an chungah a zuk insûrtir a, Vân bu chu an kuomah a pêk a nih."
Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.,"Mihriemhaiin mi hrâthai bu chu an fâk a, Khawpna khawpin bu a hung pêk a."
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.,"Khaw sak thli chu vânah ân hrângtir a, A thilthawtheinain sim thli chu a ṭhuoi a."
"He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:","Sa chu pilvut zât rauin an chungah ân sûrtir a, Vatê thla nei chu tuisuorieta phaiphin zât rauin."
"And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.","An riekhmun laia chun ân tlâktir a, An umna bûk kâwl vêlahai chun."
"So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.","Chuongchun, an fâk a, an khawp hleh a, An ichâk chu an kuomah a pêk tah a nih."
"They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,","An châk a la re nawh a, An bu chu an bauah a la um a."
"When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.","Chuong lai tak chun Pathien lunginsenna chu an chungah a tlah a, An mi thâuhai ṭhenkhat a that a; Israel tlangvâlhai chu a vuok thlûk tâwl a."
"For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.","Chuong sa khawmin thil an la suksuol ta rawp a, A thilmak thawhai chu an ring chuong nawh."
"Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.","Chuleiin, an dam sûng nihai chu teplo mei meiin a sukbo pêk a, An dam sûng kumhai chu ṭitnain a sukbo pêk bawk a."
"When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.","Anni a that poleh ama chu an zawng hlak a, An kîr nâwk a, zîngkâr Pathien an zawng hlak."
"And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.","Pathien chu an lungpui a nih ti le, Pathien Achunghnungtak chu an intlantu a nih ti an hriet suok hlak."
"But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu an bauin an inpâk tehlêm a, An leiin a kuomah khêlthu an hril hlak."
"For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.","An lungril chu ama kuomah ân dik si nawh a, A thuthlunga chun ring an um bawk nawh."
"But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu lai- natnaa a sip leiin an rîtlona chu a ngaidam a, anni chu a sukbohmang nawh; Anih, vawi tamtak a lunginsenna chu a lâk kîr a, A lunginsenna chu a rêngin a chawktho nuom ngai nawh."
"And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.","Tisa chau an nih ti a hriet zing a, Thli, lêt nâwk lo dinga hrâng liem hlak ang hi."
"How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!","Thlalêra khan a chungah an va hel inzingin, Ram ṭâwla khan ama chu an va suklungngai inzing de!"
"And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.","An ngha kîr nâwkin Pathien an fieh a, Israelhai mi inthieng chu an suknuor hlak."
"They remembered not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;","A kut chu an hriet zing nawh a, Anni dotuhaia inthawka a sanhim ni chu an hriet zing ngai nawh."
"How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,","Khânga Aigupta ramah inchiknahai a sieh a, Zoan phûlah thilmakhai a sie bawk a;"
"And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.","An vadungpuihai chu thisenah ân changtir a, An vadunghai chu thisenah ân changtir bawk kha; chuong- chun, an dâwn thei ta nawh a."
"He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.","Anni lai tho tamtak a tir a; chuongchun, anni chu a fâk zo a, Uhai a tir bawk a, chuongchun, anni chu a sukbohmang tah a."
"He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.","An thil kakhai khawm chu tuktulung kuomah a pêk a, An sininrim ra chu khâuṭhikṭhi kuomah a pêk bawk a."
"He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.","An grêp hruihai chu rielin a sukhlum a, An theichang kûnghai khawm chu vûrin a sukhlum bawk a."
"He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.","An ranhai khawm chu riel kuomah a pêk a, An ranruolhai khawm chu ṭêk lumtak kuomah a pêk bawk."
"He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.","A lunginsenna nasatak chu an chungah a thlâk a, Lunginsenna dâm, lungdam nawna dâm, lunginzîngna nasatak dâm hi, Thil ṭha nawtak intluntu tirko pâwl chu."
"He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,","A lunginsenna ding chun lampui a siempêk a, An hringna chu thinaa in- thawkin a humhim nawh a, An hringna chu hri kuomah a pêk ta lem a."
"And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.","Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po a sukhlum a, Ham puon inhaia an hrâtna ra hmasa takhai chu:"
"But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.","Nisienlakhawm, ama mihai chu berâm angin a ṭhuoi- suok a, Ranruol angin thlalêra khan a ṭhuoi a."
"And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.","Himtakin a ṭhuoi a, chuongchun, iengkhawm an ṭi nawh a, Nisienlakhawm, tuisuoriet chun an hmêlmahai chu ân khum zo tah a,"
"And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.","Chun, a hmun inthieng ramri chu a ṭhuoi tlung a, Hi tlâng a kut changtienga a închâwka hin."
"He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.","Hnam tin chu an hmaah a hnawt suok a, Anni chu hruia inkhi dingin rochanah a siem a. An puon ina chun Israel hnamhai chu ân umtir tah a."
"Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Achunghnungtak chu an infieh a, a chungah an hel a, A thu inhhriettirhai chu an zâwm si nawh a."
"But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.","Ngha kîrin, an thlatuhai angin vervêktakin an thaw ta lem a: Thalngul ringum naw angin an fe kâwi tah a;"
"For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.","An hmun insânghaiin ama chu an suklungsen hlak sih a, An milim siemhaiin an inthîktir bawk a."
"When God heard this, he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;","Pathienin chu chu a lo hrietin a lunginsen a, Israelhai chu a tirdak ta êm êm a."
"So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;","Chuongchun, Silo biekbûk, Mihriem laia a puon in sie chu, a mâksan a."
"And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary’s hand.","A hrâtna chu salah ân man- tir a, A ropuina chu dotuhai kutah ân mantir ta bawk a."
"He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.",A mihai chu kâwlhnâm kuomah a pêk a; A rochan chunga chun a lunginsen tah a.
Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.,"Meiin an tlangvâlhai chu a kânghmang a, An nunghâkhai chun inneina hla hrim hrim an nei ta nawh a."
Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.,"An thiempuhai chu kâwlhnâma sukthlûkin an um a, An hmeithaihai chu ṭap hrim hrim an ṭap nawh."
"Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.","Chuong lai chun LALPA chu,mi an in an har angin, a har tah a, Mi hrât uoin leia khêk ang hin."
And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.,"Ama dotuhai chu a vuok kîr a, Kumkhaw hmingsietna ân hlawtir tah a."
"Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,","Chu naw khawm chu Josef puon in chu a dit nawh a, Ephraim hnam chu a thlang naw bawk a."
"But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.","Juda hnam chu a thlang ta lem a, A hmangai Zion tlâng chu."
"And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.","A in inthieng chu vân insânghai ang khin a bâwl a, Kumkhuoa dinga a suknghet leihnuoi ang hin."
"He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:","A siehlaw David chu a thlang a, Berâm huona inthawk dâm chun a lâk suok a,"
"From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.","Berâmpui te ṭhuoihaia inthawkin a ṭhuoi suok a, A mihai Jakobhai le Israelhai châwm dingin."
"So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.","Chuongchun, ama chun a lungril ṭhatna ang peiin anni chu a châwm a, A kut thiemnain a ṭhuoi tah a."
"O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.","Aw Pathien, hnam tin i rochana hin an lût a,"
"The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.","I siehlawhai ruok chu chunga vatêhai buah an pêk a, I mi inthienghai sa chu ram sahai kuomah an pêk a."
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.,"An thisen chu Jerusalem vêla hin tui angin an bunthlâk a, Anni phûmtu ding hlak tukhawm an um si nawh,"
"We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.","Kan vêla mihai hrilsietin kan lo um a, Kan dep vêla mihai hmusit le nuisanin kan lo um a,"
"How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?","Aw LALPA, ieng chen am i lunginsen kumkhuo ding a na? I thîkna chu mei angin a chawk ding am a nih?"
"Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.","Nangma hre naw hnam tin chunga hin i lunginsenna chu bunthla la, I hming lam naw ramhai chunga khawm chun."
"For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.","Jakobhai chu an fâk zo a, An umna chu an suk ram ta sih a."
Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.,"Kan thlatuhai rîtlona kha keini kuoma hin chu hre zing ta naw la, I lainatnahai chun mi hung tuok vak sienla; Nasataka sukhnuoiin kan um ta sih a."
"Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name’s sake.","Aw Pathien a mi sandamtu, i hming ropuina dingin mi ṭhangpui la, I hming leiin mi sanhim la, kan suolhai hi hung sâwp fai rawh."
"Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight.","Hnam tinin, “Khâwlai am an Pathien kha teh?” an ti el dîm a nih? I siehlawhai thisen suok phubalâkna chu, Kan mithmuah hnam tin lai hin hriet ni raw se."
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;,"Mi intâng inrûm ri chu i hmaah tlung sienla, I thilthawtheina nasatzie ang peiin thi dinga ruothai chu humhim rawh."
"And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.","Aw LALPA, nangma an hrilsietna che kha, Kan vêla mihai kuomah an ângsûngah a lêt sariin thung nâwk rawh;"
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations.,"Chuongchun, keini i mihai, i ran tlatna hmuna berâmhai hin, Kumkhawtluongin lâwmthu hril kan ti cheh a, Suon po po chenin nangma inpâkna chu inhriettir pei kan tih."
"O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!","Aw LALPA, kan LALPA, Hnuoi chung po poa hin i hming chu a va ṭha de! I ropuina chu vân chungahai khin i sieh a."
"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.","I hmêlma le phubalatu sukdeina dingin, Nangma dotuhai lei chun, Nautehai le nêne ne laihai bau suok chun hrâtna i sukdet a."
"When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;","I vân, i kutsuokhai, Thla le arasi i ruothai khi ka ngaituo châng chun,"
"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?","Mihriem hi ieng am a na, i hriet zing hlak a na? Mihriem naupa khawm hi ieng am a nih a i kan hlak a na? ka ti hlak."
"For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.","Ama chu Pathien nêka inhnuoi deu chauin i siem a, Ropuina le chawimawina în khumtir sih a."
Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:,I kutsuokhai chunga hin thu în neitir a; A ke hnuoiahai iengkim i sieh a:
"All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,","Berâm le bâwnghai po po leh, Anih, ramsahai khawm chu;"
"The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.","Chunglêng vate le tuisuoriet ngahai, Tuisuoriet lampuia fehai po leh;"
"O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!","Aw LALPA, kan LALPA, Hnuoi chung po poa hin i hming a va ṭha de!"
"Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth.","Aw Israelhai vêngtu, Berâm pâwl anga Josefhai ṭhuoitu, na lo sit rawh aw; Nang cherubhai chunga ṭhung chu, hung var suok rawh."
"Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, And come to save us.","Ephraimhai le, Benjaminhai le, Manassehai mithmua chun i hrâtna kha chawktho la, Keini mi sandam dingin hung rawh."
"Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.","Aw Pathien, mîn nghatkîrtir nâwk la; I hmêl kha sukvar la; chuong- chun, sandamin um kan tih."
"O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?","Aw LALPA, sipaihai Pathien, Ieng chen am i mihai ṭawngṭâina chunga hin i lunginsen ding a na?"
"Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.","Anni chu mitthli beiin i châwm a, Mitthli hi dâwn dingin inkhina lientakin i pêk hlak."
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.,"Nangin kan vêla mihai ta dinga insêlnaah i mi siem hlak a, A mi dotuhai chu an innui tâwl hlak."
"Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.","Aw sipaihai Pathien, mîn nghatkîrtir nâwk la, I hmêl kha sukvar la, chuongchun, sandamin kan um ding annâwm."
"Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.","Aigupta rama inthawka grêphrui i hung lâk a, Hnam tin chu i hnawt dawk a, i phun tah a;"
"Thou preparedst room before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.","A hma i sukfai pei a, Inthûktakin zung a kei a, ram chu a aw ta vawng a."
"The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God.","Tlânghai chu a hlim tuomin an um tâwl a, A kâuhai chu Pathien sidar thinghai ang el a nih,"
"It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.","A kâuhai chu tuisuoriet chenin ân zâm suoktir a, A dâwn inderhai chu Vadungpui chenin."
"Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?",Iengdinga a palhai chu i suksiet am a na? Lama fe taphawtin an kei thlâk ta hi.
"The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.","Ramhnuoia sanghal chun a suksiet a, Ram sahai khawmin an tlân hlak."
"Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,","Aw sipaihai Pathien, lungin- siettakin nghakîr nâwk ta; Vâna inthawk khan zuk en la, hi grêp hrui hi en la, hung kan rawh."
"And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.","A kûng i kut changtiengin a phun le, A kâu i ta dinga i sukhrât le hin."
"It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.","Meiah a kâng tah a, phûrin a um tah a; I hmêla halna leiin an bohmang hlak."
"Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.","I kut kha i ditsak mi chungah um raw se, Mihriem naupa i ta dinga i sukhrât chunga hin."
"So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.","Chuongchun, kîr san naw ning ung cheh a, Mi sukhar la; chuongchun, i hming lam kan tih."
"Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.","Aw LALPA, sipaihai Pathien, mîn nghatkîrtir nâwk la. I hmêl kha sukvar la, chuongchun, sandamin um kan tih."
Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.,"Pathien a mi sukhrâttu chawimawiin hlimtakin hla sak unla, Jakob Pathien chawimawiin hlimtakin khêk ro."
"Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery.","Inpâkna hla sak unla, khuongtê dâm, Ṭingṭang ngainuomumtak dâm, perkhuong dâm leh hung chawi ro,"
"Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day.","Thla thara chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, Thla lir laia ei ruoiṭhe hun lai leh."
"For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.","Israelhai ta dinga thuruot a ni sih a, Jakob Pathien dân a nih."
"He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, Where I heard a language that I knew not.","Chu chu Josef-a chun thu inhriettirna dingin a ruot a, Aigupta rama a fe thleng lai khan; Ka ṭawng hriet naw râwl ka hriet a"
I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket.,"An liengko chu thil rika inthawkin ka lâk hmang a, An kuthai chu leikhâwra inthawka inthlain a um kha."
"Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. [Selah","Lunginzîngin in mi ko a, ka sanhim cheu a, Vâninrûm inbîkhmangna hmuna khan ka dawn cheu a; Meriba tuia khan kân fie cheu kha."
"Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!","Aw ka mihai, ngai unla, inhriettir ka ti cheu, Aw Israelhai, ka thu ngai ta ve unla chu aw!"
There shall no strange god be in thee; Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.,"Ram dang pathien hrim hrim in lai an um ding a ni nawh a, Mi dang pathien hrim hrim chu in biek ding a ni bawk nawh."
"I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.","Kei LALPA in Pathien chu ka nih; Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu kha. In bau ka lien unla, ka suksip ding annâwm."
But my people hearkened not to my voice; And Israel would none of me.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka mihai chun ka râwl an ngai si nawh a; Israelhai chun an mi dit naw kha."
"So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.","Chuongchun, an lungril kâwmaw ang peia um dingin ka thlathlam a, Anni remruot anga an umna dingin."
"Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways!","Aw, ka mihai hin ka thu ngaiin, Israelhai hi ka lampuia hin fe hai sien chu aw!"
"I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries.","An hmêlmahai chu ka suktlâwm vakin, Anni dotuhai chunga chun ka kut kân let ding bah."
The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever.,"LALPA theidatuhai chu a hmaah ṭiin kûn an tih, An hrem tuorna chun kumkhuo dai a tih."
He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.,"Nangni chu bu ṭhatakin châwm ka ti cheu a, Lungpuia khuoizuin ka sukkhawp ding cheu a nih."
God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods.,Pathien chu Pathien inkhâwmna siema chun a ngîr a; Pathienhai lai chun ro a rêl a.
"How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? [Selah","Ieng chen am indik nawtaka ro in rêl a, Mi rilohai chu in ditsak bîk ding a na?"
Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.,"Rimsihai le pa nei nawhai ro chu rêl unla, Rinum tuorhai le pasiehai chunga chun sukdik ro."
Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.,"Rimsihai le pasiehai chu san unla, Mi rilo kuta inthawk chun sanhim ro."
"They know not, neither do they understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are shaken.","An hriet nawh a, hrietthiemna an nei bawk nawh; In thima chun an inlawn an inlawn a; Leihnuoi innghatna po po chu ân hnîng ta vawng a."
"I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High.","“Pathienhai in na, In rêngin Achunghnungtak nauhai in nih,” ka ti kha."
"Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.","Nisienlakhawm, mihriemhai ang elin la thîng in ta, Mi lien pakhat ang khan la tlûng in tih."
"Arise, O God, judge the earth; For thou shalt inherit all the nations.","Aw Pathien, tho la, hnuoi chung ro hi rêl rawh, Hnam tinrêng hi i la lâkkhâwm ding a ni sih a."
"O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.","Aw Pathien, ṭawng loin um naw la, Aw Pathien, to zing naw la, um ṭawk ṭawk lul naw rawh."
"For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.","Ngai ta, nangma dotuhai chu an sa mur mur a; Nangma theidatuhai chu an lu an suksâng a,"
"They take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.","I mihai vervêktakin an phierrûk a, I mi thuphmanghai chunga hin a se tiengin an inrâwn a."
"They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.","“Thaw ro, an hnam bo khawpin sukbohmang ei tiu, Israelhai hming hrim hrim hi hriet zinga a um ta nawna dingin,” an ta,"
For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:,"Inthuruolin an inrâwn a, I chungah a se tienga thaw dingin thu an intiem tâwl a."
"The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;","Edomhai le Ismaelhai puon in dâm, Moabhai le Hagarhai dâm,"
"Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:","Gebalhai le Ammonhai le Amalekhai dâm, Philistinhai, Tura khuoa umhai leh."
Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. [Selah,"Assuriahai khawm anni tieng an ṭhang veh a, Lota thlahai chu an ṭhang- pui a,"
"Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;","Annirawi chu Midianhai chunga i thaw ang dâm, Kison vadunga Sisera chunga i thaw ang dâm, Jabin chunga i thaw ang khan thaw ve rawh."
"Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.","Chuong mihai chu Endor khuoah an bohmang a, Hnuoi dingin êkdûr ang el an lo ni ta kha."
"Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;","An mi lienhai chu Oreb le Zeeb i thaw ang khan thaw la, Anih, an lalhai po po chu Zeba le Zalmunna ang khan tukdei rawh."
"Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.","Chuong mihai chun, “Pathien umnahai chu, Hluopêk ei tiu,” an ti kha."
"O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.","Aw ka Pathien, anni chu pilvut khu chum chum ang hin the dar la, Businâwi thli imût lêng ur ur ang el hin."
"As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,","Ram kângtu mei ang le, Tlâng kângtu meichawk ang elin;"
"So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm.","Anni chu i thlipuiin hnawt la, I thli natak chun sukṭi rawh."
"Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.","Aw LALPA, i hming an zawng theina dingin, An hmêl chu inzaknain suksip rawh."
"Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;","Kumkhuoin, muolpho le lunginzîngtakin um hai sienla, Anih, sukzaka umin bohmang raw se."
"That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.","Nangma chau hi JEHOVAH hming put, Hnuoi chung po poa Achung- hnungtak i nih ti an hriet theina dingin."
"How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!","Aw sipaihai LALPA, I umnahai chu dit a va um de!"
"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah; My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God.","Ka hringna hin LALPA biekin inhuonna sûng tuollai chu a ngai êm êm a, anih, a chau pha hiel a. Ka lungril le ka taksa hi Pathien hring kuoma chun hlimin a khêk suok a."
"Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, My King, and my God.","Anih, chawngzawngin in a hmuh a, Pelêuvin a ta dingin bu a hmu bawk a, a te siena dingin; Aw sipaihai LALPA, ka Lal le ka Pathien, Chu chu i mâichâmhai ngei chu a nih."
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will be still praising thee. [Selah,"I ina umhai chu an hamṭha a, Nang chu inpâk rawp an ti che."
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways to Zion.,"Nangmaa hrâtna nei mi chu a hamṭha, A lungrila Zion panna lamlienhai umna chu."
"Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.","Ṭapna ruom chu an hraw laiin tuihnâr umnahaiah an siem hlak a, Anih, ruotui tla hmasa chun malsâwmnain ân khum hlak."
They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.,"Hrâtnaa inthawkin, hrât nâwk zuolnaah an fe hlak a, Ziona Pathien hmaa chun an inlang seng hlak."
"O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob. [Selah","Aw LALPA, sipaihai Pathien, ka ṭawngṭaina hi mi lo ngaipêk la, Aw Jakob Pathien, na lo sit rawh."
"Behold, O God our shield, And look upon the face of thine anointed.","Aw Pathien, kan phaw tak, en ta, I hrieknâl pa hmêl hi en ta."
"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.","I biekin inhuon sûng tuol- laia ni khat um hi ni sâng khat nêkin a ṭhalem sih a; Rîtloa puon inhaia um nêk chun, Ei Pathien ina kawtkhâr vêng- tu ni khawm ka nuom lem a nih."
For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.,"LALPA Pathien chu nisa le phaw a ni sih a, LALPA chun lunginsietna le ropuina pêng a ta, Indiktaka umhai kuoma chun thil ṭha hrim hrim inro naw ni."
"O Jehovah of hosts, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.","Aw sipaihai LALPA, Nangma ring mi chu a hamṭha ie."
"Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.","LALPA i ram chunga hin i lâwm a, Jakobrawi sala an um chu i ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a."
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin. [Selah,"I mihai rîtlona i ngaidam a, An suolna po po chu în khum zo tah."
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.,"I lunginsenna po po chu i lâk hmang a, I lunginsenna nasatak chu i nghatsan tah a."
"Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.","Aw, a mi sandamtu Pathien, mîn nghatkîrtir la, Kan chungah i lunginsenna chu sukbo rawh."
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?,Kan chungah i lunginsen kumkhuo ding am a nih? I lunginsen chu suon po po chenin în langtir pei ding am a nih?
"Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?","Nangmaa chun i mihai an hlim theina dingin, I mi sukhar nâwk naw ding am a nih?"
"Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation.","Aw LALPA, i zainêmna chu mîn hmutir la, I sandamna chu mi pe bawk la,"
"I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly.","Pathien LALPA thu hril ding chu ngai ka ta, A mihai le a mi inthienghai kuomah lungmuongna thu a hril ding a ni sih a; Nisienlakhawm, anni chu invêtna tieng ngha nâwk ta naw raw hai se."
"Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.",A sandamna chu ama ṭituhai hnaia chun a um ngei ngei hlak a nih; Ei rama hin ropuina a um theina dingin.
Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.,"Ngilneina le thutak ân tuok a, Felna le remna an infâwp a."
Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.,"Thutak chu hnuoia inthawkin ân der suok a, Felna chun vâna inthawkin a hung en thla tah a."
"Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase.","Anih, LALPA chun thil ṭha pêng a ta, Ei ram hin a thilkak chu pe bawk a tih."
"Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.","Felna chun hma ṭhuoi a ta, A kehnunghai chu felna dinga lampuiah siem a tih."
"Bow down thine ear, O Jehovah, and answer me; For I am poor and needy.","Aw LALPA keia tieng hin i na hung sit la, mi hung dawn rawh, Rimsi le pasetak ka ni hi."
"Preserve my soul; for I am godly: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.","Ka hringna hi vawngṭha la, Pathien ngaisak mi ka ni sih a, Aw, nang ka Pathien, nangma ringtu i siehlaw hi, sandam rawh."
"Be merciful unto me, O Lord; For unto thee do I cry all the day long.","Aw LALPA, mi lunginsiet la, Sûnnithlâkin ka ko hlak si cheh a,"
"Rejoice the soul of thy servant; For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.","I siehlaw hringna hi sukhlim la, Aw LALPA, ka lungril hi i kuomah ka sie tlat hlak sih a."
"For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon thee.","LALPA, nang chu i ṭhah a, ngaidam i pei a, A kotuhai che phawt kuomah zainêmna i hau sih a."
"Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; And hearken unto the voice of my supplications.","Aw LALPA, ka ṭawngṭainaa hin na lo sit la, Lunginsiet ka hnina râwl hi lo ngai rawh."
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; For thou wilt answer me.,"Ka lunginzîng ni chun ko ka ti cheh a, Nangin i mi dawn ding a ni sih a."
"There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; Neither are there any works like unto thy works.","Aw LALPA, pathienhai lai chun nang ang hrim hrim an um nawh a, I thilthawhai ang hi thilthaw hrim hrim a um bawk nawh."
"All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify thy name.","Aw LALPA, i siem hnam tinrênghai chu hung an ta, i hmaah hung kûn an ta, I hming chu hung chawimawi an tih."
"For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: Thou art God alone.","Nang chu i ropui a, thilmakhai i thaw bawk hlak sih a, Nangma chau hi Pathien i nih."
"Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name.","Aw LALPA, i lampui chu mîn chûktir la, i thutaka chun um ka tih, I hming ṭi dingin lungril sakhat mîn puttir rawh."
"I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; And I will glorify thy name for evermore.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka lungril po poin inpâk ka ti cheh a, I hming hi kumkhuoin chawimawi ka tih."
For great is thy lovingkindness toward me; And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.,Ka chunga i ngilneina chu a nasain; Ka hringna hi khursûng hnuoihnungtaka inthawkin i sanhim sih a.
"O God, the proud are risen up against me, And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, And have not set thee before them.","Aw Pathien, mi chapohai chun an mi thawh a, Mi nunse um khâwmhai chun ka hringna hi sukbo tumin an zawng a, Nang chu an hmaah an sie ngai naw che."
"But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, nang chu Pathien, lainatnaa sip, mi lunginsietthei, Lunginuoi, zainêm le thutak hau i nih."
"Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; Give thy strength unto thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.","Aw keia tieng hung ngha la, mi lunginsiet rawh. I siehlaw kuoma hin i hrâtna pe la, I suoknu nau hi sandam rawh."
"Show me a token for good, That they who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, Because thou, Jehovah, hast helped me, and comforted me.","Ṭhatna ding inchikna mîn entir la, A mi theidatuhai chun chu chu an hmuh a an muolphona dingin; LALPA nangin i mi ṭhangpuia i mi thlamuon leiin."
His foundation is in the holy mountains.,A lungphûm chu tlâng inthiengahai chun a um a.
Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.,"LALPA chun Zion kul kawtkhârhai chu, Jakobhai umna po po nêkin a ngaina lem a nih."
"Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. [Selah","Aw Pathien khawpui, I chungchâng thu ropuitakin an hril hlak a nih."
"I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there.","A mi hretuhai lai an ṭhang ve ti, Rahab le Babulon chungchâng thu hril ka tih; Philistin le Tura hi, Ethiopia le hin, en ta u; Hi mi hi chutaka pieng chu a nih."
"Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her.","A nih, “Saw saw le, hi hi mi hi amaa pieng an na, Achunghnungtak ngei chun ama chu sukdet a tih,” ti Zion chungchâng thu chu hril an tih."
"Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there. [Selah","LALPAIN mi tin hming a ziek pha chun, “Hi mi hi chutaka pieng chu a nih,” tiin, tiem a tih."
"They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.","Hlasaktuhaiin, lâmhai le chun, “Ka tuihnâr po po chu nangmaah a nih a um chu,” tîng an tih."
"O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.","Aw LALPA, a mi sandamtu Pathien, A sûn a zânin i hmaah ka khêk hlak a:"
Let my prayer enter into thy presence; Incline thine ear unto my cry.,"Ka ṭawngṭaina hi i hmaah lût sienla, Ka khêkriah i na hung sit rawh."
"For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.","Ka hringna hi lunginzîngna- haiin a sip a, Ka hringna hin Seol chu a hung hnai ta sih a."
"I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help,","Khursûnga zu fehai laia tiemsa ka na, Hrâtna hrim hrim neilo mi ang ka nih."
"Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And they are cut off from thy hand.","Râl thathai thlâna zâlhai anga, Mithi laia pei thlâk ka nih, Chuonghai chu i hriet ta nawh, I kuta inthawka sukbohmang an nih."
"Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps.","Khursûng hnuoihnungtakah i mîn zâltir tah a. Hmun inthimtak, inthûktakahai chun."
"Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. [Selah","I lunginsenna chun a mi del tlat a, Nangin i tuifâwn po po chun i mi sukrinum tah a."
"Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.","Ka hmêlhriethai chu keia hlatah în umtir a, An ta dinga tirdakumtakah i mi siem tah a; Khârkhumin ka um a, ka suok thei naw a nih."
"Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; I have spread forth my hands unto thee.","Rinumna leiin ka mit a se tieu tieu a, Aw LALPA, ni tin ka ko cheh a, Nanga tieng ka kuthai ka phar a."
Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? [Selah,Mithihai ta ding chun thilmak i thaw ding am a nih? Thi tahnunghai chun thoin an inpâk ding che am a nih?
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?,"I zainêmzie chu thlâna inhriettirin, I ringumzie chu Bohmangna hmuna inhriettirin a um ding am a nih?"
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?,I thilmak thawhai chu inthimah inhriettirin a um ding am a nih? I felna chu theinghilna ramah hrietin a um bawk ding am a nih?
"But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried; And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.","Aw LALPA, kei ruok chun ka ko cheh a, Ka ṭawngṭaina chun zîngkâr tuok a ti che."
"Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest thou thy face from me?","LALPA, iengdinga ka hringna hi i thlauthlâk am a na? Iengdinga keia tienga i hmai i thup am a na?"
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.,"Ka naupangtea inthawk rinum tuor le, thi vâng vângin ka um hlak a, I thil râpthlâktakhai ka tuorin ka thaah a mi man hlak."
Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.,"I lunginsen nasatak chun a mi chîm tlum a, I thil râpthlâktakhai chun a mi sukbohmang tah a."
They came round about me like water all the day long; They compassed me about together.,"Chuongchun, sûnnithlâkin tui angin an mi vêl a, An mîn huol vêl tâwl a,"
"Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.","A mi hmangaitu le ka ruol chu a mi hlatah în umtir tah a, Ka hmêlhriethai chu inthimah în umtir ta bawk a."
I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.,"LALPA ngilneina thuhai chu kumkhuoin hlaah sak ka ta, Ka bauin, i ringumzie chu suon po po chenin inhriettir ka tih."
"For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.","“Ngilneina chu kumkhuoa dingin remin um a ta, I ringumna chu vânahai ngei khin sukdet i tih,” ka ti tah a nih."
"I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant:","Nang chun i hril ta sih a; Ka mi thlang kuoma chun thu ka thlung a, Ka siehlaw David kuoma chun ṭawng kân khâm tah a,"
"Thy seed will I establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations. [Selah","“I thlahai chu kumkhuoha dingin sukdet ka ta, I lalṭhungpha khawm suon po po chenin inngîr zing ka tih,” tiin."
"And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.","Aw LALPA, vânhai khin i thilmak thawhai hi inpâk an ta, Mi inthienghai inkhâwmnaa khin i ringumna hi inpâk bawk an tih."
"For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,","Vân dumhaia khin LALPA le hrilkhi thei ding tu am an um leh? Mi thilthawtheitak nauhai lai khin LALPA ang,"
"A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him?","Mi inthienghai inrâwn khâwmnaa Pathien ṭiumtak, A kâwlvêla mi po po nêka ṭitak ding chu tu am a um leh?"
"O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.","Aw LALPA sipaihai Pathien, Aw JAH, nang anga mi hrât tu am an um a? I ringumna chu i vêlah a um sih a,"
"Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.","Nang chun tuisuoriet chapona chungah ro i rêl hlak a, A tuifâwn invawr laihai chu i sukre hlak."
"Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.","Nang chun Rahab chu râl that angin i sukkawi dar vawng a, Nangma dotuhai chu i bân thahrâtin i sukdar ta vawng a."
"The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.","Vânhai khi nanga ta a na, hnuoi khawm hi nanga ta a nih. Khawvêl le a sûnga thil um po po hi nangma inngîr a nih."
"The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.","Sim le hmâr chu nanga siem a na, Tabor le Hermon chun i hming leiin hlimin hla an sak hlak."
"Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.","Nang chun bân thilthawtheitak i nei a, I kut chu a hrât a, i kut changtieng chu chawimawiin a um a."
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.,"Felna le rorêlna fel chu i lalṭhungpha innghatna a na, Ngilneina le thutak chu i hmaah an fe hlak,"
"Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.","Ri hlimum hre hlak hnam chu an hamṭha ie, Aw LALPA, anni chu i hmêl varah an um hlak,"
In thy name do they rejoice all the day; And in thy righteousness are they exalted.,"I hming leiin sûnnithlâkin an hlim hlak a, I felna leiin chawimawiin an um hlak."
For thou art the glory of their strength; And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.,"Nang chu an hrâtna ropuina i ni sih a, I ditsakna leiin kan ki hi chawimawiin um a tih."
For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah; And our king to the Holy One of Israel.,"Kan phaw hi LALPA ta a ni sih a, Kan lal hi Israelhai Mi Inthieng ta a nih."
"Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.","Chuong lai chun i mi inthienghai kuomah inlârnaah thu i hril a, “Mi pakhat hrâttak chunga chun ṭhangpuina kân nghat a, Mi pakhat, mihai laia inthawka thlang suok chu ka chawimawi tah a."
I have found David my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him:,"Ka siehlaw David chu ka hmusuok a, Ka hriek inthieng chun ama chu ka nâl tah a."
With whom my hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him.,"Ka kut hi a kuomah sukdetin um a ta, Ka bân hin ama chu sukhrât a tih."
"The enemy shall not exact from him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.","Dotu chun ama chu hnesie ngai naw nih a, Rîtlona nau khawmin ama sukrinum naw nih."
"And I will beat down his adversaries before him, And smite them that hate him.","Ama dotuhai chu a hmaah vaw thlûng ka ta, Ama theidatuhai chu sawisâng ka tih."
But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him; And in my name shall his horn be exalted.,"Ama kuoma ruok chun ka ngilneina le ka ringumna chu um a ta, Ka hming leiin a ki chu chawimawiin um bawk a tih."
"I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.","A kut chu tuisuorieta chun innghattir ka ta, A kut changtieng chu vadungpuia hai chun."
"He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.","Ama chun, ‘Nang chu ka pa, Ka Pathien, ka insandamna lungpui i nih,’ tiin mi ko a tih."
"I also will make him my first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth.","Chun, keiin ama chu nau lutîrah siem ka ta, Hnuoia lalhai lai chun a chunghnungtakah siem ka tih."
My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; And my covenant shall stand fast with him.,"Ka zainêmna chu kumkhuoin a ta dingin kawl ṭhapêk ka ta, Ka thuthlung chu a kuomah um det a tih."
"His seed also will I make to endure for ever, And his throne as the days of heaven.","A chi thlahai chu kumkhuoin inumtir ka ta, A lalṭhungpha khawm chu vân um sûng ni chenin inumtir bawk ka tih."
"If his children forsake my law, And walk not in mine ordinances;","A nauhai chun ka dân hi an nghatsan a, Ka rorêlnahai anga an um nawh a,"
"If they break my statutes, And keep not my commandments;","Ka thuruot an bawsiet a, Ka thupêk an kawl ṭha naw chun;"
"Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.","An bawsietnahai chu hmawl leh hung kan ka ta, An rîtlonahai chu vuokin hung kan ka tih."
"But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ngilneina chu a kuoma inthawk chun lâkpêk vawng naw ning a, Ka ringumna chu khêla ân chang phal bawk naw ning."
"My covenant will I not break, Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.","Ka thuthlung chu bawse naw ning a, Ka hmûra thu suok chu sukdanglam bawk naw ning."
Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:,"Vawi khat ka inthiengna sâlin kân khâm a, David kuomah khêl hril naw ningah."
"His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me.","A chithlahai chu kumkhuoin um an ta, A lalṭhungpha chu ka hmaah nisa angin um bawk a tih."
"It shall be established for ever as the moon, And as the faithful witness in the sky. [Selah","Thla angin kumkhuoa dingin sukdetin um a ta, Vân duma hretu ringum ang khin,” i tih a."
"But thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.","Nisienlakhawm, nang chun i thlauthlâkin i dit nawh a, I hrieknâl chunga chun i lung a sen tah a."
Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.,"I siehlaw thuthlung chu i tirdak a, A lallukhum chu hnuoia peithla hielin i suktlâwm tah a."
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.,"A dâi po po chu i sukthlûk a, A kulbînghai chu i suksiet tah a."
All that pass by the way rob him: He is become a reproach to his neighbors.,"Lampuia fe poin a thil an lâkpêk hlak a, A vêla mihai hrilsietin a hung um tah a."
Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.,"Ama dotuhai kut changtieng chu i chawimawi a, A hmêlmahai po po chu i sukhlim tah a."
"Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle.","Anih, a kâwlhnâm hmawrzum chu i namkâwi a, Ama chu inthawnaa chun în ngîrdettir ta nawh a."
"Thou hast made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.","A ropuina chu i suktâwp a, A lalṭhungpha chu hnuoiah i pei thlâk tah a."
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: Thou hast covered him with shame. [Selah,"A tlangvâl lai nihai chu i suktâwipêk a, Ama chu muolphonain în khum ta sih a."
"How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? How long shall thy wrath burn like fire?","Aw LALPA, ieng chen am în bihmang kumkhuo ding a na? Ieng chen am i lunginsen chu mei anga a chawk ding a na?"
Oh remember how short my time is: For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!,"Aw, ka hun hi a tâwi dingzie hre zing la, Mihriem nauhai po po hi i va siem teplo ngei de!"
"What man is he that shall live and not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? [Selah","Ieng mi am thi ni hmêl hmu loa hringa, Seol kuta inthawka hringna sanhim ding chu?"
"Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?","LALPA, tienlaia i lunginsiet- na, i ringumnaa David kuoma inkhâma i tiem kha, Khâwlai am a um tah a?"
"Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,","LALPA, i siehlawhai an hrilsietna chu hre zing la, Hnam hrâttakhai po po hrilsietna ka ângsûnga ka tuor hlakzie hi."
"Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.","Aw LALPA, nangma dotuhai hrilsietna, I hrieknâl kehnunghai an hrilsietna chu."
"Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen, and Amen.","LALPA chu kumkhuoin inpâkin um raw se. Amen, Amen."
I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.,"LALPA, kuoma chun ka lungril po poin lâwmthu hril ka ta, I thilmak thaw po po chu inhriettir ka tih."
"I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.","Nangmaa chun lâwmin hlim ka ta; Aw nang Achunghnungtak, i hming inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
"When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence.","A mi dotuhai chu an tlânse phingleh, I hmaa chun an insui a, an bohmang tah a nih."
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.,Ka ta dinga âwm hrima le ka thua hin nangin i mi ṭan sih a; Feltaka ro rêlin lalṭhungphaa chun i ṭhung a.
"Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.","Hnam tin chu i hal a, mi rilohai chu i sukbohmang a, An hming chu kumkhawtluong- a dingin i thai hmang tah a."
"The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.","Dotuhai chu an beidawng zo a, kumkhuoha dingin mâkin an um tah. I khuo sukrêmtahai chu; Anni hriet zingna pumin a bohmang ta bawk a."
But Jehovah sitteth as king for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;,"LALPA ruok chu kumkhuoa dingin lalah a ṭhung a, A lalṭhungpha chu rorêlna dingin a buotsai tah."
"And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.","Ama chun khawvêl hi feltakin ro rêlpêk a ta, Thlierbîk nei loin mi tin ro chu rêlpêk a tih."
"Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;","Chuongchun, LALPA chu nêk- sâwra umhai ta ding chun kulbîng insâng nîng a ta. Lunginzîng huna chun kulbîng insâng lo nîng a tih."
"And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.","Chuongchun, i hming hretuhai chun ring an ti cheh a, Nang chun chu, LALPA, nangma zawngtuhai che chu i mâksan ngai si nawh a,"
"Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.","LALPA, Ziona um chu inpâkin hla sak unla, Mihai lai chun a thilthawhai chu hril ro."
For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.,"Thisen insuo suosal hlaktu chun anni chu a hriet zing hlak sih a, Mi rimsihai khêkri a theinghil ngai nawh."
"Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;","Aw LALPA, mi lunginsiet la, A mi theidatuhai leia ka lunginzîngna hi en ta, Nang thina kawtkhâra inthawka mi sansuok hlaktu;"
That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.,"Nangma inpâkna po po chu kân hriettir theina dingin; Zion naunu kawtkhârahai chun, I mi sandamnaa hin hlim ka tih."
The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.,"Hnam tin chu an khur siemahai chun an tlum a, An lên pha inrûka chun anni ke ngei a âwk tah a."
"Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. [Higgaion. Selah","LALPA chun ân hriettir a, rorêlna chu a tirsuok tah a, Mi rilo chu ama kutsuok ngeia chun a âwk hlak."
"The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.","Mi rilohai chu Seola chun kîr nâwk an ta, Hnam tin Pathien theinghil hmang hlakhai chu."
"For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.","Pasiehai chu theinghilin um zing zing naw ni hai a, Rimsihai beiseina chu kumkhuo chun bo sawng bawk naw ni."
"Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight.","Aw LALPA, tho la, mihriem el chun ngam naw raw se, Hnam tin chu i mithmuah ro rêlpêkin um raw se."
"Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. [Selah","Aw LALPA, anni chu sukṭi la, Hnam tin chun mihriem el an nih ti inhre raw se."
"Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations.","LALPA nang chu suon po po chena kan umna i ni hlak,"
"Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.","Tlânghai insieng hmaha, Leihnuoi le khawvêl în ngîr hma khawm khan, Chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin nang chu Pathien i nih."
"Thou turnest man to destruction, And sayest, Return, ye children of men.","Nang chun mihriem hi bohmangnaa în fetir hlak a, “Mihriem nauhai, kîr nâwk ro,” i ti hlak."
"For a thousand years in thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.","Nanga ngai chun kum sâng khat hi, Zâni bo ta ang chau kha a na, Zân vêng khat sûng ang chau bawk a nih."
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.,"Anni chu tui lien angin i lên hmang hlak a, ṭhang khat in ang chau an nih. Zîngkâr chun hlobet inder suok ang an nih."
"In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.","Zîngkâr chun a hung innoin a hung inder suok a, Zântieng chun ât thlûkin a um a, a vuoi hlak."
"For we are consumed in thine anger, And in thy wrath are we troubled.","I lunginsennaa sukbohmangin kan um a, I lungawi nawnaa suklungzîngin kan um bawk sih a."
"Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.","Kan rîtlonahai chu i hmaah i sieh a, Kan suol iprûkhai chu i hmêl varah i sie tah a."
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh.,"Kan dam sûng ni po po hi i lunginsennaah a bo hlak, Kan dam sûng kumhai hi tienami angin kan suktâwp hlak."
"The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away.","Kan dam sûng kumhai chu kum sâwmsari a na, Hrâtna leiin kum sâwmriet khawm a ni thei. Nisienlakhawm, a sâwtna chu sininrimna le lungngaina chau a nih; A bo vak a, keini khawm kan vuong hmang hlak a ni hi."
"Who knoweth the power of thine anger, And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?","Tuin am i lunginsenna thilthawtheizie hreha, Nangma ṭi dingzie anga i lunginsenna hrie le?"
"So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom.","Kan dam sûng nihai tiem dân ding mîn chûktir la, Varna lungril kan nei pha hielna dingin."
"Return, O Jehovah; how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.","Aw LALPA hung kîr nâwk la, ieng chen am i lunginsen ding a na? I siehlawhai chungthua chun i lungril inlêt rawh."
"Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.","Aw, zîngkâr chun i ngilneinain mi suktlai la, Kan dam sûng po po hin kan hlima kan lâwm theina dingin."
"Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, And the years wherein we have seen evil.","Nangin i mi sukrimsik ni le, Thil ṭha naw kan tuok kum sûng hu ang khan mi suklâwm rawh."
"Let thy work appear unto thy servants, And thy glory upon their children.","I sinthaw chu i siehlawhai kuomah inlang sienla, I ropuina chu an nauhai kuomah inlang raw se."
"And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.","Chun, LALPA kan Pathien mawina chu kan chungah um raw se: Kan kut sinthaw hi kan chungah sukdet bawk la, Anih, kan kut sinthaw hi sukdet rawh."
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.,"Achunghnungtak inbîkna hmuna um chu, Iengkimthawthei hlima chun um zing a tih."
"I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.","LALPA chungthua chun, “Ama chu ka inhumhimna le ka kulpui, Ka Pathien, ka iring chu a nih,” tîng ka tih."
"For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence.","Ama chun châng kamtu chânga inthawk le, Hri ṭha nawtaka inthawk chun a sanhim ding che a nih."
"He will cover thee with his pinions, And under his wings shalt thou take refuge: His truth is a shield and a buckler.","A thla chun inkhum a ti cheh a, A thla hnuoia chun himtakin um i ta, A thutak chu phaw chîn le phaw lien a nih."
"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;","Zâna thil râpthlâk chu ṭî naw ti nih a, Sûna thal hung inlêng hlak chu ṭî bawk naw ti nih."
"For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.","Inthim hnuoia hri inlêng hlak chu ṭî naw ti nih a, Sûn laia thil sukse hlak sietna chu ṭî bawk naw ti nih."
"A thousand shall fall at thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But it shall not come nigh thee.","I sîrah sâng tlûng an ta, I changtieng chun sîng tlu bawk an tih; Nisienlakhawm, nang chu hnai naw ni che."
"Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And see the reward of the wicked.","I mitin en i ta, Mi rilohai thungna chu a hmu hin hmu chau i tih."
"For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation;","Aw LALPA, nang chu ka înhumhimna i ni sih a! Achunghnungtak chu i umnain i hmang a."
"There shall no evil befall thee, Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.","Thil ṭha naw hrim hrimin tuok naw ni cheh a,. Hri hrim hrim khawmin i puon in hung hnai bawk naw nih."
"For he will give his angels charge over thee, To keep thee in all thy ways.","I kawng tinrênga humhim ding chein, I chungthua chu a vântirkohai chu thu a pêk ding a ni sih a."
"They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.","An kutin dawm an ti cheh a, Chuong naw chun, i kein lung sui rawi i tih."
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot.,"Sakeibaknei le rûl chu sir dêng i ta, Sakeibaknei vânglai le rûlriel chu sir hriel neng i tih."
"Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.","Ka chungah a hmangaina ân nghat tlat leiin sanhim ka ta, Ka hming a hriet leiin hmun insângah dawm kai ka tih."
"He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him.","A mi ko pha chun, dawn ka ta, A lunginzîng lai chun a kuomah um ka ta, Ama chu sanhimin chawimawi ka tih."
"With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation.","Dam sâwtnain suklungawi ka ta, Ka sandamna chu inhmutir bawk ka tih."
"It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;","LALPA kuoma lâwmthu hril le, Aw Achunghnungtak, i hming inpâkna hla sak hi thil ṭhatak a nih;"
"To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,","Zîngkâra i zainêmna suklang le, Zân tina i ringumna suklang hi,"
"With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.","Thil sutthei hrui sâwm nei mi le, perkhuonghai, Ṭingṭang ri mi lungriem inthlâktir thei dâma suklang hi."
"For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.","LALPA, nang chun i sinthawin i mi suklâwm sih a. I kut thilthawhai leiin hlimin hla sak ka tih."
"How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.","Aw LALPA, i thilthawhai chu a va ropui de! I ngaituonahai chu ân thûk êm êm a nih."
A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this:,Mi mâwl chun hi hi a hriet nawh a; Mi invêtin a hrietthiem bawk nawh:
"When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.","Mi rilohai hlobet anga an hung inder a, Thil suksuoltuhai po po an hung inno hlut hlut hin, Kumkhuoa dinga sukbo- hmangin an um ding a hung ni hlak, ti hi."
"But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore.","Aw LALPA, nang ruok chu kumkhuoa dinga insângtaka um zing i nih."
"For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.","Aw LALPA, ngai ta, nangma dotuhai hi, Ngai ta, nangma dotuhai hi an bohmang ding a nih; Thil suksuoltuhai po po hi sukdarin an um vawng ding a nih."
But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka ki hi ramsiel ki angin i chawimawi a, Hriek thara nâl ka ni tah."
"Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.","Ka mitin ka hmêlmahai chunga ka duthusâm tlung chu a hmu tah, Ka na hin thil ṭha naw thawtu, a mi hung thawtuhai chunga ka duthusâm tlung ri chu a hriet tah."
The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.,"Mi fel chu intûm angin inno hlut hlut a ta, Lebanon tlânga sidar thing angin inṭhang duok duok a tih."
They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.,"LALPA ina phunhai chu, Ei Pathien biekin inhuonna tuol sûnga chun inno hlut hlut an tih."
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green:,"Tar hnung khawma la ra rawp an ta, Tuihnâng pâi ṭeuin hring hlut hlut an tih."
"To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.","LALPA chu mi indiktak a nih ti inlangtirna dingin, Ama chu ka lungpui a nih, amaa chun fel nawna hrim hrim a um nawh."
"Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.","LALPA chu lalah a ṭhung a, a ropuinain ân thuom a, LALPA chu ân thuom a, hrât- nain a kâwngah ân khit tah a: Khawvêl khawm hi ân hnîng thei nawna dingin sukdetin a um a."
Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting.,"I lalṭhungpha chu tiena inthawka lo sukdet tah a na, Nang chu chatuona um tah i nih."
"The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.","Aw LALPA, vadungpuihai chun an insuoh a, Vadungpuihai chun an râwl an insuoh a. Vadungpuihai chun an ri nasatak chu an insuoh a."

"Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.","I thuinhriettirhai chu ring a um êm êm a, Aw LALPA, kumkhawtluongin, Inthiengna hi i in leh ân mawi a nih."
"O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.","Aw LALPA, nang phuba- lâkna thu neitu Pathien, Nang phubalâkna thuneitu Pathien, hung var suok rawh."
"Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud their desert.","Nang hnuoia rorêltu, thaw la, Chapohai chu an suol man thung rawh."
"Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?","LALPA, mi rilohai chu ieng chen am, Mi rilohai chun hnein ieng chen am an hlim ding a na?"
"They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.","Anni chu an ṭawng mei mei a, iniemtakin thu an hril a, Thil suksuoltuhai po po chu mâni an inpâk hlak."
"They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage.","Aw LALPA, i mihai chu an suknâwi neng a, I rochan chu an sukrinum hlak."
"They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless.","Hmeithai le mikhuol chu an sukhlum a, Pa neilo chu an that hlak."
"And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider.","“LALPA chun hmu naw nih a, Jakob Pathien chun ngaituo bawk naw ni,” an ti hlak a nih."
"Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise?","Mi laia mi ngawnghai ngaituo ro, Mi invêthai, iengtik am var in ti aw!"
"He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?",Na inbûktu chun a hriet naw ding am a nih? Mit siemtu chun a hmu naw ding am a nih?

"Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.","LALPA chun mihriem ngaituohai chu, Teplo mei mei a nih ti a hriet a."
"Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;","Mi i thunun a, i dân thua inthawka i inchûktir chu, Aw LALPA, a hamṭha."
"That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.","Mi rilo ta dinga khur choa a um hmakhat a, Lunginzîng nihaia châwlna i pêk theina dinga i închûktir chu."
"For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.","LALPA chun a mihai a pei thlâk âwm si nawh a, A rochan chu mâksan bawk naw nih."
For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.,"Rorêlna chu felna tieng kîr nawk a ta, Lungril indiktak put po po chun chu chu zui an tih."

"Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence.","LALPA chu a mi ṭhangpuitu ni naw sien la chu, Ka hringna hi hmun reah a um vak ta ding a nih."
"When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.","“Ka ke ân tlêu ie,” ka ti khan, Aw LALPA, i ngilneina chun a mi kei a."
In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.,"Ka lungrila ngaituo tamtak ka nei lai chun, I thlamuonna chun ka hringna hi a sukthafân hlak."
"Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?","Rîtlona lalṭhungpha, thuruota thil suksuolna siem hlaktu chun Inkawppuina che a nei ding am a nih?"
"They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.","Mi fel hringna thaw tumin an pungkhâwm tâwl hlak a, Thisen demkailo chu thiemnaw an inchangtir bawk hlak."
"But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu ka kulbîng insâng a lo na, Ka Pathien chu ka înhum- himna lungpui a lo nih."
"And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.","Ama chun anni suolna ngei chu an chungah ân tlâktir a, Anni ṭhat nawna ngeia chun sukbohmang a ta; LALPA ei Pathien chun sukbohmang a tih."

"For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods.","LALPA chu Pathien ropuitak a ni sih a, Pathien po po chungah Lal ropuitak a nih."
In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.,"Ama kuta chun hnuoi hmun inthûktakhai chu a um a, Tlâng sîp insângtakhai chu ama ta a ni bawk a."
"The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land.","Tuisuoriet hi a ta a nih, ama siem a ni sih a, Khawmuol khawm hi a kutsuok a nih."
"Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:","Aw hung unla, chibai bûkin kûn ei tiu, LALPA a mi Siemtu hmaah dingṭhaṭhuon ei tiu."
"For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!","Ama chu ei Pathien a na, Eini hi a ran tlatna hmuna mi le, a kuta berâmhai ei ni sih a. Vawisûn hin a râwl chu lo hre ta ve unla chu aw!"
"Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;","Meribaa an thaw ang khan in lungril sukngar naw ro, Thlalêra Massa ni ang khan;"
"When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work.","Chuong lai chun in thlatuhai chun an mi fieh a, Ka thilthaw an hmu sa khawmin an mi fieh a."
"Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways:","Kum sâwm li sûng zet chu, chu suonhai chunga chun ka lungninawh a, “An lungrila ngaisuol hmang mi an na, Ka lampuihai khawm an hriet nawh,” ka tih a."

"Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.","Hnam tin lai chun a ropuizie hril unla, Mi tinrênghai lai chun a thilmak thawhai hril ro."
"For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods.","LALPA chu a ropui a, nasataka inpâk ding a ni sih a, Pathien po po nêka ṭî ding a nih."
For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.,"Mipuihai pathienhai chu milimhai an ni sih a, LALPA ruok chun vânhai khi a siem a nih."
Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.,"Chawimawina le ropuina a hmaah an um a, Hrâtna le mawina chu a hmun inthiengah an um."
"Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.","Mi tina chi tinrênghai, LALPA kuomah pe unla, LALPA kuoma chun ropuina le hrâtna pe ro."

Clouds and darkness are round about him: Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.,"Sûmhai le inthim sâmup hi a vêlah a um a, Felna le rorêlna fel chu a lalṭhungpha innghatna a nih."
"A fire goeth before him, And burneth up his adversaries round about.","A hma tieng chun mei a feh a, A vêla ama dotuhai chu a kâng hmang hlak."
"His lightnings lightened the world: The earth saw, and trembled.","A kâwlinlephai chun khawvêl hi a el zawt zawt a, Hnuoi hin a hmuh a, ân thin a."
"The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.","Tlânghai chu khuoihlu ang hin LALPA hmaah an intui hmang tah a, Khawvêl po po LALPA hmaa chun."
"The heavens declare his righteousness, And all the peoples have seen his glory.","Vânhai khin a felna chu a tlânginsampui hlak a, Mi tinrêng chun a ropuizie an hmu tah a."
"Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods.","Milim siemfâwmhai rawngbâwl- tuhai po po chu muolphoin um raw se, Milimhai suongtuhai chu: Nangni pathien po pohai, ama chibai bûk ro."

"Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; And give thanks to his holy memorial name.","Mi felhai, LALPAA chun lâwmtakin um unla, A hming inthieng chu inpâk ro."
"Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.","Aw LALPA chawimawiin hla thar sak unla, Thil maktakhai a thaw ta sih a; A kut changtieng le a bân inthieng chun ama ta dingin sandamna a siempêk tah a."
Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.,"LALPA chun a sandamna chu ân hriettir a, A felna chu hnam tin mithmua chun chiengtakin ân langtir tah."
He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.,"Israel sûnghai chunga a ngilnei- zie le, a ringumzie chu a hriet zing a, Kâwlkawdawnga mi po po khawmin ei Pathien sandamna chu an hmu tah."

Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody.,"Ṭingṭang leh LALPA inpâkin hla sak ro, Ṭingṭang le inpâkna hla ri leh."
"With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.","Tawtawrâwthai le tawtawrâwt bi nei ri leh, Laltak, LALPA hmaa chun hlimtakin khêk ro."

Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together,"Tuilienhai chun an kut ben sienla, Tlânghai chu hlimin LALPA hmaa chun hla sak tâwl rawhai se."
"Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.","Hnuoi ro rêl dingin a hung ding a ni sih a, Khawvêl hi feltakin ro rêlpêk a ta; Thlierbîk nei loin mi tin ro chu rêl a tih."
Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved.,"LALPA chu lalah a ṭhung a, mi tin chu inthin raw se, Ama chu cherubhai chungah a ṭhung a, hnuoi hi inhnîng raw se."
Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples.,"LALPA chu Zion khaw sûnga chun ropuitak a na, Mi tinrênghai chunga chun a chunghnung dai a nih."
Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he.,"Anni chun i hming ropuitak, ṭîumtak chu inpâk raw se, Ama chu ân thieng a nih."
The king’s strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.,"Laltak hrâtna chun rorêlna a ngainah a, Nang chun thlierbîk nei nawna i sukdet hlak a, Nang chun Jakobrawihai chungah ro i rêl a, feltakin i thaw hlak a."
"Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he.","LALPA ei Pathien chu chawimawi unla, A ke innghatna bula chun chibai bûk ro, Ama chu ân thieng a nih."
"Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.","A thiempuhai lai chun Mosie le Aron, A hming lamtuhai laia chun Samuel, Anni chun LALPA chu an ko a, ama chun a dawn tah a."
"He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them.","Sûm ngîra chun an kuomah thu a hril a, A thuinhriettirhai le thuruot a pêk chu an zâwm a."
"Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.","Aw LALPA, kan Pathien, nang chun anni chu i dawn a, Nang chu anni ngaidamtu Pathien i nih, An thilthaw chungahai phuba la hlak la khawm."
"Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.","LALPA ei Pathien chu chawimawi unla, A tlâng inthienga chun chibai bûk ro; LALPA ei Pathien chu ân thieng sih a."
