"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.","Juda lal Jehoiakim rorêl kum thumnaa Babulon ram lal Nebu- kadnezzar chu Jerusalemah a hung a, a rûn tah a."
"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.","Chun, Juda lal Jehoiakim chu Pathien ina bûr le bêl ṭhenkhat leh Lalpa chun ama kuta chun a pêk tah a; Sinar rama a pathien ina chun a lâk a, chuong bûr le bêlhai chu a pa- thien sum ina chun a hung lâk tah a."
"And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles;","Chun, lal chun a mitillâkhai chunga hotu Aspenaz kuoma chun Israel nauhai mi ṭhenkhat lal chi ngei le miṭha chi ngei hung ṭhuoi dingin a hril a;"
"youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.","anni chu tleirâwl demkailo, ditumtak lem, varna po poa thiem, hrietna kawnga bengvâr, hrietna inthûktak hre mi, lal ina ngîr dinga theina nei mi an ni ding a na; chun, Kaldai ṭawng le thiemna ân chûktir bawk ding a nih."
"And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.","Lal chun kum thum sûng a châwm a, a tâwpa chun lal hmaa an ngîr theina dingin lal bu fâk le a uoin dâwn ngei chu ni tina an chanpuol dingin anni chu a ruotpêk a."
"Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.","Hieng hai laia Juda nauhai chu Daniel, Hanania, Misael le Azaria an nih."
"And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.","Chun, mitillâk hotu chun anni chu hming tharhai a pêk a; Daniel chu Beltesazzar ân bûk a, Hanania chu Sadrak, Misael chu Mesak, Azaria chu Abednego."
"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.","Nisienlakhawm, Daniel chun a lungrilin lal bu fâk le a uoin dâwnhai chun ama chu insukpawrche lo a tum tlat a: chuongchun, mitillâkhai hotu kuoma chun ama chu ân sukpawrche naw theina ding kawng chu a hni a."
Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.,"Chun, Pathien chun Daniel chu mitillâkhai hotu mithmua lungin- sietna le ditsakna hlaw thei dingin a siem a."
"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.","Chun, mitillâkhai hotu chun Daniel kuoma chun, “Lal, in dâwn ding le in bu fâk ding ruotpêktu cheu ka lalpa chu ka ṭi a nih, i kum inangpui tleirâwl danghai nêka se lemin i hmêl chu a hmu si naw ding am a nih? Chuong a ni chun, lal kuomah ka lu hi ṭitumtakah i sie a ni ding a nih,” a ta."
"Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:","Daniel chun mitillâkhai hotuin anni Daniel, Hanania, Misael le Azaria vêngtu dinga a ruot, Ham- melzar kuoma chun,"
"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.","“Ka ngên che hi, i siehlawhai hi ni sâwm sûng ensin raw khai; fâk dingin thlai chau le dâwn dingin tui chau mîn pêktir la."
"Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.","Chun, tleirâwl dang lal bu fâk fahai hmêlput dân le, keini hmêlput dânhai chu enkhi ni raw se; chun, chutaka i hmu ang ang chun, i sie- hlawhai hi i law law law el rawh,” a ta."
"So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.","Chuongchun, hi chungchâng thuah anni thu chu a ngai a, ni sâwm sûng chu a ensin tah a."
"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s dainties.",Ni sâwm hnunga chun tleirâwl dang lal bu fâk fatuhai po po nêk chun an hmêlput dânhai chu a hung inlang ṭha lem tah a.
"So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.","Chuongchun, anni vêngtu chun an bu fâk ding le uoin an dâwn ding chu a sie hmang a, thlai chau a pêk lem tah a."
"Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.","Chun, hieng tleirâwlhai pali hi Pathien chun varna le thiemna po poa bengvarna le hrietna a pêk a; chun, Daniel chun thilhmulâwkhai le manghai chung po poa chun hriet- thiemna a nei a."
"And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.","Chun, lalin anni hung ṭhuoi- lûtna dinga a ruot nihai tâwpa chun mitillâkhai hotu chun anni chu Nebukadnezzar hmaa chun a hung ṭhuoi tah a."
"And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.","Lal chun anni chu a lo biek tâwl a, an rênga lai chun Daniel hai, Hanania hai, Misael hai le Azaria hai ang tukhawm an um nawh a, chulei- in, anni chu lal hmaa chun an ngîr tah a."
"And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.","Chun, varna le hrietthiemna kawng tinrêngah, lalin a indawn ta hrim hrima chun, a ram sûnga aisân- thiemhai le mitvaidawi thiemhai po po nêka le sâwma var lemin anni chu a hriet a."
And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.,"Chun, Daniel lem chu Kura inlal kum khatna chenin a um zing tah a."
"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.","Persia lal Kura inlal kum thumnaa chun a hming Belte- sazzar inbûk, Daniel kuomah thil suklangin a um a, chu thil chu thil indik, indona ropuitak a na, chu thil chu a hriet a, thilhmulâwk chu hriet- thiemna a nei bawk a."
"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.",Chuong nihai lai chun kei Daniel hi hapta thum zet chu lungngaiin ka um a.
"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.","Bei inhnikin ka fâk nawh a, sa le uoin hrim hrim khawm ka bauah a lût nawh a, hriek hrim hrim khawm kân nâl ngai nawh a, hapta thum pumhlûm a tling hmakhat chun."
"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,","Chun, thla hmasatak ni sâwmhni pali ni chun, Hiddekel vadung ropui- tak panga ka um lai chun,"
"I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:","ka mithai vân tieng ka hang inlên a, ka en a, mi pakhat puon zai inhmia inthuom, a kâwnga Uphaz rângka- chak inthienga inkhit hi ka hmuh a;"
"his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.","a taksa khawm chu berul lung ang a na, a hmêl inlang dân chu kâwlinlep ang a na, a mithai chu khâwnvar chawklai ang an na, a kuthai le a kehai chu dârsen tlemi ang an na, a thu hril rihai chu mi tamtak râwlri ang a nih."
"And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.","Chun, kei Daniel chau chun chu thilhmulâwk chu ka hmuh a; ka kâwla mi um vehai chun thilhmu- lâwk chu an hmu ve nawh a; ami- ruokchu, inthinna nasatak an chung- ah a tlah a, anni chu inbi dingin an tlân tah a."
"So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.","Chuongchun, ka khât chaua mâksanin ka um a, hi thilhmulâwk ropuitak hi ka hmu tah a; chun, keimaa chun hrâtna hrim hrim a um ta nawh a: ka hmêl mawina chu sietnaa ân chang ta leiin, hrâtna hrim ka nei ta nawh a."
"Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.","A thuhril ri chu ka la hriet ta rawp a: chun, a thuhril ri chu ka hriet phingleh, hnuoitienga ka hmai in- nghatin ka bawkkhup a, inhniktakin ka in tah a."
"And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.","Chun, ngai ta, kutin a mi hung them a, chuongchun, dingṭhaṭhuonin ka bawkinvâk a."
"And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Aw nang nasataka ditsaka umpa Daniel, i kuoma ka thuhrilhai chu a ngaina hre la, ngîr inzang rawh; tuhin i kuoma hung tir ka ni sih a,” a ta. Hi thu hi ka kuoma a hung hril phing chun inthin pumin ka ngîr tah a."
"Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words’ sake.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Daniel ṭi naw rawh, i Pathien hmaa nang le nang în sukhnuoi a, a ngaina hre dinga i lungril i siem nia inthawk khan i thuhai chu hriet a lo ni tah a, i thuhai lei chun hi ka hung a nih."
"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.","Nisienlakhawm, Persia ram lal chun ni sâwmhni pakhat sûng chu a mi lo dangkîr a; amiruokchu, ngai ta, Mikael hotu laia lutak pakhat chu kei mi ṭhangpui dingin a hung a; chuong- chun, Persia ram lalhai le chun chutaka chun ka um zing tah a."
Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.,"Ni nuhnungahai chun i mihai chu iengin am a hung tlâkbuok ding a na ti inhriettir ding chein tuhin ka hung a nih; thilhmulâwk kha ni tamtakhaia ding a la ni chau sih a,” a ta."
"And when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.","Chun, hieng thuhai ang peia ka kuoma thu a hung hril chun, ka hmai chu hnuoi tieng ka kûn a, ṭawng- theiloin ka um tah a."
"And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat, mi- hriem naupahai angtak el hin ka hmûrhai chu a hung them a; chun, ka bau chu ka kah a, ka hmaa ngîr kuoma chun thu ka hril tah a, “Aw ka lalpa, thilhmulâwk lei chun ka lung- ngainahai chu ka chungah a tla tah a, chuongchun, hrâtna hrim ka nei dêr ta nawh."
"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.","Hi ka lalpa siehlaw hin hi ka lalpa kuoma hin iengtin am thu hril thei ka ta? Kei hlak chu kârloin hrâtna hrim nei loin ka um el sih a, keimaa chun inthuokna hrim hrim khawm a um ta bawk si nawh a,” ka tih a."
"Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.","Chun, mihriem hmêl angtak put pakhat hin a mi hung them nâwk a; a mi sukhrât tah a."
"And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.","Ama chun, “Aw nasataka dit- saka umpa, ṭi naw rawh, i kuomah thlamuongna um raw se; insukhrât rawh, anih, insukhrât rawh,” a ta. Chun, ka kuoma thu a hung hril phing chun sukhrâtin ka um tah a, “Ka lalpa hin thu hril raw se, i mi sukhrât ta sih a,” ka ta."
"Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.","Chun, ama chun, “I kuomah iengdinga hung am ka na ti i hriet am? Tuhin Persia lal chu do dingin kîr nâwk ka ta; chun, ka fe suok pha chun, ngai ta, Grik ram lal chu hung a tih."
"But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.","Nisienlakhawm, thudik ziek- naa ziek chu hril ka ti che: hi thil chungchâng thua hin, i lalpa Mikael ti chau naw chu tukhawm a mi ṭan zo hrim hrim an um nawh."
"And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.","“Chun, kei chu, Median mi Daria kum khatna kum chun ama chu sukhrâta sukdet dingin ka ngîr tah a."
"And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.","“Chun, tuhin thudik chu inentir ka ti che. Ngai ta, Persiaa hin lal pathum la hung ngîrsuok an ta; a palina chu anni po po nêk chun nasatakin hausa lem a tih: chun, a hausakna leia a hung hrât chun, Grik ram do dingin mi po po chawktho a tih."
"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.","Chun, lal thilthawtheitak, ram ropuitaka rorêltu ding chu hung ngîrsuok a ta, a nuom ang ang chu hung thâwng a tih."
"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.","A hung ngîrsuok phingle chun a ram chu sukkhawi nîng a ta, kawlkil palihai anga chun sem dar nîng a tih; a thlahai amani le a rorêlna ram dungzui chun ni chuong naw nih a, a ram chu hieng mihai titâk lo khawm mi danghai ta ding khawma suk- thlawng a ni ding a ni sih a."
"And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.","“Chun, simtieng lal chu hung hrât a ta, a lalhai laia pakhat leh; ama nêk chun hung hrât a ta, lal ram chu hung nei a tih; a lal ram chu ram ropuitak hung ni bawk a tih."
"And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.","Kum iengzât amani hnunga chun anni chu hung inzawm khâwm an ta, simtienga lal naunu chu hmârtienga lal kuoma chun inremna siem dingin hung a tih; nisienlakhawm, a kut hrâtna chu nei sawng naw nih; amapa chu ngîr naw nih a, a kut khawm châng bawk naw ni; nisien- lakhawm, chuong nihaia amanu lo sukhrâttu le amanu lo thlatupa le, ama hung ṭhuoituhai chu amanu le chun bânsanin um an tih."
"But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.","Nisienlakhawm, a zunghai puok- suoka inthawkin mi pakhat a hmuna chun hung ngîrsuok a ta, ama chu sipai pâwl leh hung a ta, hmârtieng lal kula chun hung lût a ta, anni chu do a ta, hne bawk a tih;"
"And also their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.","an pathienhai le, an milim sunga sunghai le, an tangkaruo le rângka- chak bûrlebêl ṭhatak takhai chu râllâkin Aigupta rama chun phur hmang bawk a tih; chun, kum tam lem sûng chu hmârtieng lal nêkin inlal a tih."
"And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.","“Chun, simtieng lal rama chun hung lût a ta, nisienlakhawm, ama rama bawk kîr nâwk a tih."
"And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.","A naupasalhai chun sipai ropui- tak tamtak el khâwm an ta, do an ta, chu chu hung an ta, a luongin hung luong liem an ta, fe thleng an tih; chun, hung kîr nâwk an ta, a kul ngei chu hung do an tih."
"And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.","Chun, simtieng lal nasataka suklungsenin um a ta, hung suok a ta, hmâr tieng lal ngei chu hung do a tih; chun, mipui nasatak chu hung tir suok a ta, chu mipui nasatak chu a kutah pêk nîng a tih."
"And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.","Chun, mipui chu ṭhuoi hmang hung nîng an ta, ama chu a lungril chu hung inchawisâng a ta, sâng sâwm tamtak chu hung pei thlûng a ta, nisienlakhawm, hrât pha ngai naw ni."
"And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.","Hmâr tieng lal chu hung kîr nâwk a ta, a hmasa nêka mi tam lem chu hung ṭhuoi a ta; chun, kumhai tâwpah, hunhai tâwpa chun sipai nasatak le hausakna tamtak leh hung a tih."
And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.,"“Chuong hun haia chun sim- tieng lal chunga chun mi tamtak hung ngîrsuok an ta, i mihai laia dân hmanglo mihai ngei khawm thilhmu- lâwk chu hung suktlung dingin hung inmawrkâng an ta, nisienlakhawm, tlûng an tih."
"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.","Chun, hmârtieng lal chu hung a ta, tlâng hung siem a ta, khawpui kulnei khawm chu hung lâng a tih; simtieng kuthai chun dangkîr naw nih a, a mi thlanghai khawmin, a dang kîr zo ding hrâtna hrim hrim um naw ni."
"But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.","Chuongchun, ama hung rûntu- hai chu a nuom nuom lo lâwng a ta, ama hmaa chun tukhawm ngîr thei naw ni hai: ram ropuia chun ngîr a ta, a kuta chun suksietna um bawk a tih."
"And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.","A hmêl chu amaa mi ngîlhai le, a ram pumpui hrâtna le hung dingin nghâng a ta; a nuom nuom thâwng a ta, nuhmei naunuhai chu sukkhaw- hlo dingin ama chu pêng a ta; ni- sienlakhawm, amanu chu a kuomah ngîr naw nih a, a ta ni thei bawk naw ni."
"After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.","Hi hnunga hin, thlierkâr tienga chun nghâng a ta; tamtak chu lâng a tih; nisienlakhawm, sipai hotu chun zilna amain a pêk chu suktâwp a ta, anih, chu naw khawm chu, a zilna chu ama chungah inumtir bawk a tih."
"Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.","Chun, ama rama kul tieng ngei chu nghâng a ta; nisienlakhawm, insui a ta, tlûng a ta, ama chu hmu ni ta ngai naw ni."
"Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.","“Chun, ama hmuna chun mi pakhat, ram ropuinaa leiman khawna infethlengtirtu ding chu hung ngîrsuok a ta, nisienlakhawm, in- dona amanih, lunginsenna amani khawm ni loin, ama chu ni sâwt- nawtêah sukbohmang nîng a tih."
"And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.","Chun, ama hmuna chun mi hmusitumtak hung ngîrsuok a ta, ama kuoma chun ram ropuina chu pêk ni naw ni; nisienlakhawm, muongna hun laitak hung a ta, simbudawiin ram chu lâng a tih."
"And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.","Ama hmaa chun tuilêt hrâtnain anni chu la hmang a ta, suksiet nîng an tih; anih, thuthlung hotu ngei khawm chu suksiet nîng a tih."
"And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.","Chun, ama le inzawmna siem a ni hnung chun, hmusitumtakin sin thâwng a ta; ama chu mi tlâwmte leh hung a ta, a hrât hle ding a ni sih a."
"In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.","Inrem lai huna chun ram buoina um nawna hmun hmunahai chun hung a ta, a thlatuhai thlatu- hai amani, a thlatuhaiin amani thil an thaw ngailo chu hung thâwng a tih; chun, anni lai chun hausak- na dâm, râllâk thil dâm le râl- that dâm chu the dar a ta; anih, vawikhat nana na chu a tumnahai chu kul dettak tieng chu innghat a tih."
And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.,"Chun, sipai ropuitak leh a thilthawtheina le a huoina chu simtieng lal chunga chun chawktho a ta; simtieng lal chun ama chu sipai hrâttak le ropuitak el le chun indonaa chun do a ta; nisienlakhawm, ngîr zo naw nih, ama chunga chun rem chu a lo ruot ding a ni leiin."
"Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.","Anih, ama bu fatuhai chun ama chu suksieng an ta, a sipaihai chu a luongin luong liem an ta; mi tamtak chu sukhluma umin tlûng an tih."
"And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.","Chun, hi lal hai ve ve hi chu; an lungrilhai chu thil suol thawna lung- ril nîng a ta; dawkân hmunkhata chun thukhêlhai hril an tih; nisien- lakhawm, hlawtling naw nih a, a tâwpna chu hun ruota chun a la ni ding a ni sih a."
"Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land.","Chun, ama rama chun thuom- hnaw tamtak le chun kîr nâwk a ta; a lungril chu Thuthlung Inthieng kal zâwng ni tâng a ta, a nuom ang angin thâwng a tih; chun, ama ram bawka chun kîr nâwk a tih."
"At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.","“Hun ruota chun hung kîr nâwk a ta, simtieng hung a tih; nisien- lakhawm, a hun nuhnung lema chun a hun hmasa lem ang kha ni ta naw ni."
"For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.","Kittima lawnghai chun ama an hung rûn ding a ni sih a; chuleiin, lungngai a ta, hung kîr nâwk a ta, Thuthlung Inthieng chunga chun lunginsenna nei a ta, a nuom ang angin thâwng a tih; kîr nâwk a ta, chuong Thuthlung Inthieng nghat- santuhai chu ngaisak a tih."
"And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt-offering, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.","Sipaihai chu ama tieng chun ngîr an ta, Hmun Inthiengtak chu hrilsieng an ta, kulpui ngei khawm chu; chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân zing zing chu la hmang an ta, sukrêmna intluntu tirdakumna chu sie lem an tih."
"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.","Chuonga Thuthlung chunga khawhlotaka thawin, simbudawiin suk hmingsieng a tih; nisienla- khawm, chuong mihai an Pathien hretuhai chu hung hrât an ta, thil nasatak hung thâwng an tih."
"And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days.","Chun, mihai laia a varhai chun, mi tamtak inchûktir an ta; ni tamtak sûng, râllâk le, sala manin mei le kâwlhnâmin tlûng an tih."
"Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.","An tlûk pha chun, anni chu ṭhangpuina tlâwmtêa ṭhangpui nîng an ta; nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak chun anni chu simbudawiin hung zâwm an tih."
"And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.","Chun, chuong a varhai chu hun tâwpa chun anni chu sukvar ding le, sukfai ding le, sukṭha dingin tlûng an tih; hun ruota ding chu a la ni leiin."
"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.","“Chun, lal chun a nuom ang angin thâwng a ta, ama le ama chu inchawimawi a ta, pathien po po chunga chun ama chu inchawisâng a tih; chun, pathienhai Pathien chu kalin thil râpthlâktak takhai chu hril a tih, thaw dinga tum ta po chu thaw a ni ding a na, lunginsenna chu hrîk- thlâk a ni hmakhat chu hlawtling pei a tih."
"Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.","Nuhmeihai châkna amanih, a thlatuhai pathienhai amani khawm chu ngaisak naw nih a, pathien hrim hrim ngaisak naw ni, chuong chung po poa chun ama chu ân chawisâng ding a ni sih a."
"But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones and pleasant things.","Nisienlakhawm, ama hmuna chun kulhai pathien chu inza thung a ta, a thlatuhaiin pathien an hriet ngainaw chu thil ṭhahai le, lungman- tamhai le, tangka le rângkachakin chawimawi a tih."
"And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth him he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.","Chun, pathien danglam ṭhang- puiin kulhai chu thâwng a ta, tukhawm ama hrefu taphawt chu ropuina sukpungpêk a ta, mi tamtak chunga rorêltu dingin siem a ta, ram chu man neiin sem dar bawk a tih."
"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.","Chun, hun tâwpa chun simtieng lal chun ama chu nawr a ta; hmâr- tieng lal chun lawng tamtakhai leh, sakawr chung chuong mihai leh, sakawr tawlailîrhai leh phaivaw hrâng ang elin ama chu hung rûn a tih; chun, ramhaia chun hung lût a ta, palzêl a ta, fe thleng a tih."
"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.","Ram ropuia khawm chun hung lût a ta, ram tamtak chu hne hung nîng an tih; nisienlakhawm, hieng Edom hai, Moab hai, Ammon thlahai lal hi a kuta inthawk chun sansuok nîng an tih."
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.,Ramhai chunga chun a kut chu inlet a ta; Aigupta ram khawm chun pumpel bîk naw ni.
"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.","Nisienlakhawm, Aigupta rama thil hluhai po po le, tangka le rângkachak ro bâwmhai chunga chun thuneina nei a ta; Libua mihai le Ethiopia mihai chu a kaiza vêng chun um an tih."
But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.,"Nisienlakhawm, saktieng le hmârtienga thuthanghai chun ama chu sukbuoi an ta, mi tamtak chu sukbohmang dêr ding le sukse dingin lunginsentakin fe suok a tih."
"And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.","Chun, a lal chêngna puon in chu tlâng inthienga tuisuoriet inkâra chun kei a ta; nisienlakhawm, a tâwpna tlung tho a tih, tukhawma ama chu an ṭhangpui si nawh a."
"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.","“Chu pha chun lal naupa ropuitak Mikael, i mihai ta dinga ngîr chu ngîrsuok a ta; chun, buoina hun chu a hung um ding a nih, hnam um tira inthawka chu chu hun chena khawm la um ngai hrim hrim lo chu; chu pha chun, i mihai, lekha- bua zieka hmu taphawthai chu sanhim nîng an tih."
"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.","Chun, mi tamtak hnuoi pilvuta lo in tahai chu tho an ta, aṭhen chu chatuona hringna changin, aṭhen ruok chu chatuona thiemnaw le inzakna changin."
And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.,"Chun, mi varhai chu vâna var ang khin var tâng an ta; chun, mihai felna tienga lo ṭhuoi lûttuhai chu chatuonin arasihai angin var tâng an tih."
"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.","Nisienlakhawm, nang aw Daniel, hun tâwp chena dingin thuhai chu khâr la, lekhabu chu châr tlat rawh: mi tamtak chu hnungtieng hmatieng tlân an ta, hrietna chu a pung ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
"Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.","Chun, kei Daniel chun ka en a; chun, ngai ta, mi dang pahni, pakhat chu vadung pang khingtieng sîrah, a dang chu vadung pang khingtieng sîrah, an lo ngîr a."
"And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?","Chun, pakhat chun vadung tui- hai chunga um, puon zai inhmia inthuompa kuoma chun, “Hieng thilmakhai tâwpna chu iengtik am nîng a ta?” a ta."
"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.","Chun, puon zai inhmia inthuom, vadung tuihai chunga ngîr chun a kut changtieng le vawitieng chu vân tieng a phar a, chatuona Hring kuoma chun inkhâmin, “Hun khat le, hunhai le, hun chenve sûng nîng a tih; chun, mi inthienghai thil- thawtheina chu a nâwia suknâwi vawng chu an zo pha chun hieng thil po po hi thaw zo ni tâng a tih,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?","A ri chu ka hriet a, a ngaina ruok chu ka hriet nawh a; chun, kei chun, “Aw ka LALPA, hieng thilhai tâwpna chu ieng am nîng a ta?” ka ta."
"And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.","Ama chun, “Daniel, fe el rawh, hun tâwp chena dingin hieng thuhai hi khârkhum tlat le chârde tlat an ni sih a."
"Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand.","Mi tamtak chu anni le anni insukthieng an ta, insukvâr an ta, insukthieng an tih; nisienlakhawm, mi khawhlohai chun khawhlotakin thâwng an ta; mi khawhlohai tu- khawmin hrethiem naw ni hai; amiruokchu, a varhai chun hrethiem an tih."
"And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân rawp hi lâk hmang le, sukrêmna tirdakum intluntu uma inthawkin ni sâng khat za hni sâwmkuo um a tih."
"Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.","Inring zinga, ni sâng khat za thum sâwmthum pangaa lût chu a hamṭha."
"But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot, at the end of the days.","Nisienlakhawm, nang chu fe pei la, a tâwp a tlung hma chun, ni tâwpa- hai chun châwl i ta, i chantâwka chun i ngîr ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.","Chun, Nebukadnezzarin ro a rêl a, a kum hninaa chun Nebukad- nezzar chun manghai a mang tah a, a lungril chu a hung buoi tah a, in khawm a in ṭha thei ta nawh a."
"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.","Chun, lal chun a manghai chu hrilfie dingin mitvaidawithiemhai, aisânthiemhai, dawithiemhai le Kal- dai mihai chu ko dingin thu a pêk tah a. Chuongchun, anni chu an hung lût a, lal hmaa chun an ngîr tah a."
"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.","Lal chun an kuomah, “Mang ka nei a, chu mang chu hre suok nâwk dingin ka lungril a buoi ngawt el a nih,” a ta."
"Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.","Chun, Kaldai mihai chun lal kuoma chun Suria ṭawngin, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh: i sie- hlawhai hi mang chu mi hril la, a umzie chu hril el kan ti che,” an ta."
"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, Kaldai mihai kuoma chun, “Chu thil chu keimaa inthawkin a fe hmang tlat tah a: mang le hrilfiena chu in mîn hriet- tir naw chun sât nawi vawng nîng in ta, in inhai chu êk pei khâwmna hmuna siem ni bawk a tih."
"But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.","Nisienlakhawm, mang le a hril- fiena chu in mîn hriettir thei chun keimaa inthawkin thilpêkhai le lâwmmanhai le inzaumna nasatak hai hmûng in tih; chuleiin, mang le a hrilfiena chu mîn hmutir ro,” a ta."
"They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.","Chun, an dawn nâwk a, “Lal chun a siehlawhai hi mang chu hril phawt raw se, chun a hrilfiena chu hril kan tih,” an ta."
"The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, “Chu thil chu keimaa inthawkin a fe hmang tlat tah ti in hmu lei hin, chu chu hun remchâng takah in hmang a nih ti ka hriet suok ngei a nih."
"But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.","Nisienlakhawm, mang chu in mîn hriettir naw chun, in ta dingin dân pakhat chau a um a nih: hun a hung inthleng hmakhat chu ka hmaa hin thu sie le khêl hril dingin in inbuotsai a ni sih a; chuleiin, mang chu mi hril unla; chun mang chu a hrilfiena in mîn entir thei ngei a nih ti ka hriet ding annâwm,” a ta."
"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.","Kaldai mihai chun lal chu an dawn a, “Hnuoi chung hrim hrima hin lal chungchâng thu hi ân entir thei ding tukhawm an um nawh: chu- nâksapah, lal khawmin, laltak khawmin, rorêltu khawmin hieng ang thil hi mitvaidawithiemhai ama- nih, aisânthiemhai amanih, Kaldai mihai kuoma mani khawm an indawn ngai hrim hrim nawh."
"And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.","Lal thil dit dân hi thil vângkhat tak a nih; tisaa chêng nilo pathienhai ti chau naw chu tukhawm lal hmaa inentir thei ding hrim hrim an um nawh,” an ta."
"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.","Hi thil chunga hin lal chu a lunginsen a, ṭi a um ta êm êm a, Babulona mi var po pohai chu sukbo- hmang dingin thu a pêk tah a."
"So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.","Chuongchun, thupêk chu a fe suok tah a, mi varhai chu sukhlum ding an lo ni tah a; Daniel le a ruolhai khawm chu sukhlum dingin an zawng tah a."
"Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;","Chun, Daniel chun, lal vêngtu sipai pâwl hotu Ariok, Babulon rama mi varhai sukhlum dinga fe suoktu kuoma chun varna le thurâwnna dawnnain a lo râwn tah a;"
"he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.","lal sipai hotu Ariok chu a dawn a, “Lala inthawka thupêk iengdinga pawimaw êm êm am a nih a?” a ta. Chun, Ariok chun Daniel kuoma chun thil chu ân hriettir a."
"And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.","Chun, Daniel chu a va lût a, ama chu hun ruotpêk a, a mang umzie chu lal chu inentir dingin lal chu a ngên a."
"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:","Chun, Daniel chu a ina chun a va feh a, a ruolhai Hanania hai, Misael hai, Azaria hai chu thil chu ân hriettir tah a;"
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.,"Babulona mi var danghai lai chun Daniel le a ruolhai chu an thi ve nawna dinga, hi thurûk chungchâng thua hin vâna Pathien zângaina chu an ngên theina dingin."
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.,"Chun, zâna thilhmulâwkin Daniel kuoma chun chu thurûk chu phuongin a um tah a. Chun, Daniel chun vâna Pathien chu ân pâk tah a."
"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.","Daniel chun a dawn a, “Pathien hming chu chatuon chatuon chenin inpâkin um raw se, Varna le hrâtna dâm chu ama ta a ni sih a."
"And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;","Hunhai le hunbihai chu a sukdanglam a, Lalhai chu a suktlâwmin lalhai chu a tungding a; Mi varhai kuoma chun varna a pêk a, hrietna neihai kuoma chun hrietthiemna a pêk bawk a;"
"he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.","Thurûkhai le thil inthûk- hai chu an kuomah a phuong a, Inthima thil um chu a hriet a, var chu amaa chun a um a nih."
"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter.","Aw nang kan thlatuhai Pathien, varna le hrâtna mi petu, Kân pâk cheh a, i kuomah lâwmthu ka hung hril hi, Kan hung ngên chu i mîn hriettir tah a, Lal thu chungchâng hi kan kuomah i hung inhriettir ta sih a,” tiin."
"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.","Chuongchun, Daniel chu lalin Babulona mi varhai sukbohmang dinga a ruot Ariok kuoma chun a va lût a, a va feh a, a kuoma chun, “Babulona mi varhai hi sukbohmang naw rawh; lal kuoma chun mi ṭhuoi lût la, mang umzie chu lal chu inentir ka tih,” a ta."
"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.","Chun, Ariok chun Daniel chu lal hmaa chun inhmâwtakin a hung ṭhuoi lût a, a kuoma chun, “Juda ram mi sal intânghai lai hin, a mang umzie lal chu inhriettir ding mi pakhat ka hmu suok tah,” a ta."
"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?","Lal chun a dawn a, Daniel, a hming Beltesazzar kuoma chun, “Mang ka ihmu tâk le a umzie chu nang hin i mîn hriettir thei ding maw?” a tih a, ân dâwn a."
"Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;","Daniel chun lal hmaa chun a dawn a, “Thurûk lalin a iphût hi mi varhaiin amani, aisânthiemhaiin amani, mitvaidawithiemhaiin amani, vânghriltuhaiin amani khawm lal chu inentir thei naw ni hai;"
"but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:","amiruokchu, vânah Pathien, thurûkhai phuongtu chu a um a, ama chun lal Nebukadnezzar chu ni nuhnunga thil um dinghai chu ân hriettir a nih. I mang le i khum chunga i lua i thil hmulâwkhai chu hienghi an nih:"
"as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.","nanga ta ding chun, aw lalpa, hi hnunga thil la hung tlung dinghai chu i khum chungah i ngaituonahai chu i lungrilah a hung lût a nih; thurûkhai phuongtu chun thil la hung tlung ding chu ân hriettir che a ni chu."
"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.","Keima chungthua chun, mi dang hrim nêka varna ka hau lem leia hi thurûk hi phuong a ni nawh a; amiruokchu, a umzie chu lal kuoma inhriettir a ni theina ding le i lungrila i ngaituohai chu i hriet theina dingin a ni lem."
"Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.","Aw lalpa, ngai ta, milim ropuitak el i hmuh a, i en zing a. Chu milim nasatak el le, a varna nasatak el chu i hmaa chun a ngîr a; a hmêl- putzie chu râpthlâktak el a na."
"As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,","Hi milim chung thu chu, a lu chu rângkachak inthieng a na, a âwm le a bânhai chu tangkaruo a nih; a phîng le, a êlpuihai chu dârsen a na,"
"its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.","a kehai chu thîr a na, a kepha- hai chu a ṭhen thîr, a ṭhen chu bepil a nih."
"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.","Chun, kut loin lungpui a hung insât thlâk a, chu milim thîr le pil kehaia ngîr chu a hung del a, nawi tamtaka a suknawi vawng chen i en a."
"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.","Chun, thîr dâm, pil dâm, dârsen dâm, tangkaruo dâm le rângkachak dâm chu inang rawngin an innawi tah a; nipui laia hrizâwlhaia busi ang el an hung ni tah a; chun, anni ta ding hrimin hmun hmu a ni ta nawh a, thli chun a lên hmang vawng tah a; chun, kha lung milim deltu kha tlâng ropuitak a hung na, khawvêl po po a hluo sip tah a."
This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.,"Hi hi mang chu a na, chu chu umzie chu lal hmaa hin kan hril ding a nih."
"Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;","Aw lalpa, nang chu lalhai lal, vâna Pathienin ram dâm, thilthaw- theina dâm, hrâtna dâm le ropuina dâm a pêk che chu i nih;"
"and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.","mihriem nauhai chêngna ta- phawt le, ramhnuoia ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai umna taphawt chu i kutah a pêk vawng a, an rênga chunga chun rorêl dingin a siem cheh a: chuongchun, nang chu rângkachak lu chu i nih."
"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.","Chun, nanga hnunga hin ram dang nanga nêka chîn lem la hung suok a ta; chun, ram pathumna dârsen chun khawvêl chung po poa rorêlna chu nei a tih."
"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.","Chun, ram palina chu thîr anga hrât nîng a ta; thîr chu a nawiin ân nawi tah a, thil po po hne angin; chu thîr chuong thil po po suknâwitu ang chu nawi tamtakah sukdar nîng a ta, râwtnawi la nîng a tih."
"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.","Chun, a kehai le a kepârhai chu aṭhen bêlhemtu pil le aṭhen thîra i hmu ang khan, ram inṭhe hung nîng a tih, nisienlakhawm, bepil chu thîr le inpawla i hmu ang tak khan amaa chun thîr hrâtna chu um a tih."
"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.","Chun, kehai, kepârhai chu aṭhen thîr a na, aṭhen chu pil a ni ang khan, chu ram khawm chu aṭhena chu hrât hlêng a ta, aṭhena chu hrât naw hlêng a tih."
"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.","Chun, thîr chu bepil inhnâk le inpawla i hmu ang tak khan anni chu mihriem chiah inchawkpawl an ta; nisienlakhawm, thîr chun pil chu ân pâwlpui thei naw ang bawkin anni chu inzawm tlat naw ni hai."
"And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.","Chun, chuong lalhai huna chun vâna Pathien chun suksieta um ta ngailo ding le, lal nina chu mi dang kuoma pêka um ta ngai lo ding ram pakhat hung siem suok a ta; chuong- chun, chuong ramhai chu kawi tam- taka hung sukkawiin, hung kâng- hmang a ta, kumkhuoin ama chu um ta lem a tih."
"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.","Chun, tlânga inthawka lung chu kuthai ṭhang lova sât thlâka uma, thîr dâm, dârsen dâm, pil dâm, tangkaruo dâm le rângkachak dâm chu a nâwia a sukkawi i hmu ta ang khan, Pathien ropuitak chun hi hnunga thil hung um ding lal kuoma chun a hung inhriettir a ni hi; mang chu indik ngei a ta, a umzie khawm chu indik bawk a tih,” a ta."
"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.","Chun, lal Nebukadnezzar chu a bawkkhup a, Daniel chu chibai a bûk a, ama kuoma chun riminhnikhai le inthâwina inhlân dingin thu a pêk tah a."
"The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.","Chun, lal chun Daniel chu a dawn a, “Indiktakin, i Pathien chu pathienhai Pathien, lalhai Lalpa, hi thurûk hi i phuong theizie hmu hrim hin, thurûkhai phuongtu chu a ni ngei hi,” a ta."
"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.","Chun, lal chun Daniel chu ropuitakin a siem a, thilpêk ropui- takhai a pêk a, Babulon rama mi var po po chunga hotu tak le Babulon biel sûng po poa rorêl dingin a siem tah a."
"And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.","Chun, Daniel chun lal chu a hnih a, ama chun Sadrak hai, Mesak hai, Abednego hai chu Babulon chungchâng thuha hotu dingin a ruot a. Daniel ruok chu lal rorêlna ina chun a um ta lem a."
"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.","Lal Nebukadnezzar chun rângka- chak milim a siem a, ân sângzie chu tawng sâwmruk a na, a khang- tieng chu tawng ruk a nih; Babulon biel sûnga Dura phaizâwla chun ân ngîrtir tah a."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.","Chun, lal Nebukadnezzarin mi- lim ân ngîrtir chu inhlân dinga hung dingin, lal Nebukadnezzar chun biel awptuhai, ram awptuhai, sipaihotu- hai, lalhai, tangka sum enkawltuhai, rorêltuhai, dân hre mihai le ram bunga rorêltuhai po po chu a ko khâwm vawng a."
"Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.","Chun, biel awptuhai, ram awp- tuhai, sipaihotuhai, lalhai, tangka sum enkawltuhai, rorêltuhai le dân hre mihai le ram bunga rorêltuhai po po chu lal Nebukadnezzarin milim ân ngîrtir inhlânnaa chun an hung khâwm vawng a; chuongchun, Nebu- kadnezzarin milim ân ngîrtir hmaa chun an ngîr tâwl a."

"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.","Chuleiin, chu lai chun, mipuihai chun tawtawrâwt dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm, rawsem dâm, per- khuong le rimawi tinrênghai ri chu an hriet chun, mipui po po le, hnam po pohai le, ṭawng po pohai chu lal Nebukadnezzarin rângkachak milim ân ngîrtir hmaa chun an bawkkhup a, chibai an bûk tah a."
"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.","Chuongchun, chu lai chun, Kaldai mi ṭhenkhat an hung hnai a, Juda mihai chungah hêkna an hung siem tah a."
"They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.","Anni chun lal Nebukadnezzar kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh."

"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.","Juda mi ṭhenkhat hieng Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai Babulon biel sûng chungchâng thua hotua i ruothai kha, khânghai rawi khan, aw lalpa, an pawisa naw che a nih, i pathienhai rawng chu an bâwl nawh a, rângkachak milim în ngîrtir khawm kha chibai an bûk bawk nawh,” an ta."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.

"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?","Nebukadnezzar chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Aw Sadrak, Mesak, Abednego, ka pathien rawng chu in bâwl nawh a, rângkachak milim kân ngîrtir khawm hi chibai in bûk nawh ti hi ân dik am a nih?"
"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?","tuhin tawtawrâwt dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm, rawsem dâm, perkhuong dâm, baza le rimawi tinrêng ri chu in hriet pha pha, in bawkkhupa milim ka siem chu chi- bai in bûk ding chun a ṭha; ami- ruokchu, chibai in bûk naw chun, chu dârkâr sûng ngeia chun meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun peiin um in tih; ka kuta inthawka sansuok ding cheu pathien chu tu am a ni leh?” a ta."
"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.","Sadrak, Mesak le, Abednego chun an dawn a, lal kuoma chun, “Aw Nebukadnezzar, hi thil chungchâng thua hin kan dawn che a ṭûl nawh."
"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.","Chuong chu a ni ding chun, kan Pathien a rawng kan ibâwl chun meithuk chawklai râpthlâka inthawk chun a mi sanhim thei a; aw lalpa, i kuta inthawk khawmin a mi sanhim thei a nih."
"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.","Chuong chu ni naw ding khawm ni sien, i pathienhai chu an rawng bâwl naw ning ung a, rângkachak milim în ngîrtir khawm chu chibai bûk naw bawk kan tih,” an ta."
"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chu lunginsennain a sip a, a hmêl umzie chu Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego chunga chun a hung danglam tah a; chuleiin, a hril a, meithuk chu a lum hlak ang let saria suklum dingin thu a pêk tah a."
"And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.","Chun, a sipai pâwl laia mi- hrâttakhai chu Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego chu khuop a, meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun pei lût dingin thu a pêk a."
"Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.","Chun, chuong mihai chu an kekawrhai, an lukâwmhai, an kawr- fuolhai le an silfên danghaia chun khuopa umin meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka peiin an um tah a."
"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.","Chuongchun, lal thupêk chu a nasa êm a, meithuk chu a lum kher lei chun meichawk chun Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego pei lûttuhai chu a sukhlum tah a."
"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.","Chun, chuong mi pathum, Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego chu khuop hlawm saa umin meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun an tla lût tah a."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.","Chun, lal Nebukadnezzar chun mak a ti ta hleh a, inhmawtakin a tho a, a rorêltuhai chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Mi pathum kha khuop sain mei lai ei pei lût a ni naw am a ni kha?” a ta. Anni chun an dawn a, lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, pei e,” an ta."
"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.","Ama chun a dawn a, “En ta u, mei laia khun mi pali sût sain inlawnin ka hmuh a, na hrim an ti nawh; a palina hmêl putzie chu pathienhai naupa ang a nih,” a ta."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chu mei- thuk chawklai râpthlâktak bula chun a hung hnai a, “Sadrak, Mesak, Abednego, nangni Pathien Chung- hnungtak siehlawhai, hung suok unla, hi tieng hin hung ro,” tiin a biek a. Chun, Sadrak, Mesak le,Abednego chu mei laia inthawk chun an hung suok tah a."
"And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.","Chun, biel awptuhai, ram awp- tuhai, sipai hotuhai le lal rorêltuhai hung inkhâwmhai chun chuong mihai chu an taksahai chunga chun meiin thilthawtheina a nei nawh a, an lua sam khawm chu a kângkin nawh a, an zakuohai khawm chu a danglam chuong nawh a, anni chu mei rim khawm an innam nawh ti chu an hmuh a."
"Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chun a hril a, “Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai Pathien, a vântirko hung tir a, a siehlaw ama ringtuhai hung san- himtu chu inpâkin um raw se; lal thuhai chu a hung sukdanglam a, an Pathien chau naw chu pathien dang hrim hrim chu a rawng an bâwla chibai an bûk nawna dingin an taksahai chu a humpêk tah a."
"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.","Chuleichun, thupêk ka siem, mi tin, hnam tin, le ṭawng tin, hieng Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai Pathien chunga thil hril suol taphawt chu, sât nawi vawng nîng an ta, an inhai khawm chu êk siekhâwmnaa siem nîng a tih; hieng ang kawnga mi sanhim thei pathien dang hrim an um naw leiin,” a ta."
"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.","Chun, Babulon biel sûnga chun lal chun Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai chu a siem lien tah a."
"Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.","Lal Nebukadnezzar chun, Mi po po, hnam po po, ṭawng tinhai le hnuoi chunga chêng taphawthai kuoma chun, in kuomah inremna hi sukpungin um raw se."
It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.,Pathien Chunghnungtakin ka kuomah inchiknahai le thilmakhai a thaw chu inentir hi ṭhain ka hriet a.
"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.","Ân chiknahai chu a va ropui ngei de!

"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.","Kei Nebukadnezzar hi ka ina chun inhawitakin ka um a, ka lal ina chun chênghnâwngtakin ka um a."
I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.,"Mang mi sukṭi êm êm el chu ka hmuh a, ka khum chunga ka ngai- tuonahai le, ka lua ka thil hmu- lâwknahai chun a mi suklungzîng êm êm a."
"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.","Chuleichun, mang umzie chu an mi hrilfie theina dingin Babulon rama mi var po pohai hung ṭhuoi khâwm dingin thupêk ka siem tah a."
"Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.","Chun, mitvaidawithiemhai, ai- sânthiemhai, Kaldai mihai le vâng- hriltuhai chu an hung lût a: chun, an hmaa chun mang chu ka hril a; nisienlakhawm, a umzie chu an mîn hriettir thei nawh a."
"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, saying,","Amiruokchu, a tâwp taka chun ka hmaa chun Daniel chu a hung lût a, a hming chu ka pathien hming ang peiin Beltesazzar a nih; amaa chun pathien inthienghai thlarau chu a um a; chuongchun, a hmaa chun mang chu ka hril tah a;"
"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.","“Aw Beltesazzar, mitvaidawi- thiemhai hotu, pathien inthienghai thlarau chu nangmaa chun a um a, thurûk chun nang a sukbuoi ngai naw che ti ka hriet leiin, ka manga thil hmulâwkhai ka hmu ta le, a umzie chu mi hril rawh."
"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.","Ka khum chunga ka lua thil hmulâwkhai ka hmu chu hieng ang hi a nih; hnuoi lailung lai hin thing ka hmuh a, ka en zing a, ân sângzie chu a nasa hleh a."
"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.","Thing chu a hung inṭhang a, a hung lien a, ân sângzie chun vân a hung phâk a, ân hmu theina chun khawvêl po po tâwp chen a huop bawk a."
"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.","A hnahai chu a mawiin a rahai chu a tam êm êm a, amaa chun mi po po ta dingin fâkding a um a; ramsahai chu a hnuoia chun an inzârhlieh a, chunglêng vatehai khawm chu a kâuhaia chun an chêng a, mi po po chu amaa châwmin an um a."
"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.","Ka khum chunga thil hmu- lâwkhai ka hmua chun, ngai ta, vâna inthawkin vêngtu le mi inthieng pakhat a hung thlah a."
"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.","Ama chu inringtakin a khêk a, ‘Thing kha phûr thlu unla, a kâuhai kha tan thla ro, a hnahai kha sâwi ṭil unla, a ra kha the dar bawk ro; a kâuhaia vatehai le, a hnuoia ram- sahai kha fe hmang raw hai seh."
"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:","Amiruokchu, a zunghai kûng- hmui kha chu rama hlobet innêm lai, thîr le dârsen hnânga khuopin hnuoia khan mâksan ro; chun, vâna inthawka daidaw chun sukhuin um sienla, a fâk chu ramsahai angin hnuoia hlobet ni sienla;"
"let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.","a lungril khawm chu mihriem lungrila inthawka sukdanglam ni sienla, a kuoma chun ramsahai lung- ril chu pêk ni raw se; chun, hun sarihai chu ama chungah bo raw se."
"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.","Hi thu sukthlûk hi vêngtuhai thupêk le, mi inthienghai thua phût: hringna nei taphawt chun Achung- hnungtak chun mihriemhai rama chun ro a rêl a, a nuomna kuoma chun a pêk a, mi inhnuoitakhai khawm a chunga chun a sie thei ti an hrietna dingin a nih,’ tiin."
"This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.","Hi mang hi kei Nebukadnezzar hin ka hmu tah a, Aw Beltesazzar, a umzie chu hrilfie rawh, ka ram sûnga mi varhai chun a umzie chu an mîn hriettir thei si nawh a: nisienla- khawm, nang chun i thei a nih; pathien inthienghai thlarau chu nangmaa chun a um sih a,” ka tih a."
"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.","Chun, Daniel a hming dang Beltesazzar chun chawmkhat tak chu mak a ti hleh a, a ngaituonahai chun ama a sukbuoi vieu a.

"And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;","Chun, lalin vâna inthawka vêngtu le mi inthieng hung thlaa, Thing kha phûr thlu unla sukbo- hmang ro, amiruokchu, a zunghai kûnghmui ruok chu hnuoia hlobet innêm lai thîr le dârsen hnânga khuopin mâksan ro, vâna inthawka daidâw chun hu hlak sienla, a fâk ding khawm chu ramhnuoia ramsa- hai fâk ang chu ni raw se; ama chunga hun sarihai a fe liem hma- khat chun, ti thu an hung hril ruok hi chu,"

At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.,Thla sâwm pahnihai tâwpa chun Babulon ram lal ina chun a feh a.

"While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:","Lalin chuonga thu a hril lai zing chun, vâna inthawkin râwl a hung thlah a, “Aw lal Nebukadnezzar, nangma kuoma inthawkin ram chu ṭhe hmang a ni tah ti hi i kuomah hril a nih."

"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.","Chu dâr ngeia chun chuong thil chu Nebukadnezzar chunga chun intlungtir a ni tah a, mihriem laia inthawka hnawt hmangin a um a, bâwngchal angin hlobet a pet a, a taksa chu vâna inthawka dâidâw chun a sukhuh a, a samhai chu mupui hmul ang el a hung nih a, a tinhai chu vatehai tin ang a hung ni chen chun."
"And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation;","Chuong nihai tâwpa chun, kei Nebukadnezzar hin ka mithai chu vântieng ka tang a, ka hrietna chu ka kuomah a hung kîr nâwk a, Achung- hnungtak chu mal ka sâwm a, cha- tuona hring zing chu ka chawimawiin kân pâk a: A rorêlna chu chatuon rorêl a na, A lalram chu ṭhanga inthawk ṭhang sâwng tamtak chen a ni sih a;"

"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.","Chu chu huna chun ka hriet- thiemna chu ka kuomah a hung kîr nâwk a; ka ram ropuina le ka înlalna le êngna chu ka kuomah an hung kîr nâwk sih a; chun, ka upahai le ka lalhai chun an mi zawng a; ka rama chun tungdingin ka um a, ropuina nasatak el chu ka kuomah belsain a um tah a."

"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.","Lal Belsazzar chun a lalhai sâng khat ta dingin ruoi ropuitak a ṭheh a, sâng khat hmaa chun uoin a dâwn tah a."
"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.","Belsazzar chun uoin chu a hang dâwn chun, lal le a lalhai le a nu- hmeihai le, a thaikêmhai chun an dâwnna dingin, a pa Nebukadnezzar- in Jerusalem Templea inthawka a lâk, rângkachak le tangkaruo bûr le bêlhai chu hung la dingin thu a pêk tah a."
"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien in Templea rângkachak bûr le bêl an lâk tahai chu an hung lâk tah a; lal le a lalhai le, a nuhmeihai le a thaikêm- hai chun chuonga chun uoin an dâwn tah a."
"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.","Uoin chu an hang dâwn a, râng- kachak dâm, tangka dâm, dârsen dâm, thîr dâm, thing dâm, lung dâm pathienhai chu an inpâk tah a."
"In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.","chun, chu dâr ma chun mihriem kut kutpârhai a hung suok a, lal in bang nâl vâr chunga chun sathâu khâwnvar sana chun a ziek tah a; chun, lal chun chu kut bawng, chu hung ziektu chu a hmuh a."
"Then the king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.","Chun, lal hmêlput dân chu a hung danglam a, a ngaituonahai chun ama a sukbuoi tah a; a kâwngru insuktuoknahai chu a hung inthâwt a, a khûp le khûp chu an invuoktuo tah a."
"The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Chun, aisânthiemhai, Kaldai mi- hai le vânghriltuhai chu hung ṭhuoi dingin lal chu inringtakin a khêk tah a.

"Then came in all the king’s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.","Chun, lal mi varhai po po chu an hung lût a; nisienlakhawm, lekhaziek chu an tiem thei nawh a, a umzie khawm chu lal chu an inhriettir thei nawh a."
"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.","Chuongchun, lal Belsazzar chu nasatakin a lunginzîng tah a, a hmêl chu a hung danglam a, a lalhai khawm chu an lunginzîng nasa hleh a."
"Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.","Chuongchun, lal le a lalhai thuhai lei chun ruoiṭhena ina chun lalnu chu a hung lût a, lalnu chun a hril a, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh, i ngaituonahai chun sukbuoi naw sienla che, i hmêlput dân khawm danglam bawk naw raw se."
"There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;","I rama hin mi pakhat amaa pathien inthienghai thlarau umna chu a um a; i pa damlai khawm êngna dâm, hrietthiemna dâm, pathienhai varna anga varna dâm amaa chun hmu suokin a um tah a: aw lalpa, i pa Nebukadnezzar, i pa chun ama chu mitvaidawithiemhai, aisânthiemhai, Kaldai mihai le vânghriltuhai hotuah a siem a,"
"forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.","lalin Beltesazzar ân bûk Daniela chun, thu ringhla umhai sukfelin, thu khirtakhai a umzie inentirin le manghai hrilfiein, amaa chun hrietna dâm, thiemna dâm le lungril ṭha bîk chu hmu suokin a um a.

"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?","Chun, lal hmaa chun Daniel chu an hung ṭhuoi lût a, lal chun Daniel kuomah, “Ka pa lalin Juda rama inthawka a hung ṭhuoi, Juda mi sal intânghai laia mi, Daniel chu i ni maw?"

"And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.","Tuhin, hi lekhaziek hi an tiema a umzie an mîn hriettir theina dingin mi varhai le aisânthiemhai chu ka hmaah ṭhuoi lûtin an um a; ni- sienlakhawm, thil umzie chu an inentir thei nawh a."
"But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Amiruokchu, a umziehai chu i hril theiin, thu ringhlaumhai khawm chu i sukfel thei tiin i chanchin hi ka lo hriet a; tuhin, lekhaziek hi i tiem thei a, a umzie chu i mîn hriettir thei chun puon senduk insiltir nîng i ta, i rîngah rângkachak khaidiet inhlitir ni bawk i ta, hi rama hin rorêltu pathumna chu nîng i tih,” a ta."
"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.","Daniel chun a dawn a, lal hmaa chun, “I thilpêkhai chu nangma ta ni lem sienla, i lâwmmanhai chu mi dang kuomah pe lem rawh, amiruok- chu, lekhaziek chu lal kuoma chun tiem ka ta, a umzie chu inhriettir ka tih."
"O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:","Aw nang lalpa, Achunghnung- tak Pathien chun i pa Nebukadnezzar chu ram dâm, ropuina dâm, nasatna dâm, inlalna dâm a pêk a;"
"and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.","ropuina a pêk lei chun a hmaa chun mi po pohai, hnam po pohai le ṭawng tinhai chu an inthinin an ṭih a; a nuom nuom a that a, a nuom nuom chu a sukhring bawk a; a nuom nuom chu a kei sâng a, a nuom nuom chu a kei hnuoi bawk a."
"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:","Nisienlakhawm, a lungril chu a hung insâng a, a lungril a hung ngar phingle chun chapotakin a thaw tah a, ân lalna lalṭhungphaa inthawk chun sie hnuoiin a um tah a, amaa inthawk chun a ropuina chu an lâk hmang a,"
"and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts’, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.","chun, mihriem nauhai laia inthawk chun hnawt hmangin a um a; a lungril chu ramsahai lungril anga siem a hung na; a umna hmun chu ram sabengtunghai lai a ni tah a; chun, bâwngchal angin hlobet chu a ring a, a taksa chu vâna inthawka daidawin a sukhu ta bawk a: mi- hriemhai ram chunga hin Pathien Chunghnungtakin ro a rêl a, a nuom nuom chu a chunga chun a sie hlak ti a hriet hmakhat chun."

"but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.","Vâna Lalpa chu kalin nang le nang în chawisâng ta lem a; a ina bûrlebêlhai chu i hmaa chun an hung lâk a, nang le i lalhai le i nuhmeihai le i thaikêmhai chun chuonga chun uoin in dâwn tah a; chun, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, dârsen dâm, thîr dâm, thing dâm, lung dâm pathien- hai, hmu thei lo le, hre thei lo le, hrietna neilohai chu in inpâk a; Pathien a kuta i hringna umna le ama i lampui po po umna chu i chawi- mawi nawh a,"
"Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.","ama hmaa inthawk chun hi kut bawng hi hungtir a ni tah a, hi lekhaziek hi a hung ziek tah a nih."
"And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.","Chun, hi hi lekhaziek hung in- ziek chu a nih: MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN."
"This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end.","Chu thil umzie chu hi hi a nih: MENE chu ‘Pathien chun i ram chu a tiem zo tah a, a tâwp chu ân tlun tah a nih,’ tina a na."
"TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.","TEKEL chu ‘Bûknahaia chun bûkin i um a, tling loa hmu i nih,’ tina a nih."
"PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.","PERES chu ‘I ram chu ṭhe a ni tah a, Media le Persia mihai kuom- a chun pêk a ni tah,’ tina a nih,” tiin."
"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Chun, Belsazzar chun thu a pêk a, Daniel chu puon senduk an insiltir a, a rînga chun rângkachak khaidiet an inhlitir a; chun, ama chungthua chun ram sûnga rorêltu pathumna chu a ni ding a nih ti thuphuong a siem tah a."
In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.,Chu zân chun Kaldai lal Belsazzar chu thatin a um tah a.
"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.","Chun, Media mi Daria chun ram chu a nei tah a, ama chu kum sâwmruk pahnia upa a nih."
"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;","Daria chun, ram sûng po poa chun biel awptu za sâwmhni sie ding ti le"
"and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.","an chunga chun hotu pathum, a pakhat chu Daniel chu ni dingin ti chu ṭha a ti a; chun, hieng biel awp- tuhai hin anni kuoma chun sum sêng dân chanchin chu pêng an ta; chuong- chun, lal chun sietna a tuok nawna dingin."
"Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.","Chun, hi Daniel hi amaa chun lungvar ṭha bîk a um leiin biel awp- tuhai le an hotuhai nêk chun a danglam bîk rieu a; chuongchun, lal chun a ram po po chunga hotua siem a lungril a."
"Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.","Chun, hotuhai le biel awptuhai chun ram chungthuah Daniel chunga chun remchâng an zawng tah a; ni- sienlakhawm, ama chu ring a um a, amaa chun khawhlona le indiknawna hrim hmu a ni naw leiin khawhlona le remchâng chu an hmu thei dêr nawh a."
"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.","Chun, chuong mihai chun, “A Pathien dân chung thuah ama kalna ei hmu ti ngawt naw chu, Daniel chunga hin remchâng ei hmu thei ngai âwm nawh,” an ta."
"Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.","Chun, hieng hotuhai le biel awptuhai hi lal kuoma chun an hung inkhâwm a, a kuomah, “Lal Daria, kumkhuoin dam rawh."
"All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.","Hi rama hotuhai, ram awptuhai, biel awptuhai, sipai hotuhai le rorêl- tuhai po po kan inkhâwm a, aw lalpa, ni sâwmthum sûng chu nangma kuoma chau naw chu tukhawmin mi dang amanih, pathien amani kuoma hnina a siem hrim hrim chu, ama chu sakeibakneihai pûka pei lût ni raw se tia dân dettak siem dingin kan inbiekthlûk tah a nih."
"Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.","Tuhin, aw lalpa, chu dân chu sukdet la, Media le Persia mihai dâna sukdanglam a ni nâwk nawna dingin i hming ziek rawh,” an ta."
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.,"Chuongchun, lal Daria chun chu lekhaziek le thupêka chun a hming a ziek tah a."
"And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem); and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.","Daniel chun chu lekhazieka chun hming ziek a ni tah ti a hriet phingleh a inah a fe tah a; (a pindana a tukverhai chu Jerusalem khuo tienga hawng zing a na) chun, a khûpin ni khatah vawi thum pei a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a Pathien hmaa chun, a hmaa a lo thaw rawp ta angin a ṭawngṭai a, lâwmthu a hril tah a."
"Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.","Chun, chuong mihai chu an inkhâwm a, Daniel chu a Pathien hmaa hnina siema ṭawngṭaiin an hmu tah a."
"Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.","Chun, an hung hnai a, lal hmaa chun lal thupêk chungchang thu chu an hril tah a; “Aw lalpa, nangma kuomah ti chau lo chu, ni sâwmthum sûng mi tukhawmin mi dang amani, pathien kuoma mani hnina siem chu sakeibakneihai pûka pei lût ding ti thupêka khan i hming i ziek an nâwm a nih?” an ta. Lal chun a dawn a, “Media mihai le Persia mihai dân sukdanglam thieng lo ang tak chun chu chu ân dik a nih,” a ta."
"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.","Chun, an dawn a, lal kuoma chun, “Kha Daniel Juda ram mi salintângpa khan, aw lalpa, nang a pawisa naw cheh a, i thupêk i hming ziek khawm kha a pawisa nawh a, ni tin hnina vawi thum a siem zie a nih,” an ta."
"Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.","Chun, lal chun hieng thu hi a hriet phingleh nasatakin a lungni ta nawh a, ama sansuok dingin Daniel chunga chun a lungril chu a fu ta tlat a; ama sansuok ding chun nisa tlâk hmakhat chun nasatakin ân ngai- tuoh a."
"Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.","Chun, chuong mihai chu lal kuomah an hung inkhâwm a, lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, thupêk amanih, dân amanih lalin a siem ta chu sukdanglam thieng lo a nih ti hi Media le Persia mihai dân a nih ti hi hre rawh,” an ta."
"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.","Chun, lal chun thu a pêk a, Daniel chu an hung ṭhuoi a, sakei- bakneihai pûka chun an pei lût tah a. Lal chun a hril a, Daniel kuoma chun, “I Pathien a rawng i bâwl zing hlak chun sansuok a ti che,” a ta."
"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.","Chun, lung chu an hung lâk a, a pûk baua chun an indel tah a; chuongchun, lal chun ama hming namna le a rorêltuhai hming namna chu Daniel chungchâng thua chun thil sukdanglam hrim hrim um lo dingin a nam tah a."
"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.","Chun, lal chu a lal ina chun a feh a, chu zân chu bungheiin a hmang zo tah a; a hmaa chun thil rimawihai hung lâkin a um ta nawh a, a imu chu amaa inthawkin a zâm hmang tah a."
"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.","Chun, lal chu zîngkâr inhma- takin a tho a, sakeibakneihai pûka chun inhmatakin a va fe tah a."
"And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?","Daniel kuomah, sakeibakneihai pûk kâwl chu a hung tlung hnai chun, ṭap râwlin a khêk a; lal chun Daniel kuoma chun, “Aw Daniel, Pathien hring siehlawpa, i Pathien a rawng i bâwl zing zing hlak chun sakeibak- neihaia inthawkin a sansuok thei che am a nih?” a ta."
"Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.","Daniel chun lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh."
"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.","Ka Pathien chun a vântirko a hungtir a, sakeibakneihai bau chu a hung sukchîp a, an mi sukna hrim hrim nawh; a hmaa chun keimaa indik nawna um lo chu hmuin a um a; aw lalpa nanga hmaa khawm ieng- khawm ka sukpawi nawh,” a ta."
"Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.","Chun, lal chu nasatakin a lâwm tah a, Daniel chu pûka inthawka la suok ding chun anni chu thu a pêk tah a, chuongchun, Daniel chu pûka inthawk chu lâk suokin a um a, ama chun Pathien chu a ring tlat leiin amaa chun suknatna iengkhawm hmuin a um nawh a."
"And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.","Chun, lal chun thu a pêk a, chuong Daniel hêktuhai chu an hung ṭhuoi a; anni leh, an nauhai leh, an nuhmeihai le chun sakei- bakneihai pûka chun an pei tah a; anni chu sakeibakneihai chun an lo thaw tah a, an ruhai chu a nawi nawiin an suktliek vawng a, pûk ṭuong chu an tlung hman naw hiel lem a nih."
"Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.","Chun, lal Daria chun hnuoi chung po poa chêng mi po po le ṭawng tinrênghai kuoma chun lekha a ziek tah a, “In kuomah inremna sukpung- in um raw se."
"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.","Thupêk chu ka siem a; ka ram leilunga mi po pohai chun Daniel Pathien chu ṭiin a hmaa chun inthin raw hai se.

"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.","Ama chun a sansuokin a sanhim a, Hnuoi le vâna khawm thilmakhai le inchiknahai a thawh a, Ama chu sakeibakneihai thilthawtheinaa inthawka Daniel sanhimtu chu a nih,” tiin."
"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.","Chuongchun, Daniel chu Daria rorêl sûng le Persia mi Kura rorêl sûng po chu a hung hlawtling ta hleh a."
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.,"Babulon lal Belsazzar inlal kum khatnaa chun Daniel chun mang neiin a khum chunga chun a lua thil hmulâwkhai chu a hmu tah a; chun, mang chu a ziek a, chuong thilhai umzie chu a hril bawk a."
"Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.","Daniel chun a hril a, “Zâna hin ka thil hmulâwkna chun, ngai ta, vân thli hai pali chu tuisuoriet ropui- tak chunga an lo hrâng hi ka hmuh a."
"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.","Tuisuorieta inthawk chun sa- hrâng pali, danglam seng hi an hung suok a."
"The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.","A hmasatak chu sakeibaknei ang a na, mupui thlahai a nei a; a thlahai chu sukthlawnga uma, hnuoia in- thawka dawm kânga uma, mihriem anga ke pahnia inngîrtir a hung na, mihriem lungril a kuoma pêk a ni chen chun ka en zing a."
"And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.","Chun, ngai ta, sahrâng dang, a pahnina chu, savawm ang, a sîr khat tienga indawm kâng a na, a baua a hahai kâra chun nâkru pathum a um a; chun a kuoma chun, ‘Tho la, tisa tamtak fa zo vawng rawh,’ an ta."
"After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.","Hi hnunga hin, ngai ta, a dang keitê ang, a ruongzânga vate thlahai ang thla pali nei chu ka hmuh a; chu sahrâng chun lu pali khawm a nei bawk a, a kuoma chun rorêlna chu pêk a ni tah a."
"After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.","Hi hnunga hin zâna thil hmu- lâwkhai chu ka hmuh a, sahrâng palina chu, ngai ta, hrât êm êm el, thilthawtheitak, ṭiumtak el hi a na; thîr ha ropuitakhai chu a nei a; a fâk zo a, a suknâwiin a suknâwi a, a mahlahai chu a kehaiin a sirdeh a, a hmaa sahrânghai po poa inthawk khan danglamtak a na; chun, ki sâwm a nei bawk a."
"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.","Kihai chu ka ngaituoh a; chun, ngai ta, anni lai chun ki dang, ki chitê hi a hung suok a, chu hmaa chun ki hmasa pathumhai kha an zung chena phawi dawkin an um tah a; chun, ngai ta, chu kia chun mihriem mithai ang mithai le, bau thil ropuitaka ṭawngsuok chu a um bawk a."
"I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.","Ka en zing a.

"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.","Chun, tuihnâr ṭiumtak a hung suok a, A hma bula inthawk chun a hung suok a, Sâng sânga sângin a rawng an bâwl a, Sang sâwm sâwma vawi sâng sâwm a hmaa chun an ngîr a; Rorêlna chu ṭan a ni tah a, Lekhabuhai chu hawngin a um tah a."
"I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.","“Chu kiin thu ropuitakhai a hrilna râwlri lei chun chu lai chun ka en zing a; sahrâng chu thatin a um a, a taksa chu suksietin a um a, meia raw dinga pêka a um chen chun ka en zing a."
"And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.","Chun, sahrâng danghai ruok kha chu, an ram chu lâkpêk an ni tah a; nisienlakhawm, an hringnahai ruok chu hunbi khat le hun khat chenin suksei a nih."
"I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.","Zâna thil hmulâwkhai ka hmuh a, chun, ngai ta, Mi pakhat mihriem naupa ni âwm tak vân sûmhai le um a hung a, Tienlai mi kuoma ngei chun a hung a, Ama hmaa chun an hung ṭhuoi a."
"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.","Chun, ama chu mi po po le hnam po po le ṭawng tinrêngin, A rawng an bâwl theina dingin a kuoma chun Rorêlna dâm, ropuina dâm, lalram dâm an pêk a, A lalram chu chatuon lalram bo ta ngailo ding le, A ram suksieta um ta ngailo ding chu a nih."
"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.","“Kei Daniel ruok chu, ka taksa sûnga chun ka lungril chu suknatin a um a, ka lua thil hmulâwkna chun a mi suklungzîng hleh a."
"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.","Ka kâwla ngîrhai laia pakhat kuom chu ka hung hnai a, hi po po chungthua thudik chu kân dawn tah a. Chuongchun, ama chun a mi hril a, thil umziehai chu a mîn hriettir tah a."
"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.","‘Hieng sahrâng pali hi, lal pali hnuoi chunga la hung suok dinghai chu an nih."
"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.","Nisienlakhawm, Achunghnung- tak mi inthienghai chun ram chu chang an ta, chatuon, chatuon chenin ram chu nei an tih,’ tiin."
"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;","“Chun, sahrâng palina, a dang- hai nêka danglam bîk, ṭiumtak, a hahai thîr nia, a tinhai chu dârsen nia, fa zo vawng a, a suknâwia suk- nâwi a, a mahla chu a kehaia sirdetu chungthua thudik chu hriet ka nuom tah a,"
"and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.","chun, a lua ki sâwmhai le, ki dang hung suoka, a hmaa pathum- hai chu thlawnga uma, chu ki ngei chun mithai a nei le, bau thil ropuitakhai ṭawngsuokna le, a hmêlputzie a ruolhai nêka ropui lem tak chungthu chu hriet ka nuom a."
"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;","Ka en zing a, chu ki chun mi inthienghai le chun indona a siem a, anni chu a hne tah a."
"until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.","Tienlai mi chu a hung a, Achunghnungtak mi inthienghai chu rorêlna chu a pêk a, mi inthienghaiin ram chu an chang hun a tlung hmakhat chun."
"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.","Chun, ama chun a hril a, ‘Sahrâng palina chu hnuoi chunga ram palina, ram dang po poa in- thawka danglam tak ding, hnuoi po po chu lem zo a, sirde a, a suknâwia suknâwitu ding chu a nih."
"And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.","Chun, ki sâwm chungthua chu: hi rama inthawk hin lal sâwm hung suok an ta, anni hnungah pakhat dang suok pei a ta; a hmaahai nêk chun danglam a ta, lal pathum chu suktlâwm a tih."
"And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.","Achunghnungtak chu kalin thu hril a ta, Achunghnungtak mi in- thienghai chu hung suksieng a tih: chun, hunhai le dân chu sukdanglam dingin ngaituong a ta, hun khat le hunhai le hun chenve sûng chu a kuta pêk nîng an tih."
"But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.","Nisienlakhawm, rorêlna chu um a ta, a tâwp chena suksiet a, sukbohmang dingin a ram chu lâkpêk an tih."
"And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.","Chun, vânhnuoia ram le lalram le ram ropuinahai chu Achunghnung- tak mi inthienghai hnam kuoma chun pêk nîng a ta, ama ram chu chatuon ram a na, ram po pohai chun a rawng bâwl an ta, ama thu awi an tih,’ tiin."
"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.","“Hi hi thu tâwpna chu a nih a; kei Daniel ta ding chun ka ngai- tuonahai chun a mi sukbuoi hleh a, ka hmêlputziehai chu a hung dang- lam a; nisienlakhawm, chu thil chu ka lungrilah ka vawng zing a,” tiin."
"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.","Lal Belsazzar rorêl a kum thum- naa chun thil hmulâwkhai, a hmaa ka kuoma hung inlang hnunga khan, ka kuomah, kei Daniel kuoma ngei a hung inlang a."
"And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.","Chun, thil hmulâwka chun ka hmuh a; Hieng ang hi a lo nih a, thilhmulâwk ka hmu lai chun, Elam rama lal in, Susaa chun ka lo um a; thil hmulâwka chun ka hmuh a; Ulai vadung kâwlah ka lo um a."
"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.","Chun, ka mit ka hang meng a, ngai ta, vadung kâwla chun berâmchal ki pahni nei a ngîr ka hmuh a; chu kihai pahni chu ân sâng hleh a; ami- ruokchu, a ki pakhat chu a dang nêk chun ân sâng lem a; ân sâng lem chu a hung suok nuhnung lem chu a na."
"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.","Berâmchal chu thlangtieng le, hmârtieng le, simtieng chu panin ka hmuh a; a hmaa hrim hrim chun ramsa dang ngîr thei an um nawh a, a kuta inthawka la dawk thei hrim hrim khawm tukhawm an um nawh a; chuongchun, a nuom ang angin a thawh a, ama le ama chu ân chawi- mawi tah a."
"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.","Chun, ka ngaituo lai chun, ngai ta, hnuoi chung po po dâpin thlang- tienga inthawkin kêlchal a hung a, hnuoi hrim hrim a tâwk nawh a; chun, kêl chun a mithai inkâra chun ki maktak el a nei a."
"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.","Chun, berâmchal ki pahni nei, vadung kâwla ngîr ka hmu kuoma chun a hung a; chuongchun, a theipa- tâwpin ama chu a baw tah a."
"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.","Chun, berâmchal hnaia hung chu ka hmuh a, a chunga chun lung- insentakin a châng a; berâmchal chu a sik a, a kihai pahni chu a suktliek tah a; ama hmaa ngîr dingin berâm- chala chun thilthawtheina hrim a um nawh a; chuleiin, hnuoi chungah a tethlûk a, ama chu sirdein a chîl a; chuongchun, ama kuta inthawka berâmchal sansuok thei hrim hrim chu an um nawh a."
"And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.","Chun, kêlchal chu ama le ama nasatakin ân chawimawi a, a hrât hle lai chun a ki ropuitak chu a tliek tah a; a aia chun vân thli palihai tienga chun ki maktak pali a hung suok a."
"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.","Anni laia pakhata inthawk chun ki chitê a hung suok a, chu chu sim- tieng le, saktieng le ram ropui tieng chun ropuitakin a hung um tah a."
"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.","Chun, vân mipuihai laia khawm chun a hung ropui hleh a; chuong- chun, pâwl ṭhenkhat le arasi ṭhen- khat chu hnuoiah a pei thlâk a, anni a sirde tah a."
"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual burnt-offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.","Anih, mipuihai lal kuoma ngei khawm chun ama le ama chu ân chawimawi a; pumrawhmanga in- thawina zing zinghai chu amaa inthawkin a lâk hmang a; a Hmun Inthiengtak chu a pei thlâkpêk a."
"And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.","Chun, bawsietna leia pumraw- hmanga inthâwina inhlân zing zingna le chun mipuihai chu a kuoma pêk a ni tah a. Thudik chu hnuoiah a peithlâk a, a nuom nuom a thawh a, a hlawtling bawk a."
"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?","Chun, mi inthieng pakhat thu- hril ka hriet a; chun, mi inthieng dangin tu amanih thuhriltu kuoma chun, “Mipuihai le Hmun Inthieng- tak sirdea um ve ve dinga pêk ding le, sukrêmtu bawsietna le, pumraw- hmang thilinhlân zing zing chung- thua thil hmulâwk hi ieng chen am nîng a ta?” a ta."
"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Zân- tienghai le zîngtienghai sâng hni za thum chen nîng a tih; chun, Hmun Inthiengtak chu sukthieng nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.","Chun, kei Daniel ngei hin, hre dinga ka izawng thilhmulâwk chu ka hmu tah a; chun, ngai ta, ka hmaa chun mihriem hmêlput hi a hung ngîr a."
"And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.","Chun, mihriem râwl hi Ulai vapanghai inkâra chun ka hriet a, chu râwl chu a khêk a, “Gabriel, hi mipa hi thil hmulâwk kha inhriettir rawh,” a ta."
"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.","Chuongchun, ka ngîrna hmun kâwla chun a hung hnai a; chun, a hung hnai chun ka ṭih a, ka bawk- khup tah a; nisienlakhawm, ka kuoma chun, “Aw mihriem naupa, thil hmulâwkhai chu hun tâwpa ding a nih ti hi hre rawh,” a ta."
"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.","Ka kuoma thu a hril lai chun ka hmai chu hnuoi tieng innghatin in- hniktakin ka in a; nisienlakhawm, a mi them a, a mîn tungtho tah a."
"And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.","Ama chun, “Ngai ta, lunginsen- na hun tâwp tieng hun nuhnunga thil um ding chu inhriettir ka ti che, a tâwpna hunbi ruota ṭhang ding chu a ni sih a."
"The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.",Berâmchal ki pahni nei i hmu kha Media le Persia lalhai an na.
And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.,"Kêlchal nunsetak kha Grik ram lal a nih; chun, a mithai kâra ki ropuitak kha lal hmasatak chu a nih."
"And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.","Chun, a tliek a, a hmuna pali hung suok kha, chu hnama inthawk chun lal pali hung ngîrsuok an ta; nisienlakhawm, a thilthawtheina le chu ni naw ni."
"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.","Chun, an ram hun nuhnung tienga, bawsetuhai an hung puitling pha chun lal hmêl ṭiumtak, thu khir- tak takhai hre thei hung ngîrsuok a ta."
"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.","A thilthawtheina chu hrâttak nîng a ta, nisienlakhawm, ama thil- thawtheina hran ngat chu ni naw ni; râpthlâktakin suksieng a ta, hlaw- tling a ta, a nuom nuom thaw bawk a tih; mi inthienghai le mi hrâttakhai chu sukse bawk a tih."
"And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.","A remruot dân hmangin a kuta chun vervêkna chu inhlawtlingtir a ta; a lungrila chun ama le ama chu inchawimawi a tih; chun, an inring naw kârin mi tamtak chu suksieng a ta, lalhai lal chungah ngîrsuok bawk a ta, nisienlakhawm, kut loa suksiet nîng a tih."
And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.,"Chun, zântienghai le zîngtieng- hai thilhmulâwka thil hril chu ân dik a nih; nisienlakhawm, thil hmulâwk chu la khâr hri phawt rawh; ni la hung tlung ding tamtakhai ta ding chu a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.","Chun, kei Daniel chu ka châu a, ni iengzât amani chu ka damnawh a; chun, ka tho a, lal sin chu ka thaw tah a: nisienlakhawm, thilhmulâwka chun mak ka ti êm êm a, tukhawma an hriet thiem si nawh a."
"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,","Kaldai mihai rama lala siema um, Media chi Ahasuera naupa Daria kum khat kum;"
"in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.","a rorêl kum khat kuma chun kei Daniel hin kum sâwmsaria Jerusa- lem khuo suksieta a um ding hun tlungkimna ding, zâwlnei Jeremia kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung, kum- hai nizât chu lekhabuhaia inthawkin ka lo hriet tah a."
"And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.","Chun, vut laia saiip puon le in- ṭhunga bungheiin, hnina le ṭawng- ṭainaa zawng dingin LALPA Pathien kuom tieng chu ka ngha tah a."
"And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,","LALPA ka Pathien kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai a, thuphachawina dâm ka siem a, “Aw LALPA, i thupêkhai kawltu le, nangma hmangaituhai kuoma zângaina le thuthlung kawltu Pathien ṭiumtak le ropui;"

"O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.","Aw LALPA, felna chu nangma ta a na; nisienlakhawm, vawisûn ni ang bawk hin, hmêl hamhaitak chu kan nei lem a; Juda mihai le, Jerusalem hluotuhai le, Israel rama mi po po khawm, i chunga an lo bawsiet ta leia an bawsietna leia anni i lo hnawt suokna ram po po, ram hla le ram hnaia umhai khawm chu angkhat vawng kan nih."

"Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.","Anih, Israel mihai po po chun i râwl chu awi lo dinga inherhmangin i Dân chu an lo bawsiet tah a; chuleiin, ṭawngsie chu kan chungah, Pathien siehlaw Mosie dâna inkhâmna zieka um le chun buokin a um tah a; chuonga chun thil kan lo suksuol ta sih a."
"And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.","Kan chungah thil ṭha naw chu intlungtirin, keini le kan rorêltuhai, kan chunga rorêltuhai chungah a thu a hrilhai chu a hung sukdet tah a; Jerusalem khaw chunga thaw a ni ta ang hin vân hnuoi po po khâwlai khawm thaw a ni ngai si nawh a."
"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.","Mosie Dâna ziek a ni angin hieng thil ṭha naw po po hi kan chungah a hung tlung a nih; chuong khawm chun, i thudik chu chîktaka ngaituona nei ding le kan rîtlonahaia inthawka inher hmang dingin LALPA kan Pathien ditsakna chu kan hni chuong nawh a."
"Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun thil ṭha naw chu a hmu zing a, kan chungah a hung intlungtir tah a nih; LALPA kan Pathien chu a sinthaw a thawhai po poa chun a fel a nih, keini ruok chun a râwl chu kan awi nawh a."
"And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.","Tuhin, aw LALPA kan Pathien, Aigupta rama inthawka i mihai kut hrâttak le hung ṭhuoi suoka, vawisûn ni anga hming inthangna changtu, kan lo suksuol tah a, rilotakin kan lo thaw tah a nih."
"O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us.","Aw LALPA, i felna ang peiin i lunginsenna le i ṭiumna chu i tlâng inthieng, Jerusalem i khuoa inthawk chun, ka hni che hi, herhmang ni raw se.

"Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.","Hapta sâwm sarihai chu i mihai le khaw inthieng ta dinga bawsiet- nahai insûmna ding le suolnahai bân- sanna ding le, khawhlona ta dinga inremna siema, kumkhuoa felna chu insuona ding le, thilhmulâwk le hrillâwkna chu khârkhumna ding le, Hmun Inthiengtak chu hriek nâlna hun dinga pêk a nih."
"Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.","Chuleiin, hre la, hrethiem rawh, Jerusalem khuo bâwl ding le siem thar dinga thupêk hung suoka inthawk Messie, Lal Naupa chen chu hapta sari le, hapta sâwmruk pahni nîng a ta, a kawtthlêr le a banghai chu siem nîng a tih, hun buoithlâk- taka khawm chun."
"And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined.","Chun, hapta sâwmruk pahni hnunga chun Messie chu sât thlâk nîng a ta, ama ta dingin ni loin, chun, lal mihai hung dinghai chun khawpui le Hmun Inthiengtak chu suksieng an ta, a tâwpna chu tuilêt nîng a ta, a tâwpa chun indona nîng a tih; suk- rêma umna ding chu ruot a ni ta sih a."
"And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall wrath be poured out upon the desolate.","Chun, hapta khat chu mi tam- tak leh thuthlung dettak siem a ta, chun, chu hapta chenve kâr chun inthâwina le thilinhlân chu suktâwp a tih; chun, tirdakumna thla chunga chun sukrêmtu inumtirtu ding chu hung a ta, a tâwpna ding ruot chen chun; chun, sukrêmtu chunga chun lunginsenna chu buok ni tâng a tih,” tiin."
