The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.,Malaki hmanga Israel chunga LALPA thu phurrik chu.
"I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob;","LALPA chun, “Ka hmangai cheu a, nangni ruok chun, ‘Khaw lai am i mi hmangai a?’ in la ti rawp a,” a ta. LALPA chun, “Esau chu Jakob u- naupa a ni naw am a nih? Jakob chu ka hmangai a,"
"but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.","Esau ruok chu ka theida a, tlânghai chu râusanin ka siem a, a rochan chu thlalêr sihalhai kuomah ka pêk kha,” a ta."
"Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.","Edom mihai chun, “Hnein ei um ta ngeia chu, kîr nâwk ei ta, hmun se tahai chu siem ṭhâng ei tih,” ti hai sien khawm; sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Bâwl an ta chu, kei thlûng ka tih: chun, mihai chun anni chu, ‘Khawhlona ram le, kumkhuoa an chunga LALPA lunginsenna zing zing hnam,’ tîng an tih."
"And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.","In mithaiin hmûng in ta, ‘Israel ram khêl chena khawm LALPA chu chawimawiin a um tah a ni hi,’ tîng in tih,” tiin."
"A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?","Sipaihai LALPA chun in kuomah a hril a, “Aw thiempu, ka hming hmusittuhai, naupa chun a pa ân zah a, siehlaw chun a hotu: chuonga pa ka ni chun, khâw lai am inza ka nina? Hotu ka ni chun, khâwlai am ṭi ka nina? Nangni chun, ‘Khâwlai am i hming chu kan hmusit a?’ in tih a."
"Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.","Ka dawkân chunga khan bei sukpawrche tah in inhlân a; chun, nangni chun, ‘Khâwlai am kan sukpawrche cheh a?’ in tih a. Chutaka chun, ‘LALPA dawkân chu hmusitum a nih,’ in ti kha."
"And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.","Inthâwina dinga a mitdel in inhlân khan, suol a ni naw bâk chu teh! A damnaw le a kebai in inhlân khan, suol a ni naw bâk chu teh! In rorêltu kuomah va pe hrim ta u, a lo lâwm hrim cheu am? Annawleh, in mi nina chu a lo pawm ding am a nih? sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chuongchun, tuhin, ka ngên cheu hi, ei kuoma za a ngai theina dingin LALPA ditsakna chu ngên ro; hi hi nangni kut thilthaw ngei chu a na, nangni mi nina chu a pawmpêk ding cheu am a nih? sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.","Nangni laia mi pakhat bêk, ka mâichâma a thlâwna mei a sêm nawna dinga kawtkhârhai khâr hlak chu um unla chu aw! sipaihai LALPA chun a tih, nangnia hin lâwmna hrim ka nei naw a nih; in kuta thilin- hlân hrim hrim khawm lâwm naw ningah."
"For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Nisa suoknaa inthawka a tlâk- na chenin Jentailhai lai hman ka hming hi a ropui a na; hmun tinahai chun riminhnik dâm ka hminga in- hlân a na, thil inthieng inhlân leh; Jentailhai lai hman ka hming chu a ropui sih a, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.","Amiruokchu, in bawsiet a, chu- taka chun, ‘LALPA dawkân chu sukpawrche a ni tah a, chutaka a theirahai khawm chu; chun, a buhai ngei khawm chu hmusitum a ni tah,’ in ta."
"Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah.","Chun, ‘Ngai ta u, nghawk a va um ngei de!’ in ta, in hnâr in hnâwt- khum a, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih. Chun, pâwngnêka lâk chu in hung lâk a, a kebai ruol, a damnaw ruol leh; chuong ang chun thilinhlân chu in hung lâk a na, hi in kut thilthaw hi ka pawmpêk ding cheu am a nih? sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.","Amiruokchu, a berâm ruol lai a chal, tiemkam sa tah neia, LALPA kuoma demuma inthâwi a, hlêmtu chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se: lal ropuitak ka ni sih a, ka hming khawm Jentailhai kuom chena khawm ṭi a um a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.","“Tuhin, aw nangni thiempuhai, hi thutiem hi in ta ding a nih."
"If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.","In ngai a, ka hming sukropui dinga, in lungrila in sie tlat naw chun, Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, in chunga chun ṭawngsie hung tir ka ta, in malsâwmnahai chu ṭawngsie inphur ka tih; anih, lungrila in sie tlat naw leiin, ṭawngsie kân phur nghâl tah a nih."
"Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and ye shall be taken away with it.","Ngai ta u, nangni leiin chu chi chu kâwk ka ta, in inthâwina êkhai chu in hmaihai chunga chun thêng ka ta, chun, a chu le chun nangni chu lâk hmangin um in tih."
"And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant may be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Ka thuthlung chu Levi kuoma chun a um theina dingin, hi thupêk hi in kuomah ka hung pêk a nih ti hre tâng in tih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.","Ka thuthlung chu ama ta ding chun hringna le muongna a na; a ṭi theina ding le, ka hming a ṭina ding le, ka hming ṭiha a ngîr theina dingin a kuoma chun ka pêk a nih."
"The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.","Thutak dân chu a baua chun a um a, fel nawna chu a hmûrhaia chun hmu a ni hrim hrim nawh; tluongtak le kei le inremin a khawsa a, mi tamtak chu khawhlonaa inthawkin ân her hmangtir tah a nih."
"For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.","Thiempu hmûrhai chun hriet- thiemna a vawng ding a na, a baua inthawk chun miin dân chu an zawng ding a ni sih a: ama chu sipaihai LALPA mitir chu a ni sih a."
"But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Amiruokchu, nangni chu lam- puia inthawk chun in pêt hmang a, mi tamtak chu dâna chun in insuithlûk- tir a; Levi kuoma thuthlung chu in suksiet tah a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.","Chuleiin, nangni khawm mi po po hmaa chun hmusitum le inhnuoiin ka lampuihai in hraw naw ang zûl peiin ka siem cheu a nih; dâna chun mi thlierbîk in lo nei ta si lem a,” tiin."
"Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?","Pa hmunkhat seng ei ni naw am a nih? Ei Pathien chun a mi siem seng a ni naw am a nih? Ei thlatuhai thuthlung chu bawsea, iengdinga mi tinin mâni unau chungah khaw- hlotaka ei thaw am a na?"
"Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god.","Juda chun khawhlotakin a lo thaw tah a, Jerusalem le Israel lai khawm chun tirdakumna chu thaw a lo ni tah a; Juda chun LALPAIN in- thiengna a hmangai chu a lo suk- pawrchein, pathien danglam naunu- hmei chu a lo nei tah a."
"Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts.","LALPA chun hi thil thawtu, inchûktirtu le a închûktir chu, Jakob puon ina inthawk sât thlâng a tih, sipaihai LALPA kuoma thilinhlânhai inhlântua inthawk le chun."
"And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.","Chun, hi khawm hi in thaw nâwk bawk a, LALPA mâichâm chu mitthli le, ṭapna le, thuokdawngnain in inkhum a, chuong lei chun thil inhlân chu a ngaisak ta nawin, in kuta inthawkin ṭhain a pawm ta naw hrim hrim a nih."
"Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.","Nangni chun, “Ieng leiin am ie?” in la ti ta rawp a, I thuthlung nuhmei le i kawppui ni sien khawm, a chunga khawhlotaka i lo thaw tah, i tleirâwl lai nuhmei le nanga kâra chun LALPA chu thuhretu a ni sih a."
"And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.","Chun, hringna chi chu a nei leiin, ama chun pakhatah a siem a ni naw am a nih? Ieng leia pakhata siem am a na? Pathien chi chu a zawng a nih. Chuleiin, in thlaraua chun fîm- khur unla mi tukhawma a tleirâwl nuhmei chu khawhlotakin thaw naw raw se."
"For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.","“Inmâk hi ka theida a nih,” LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun a tih, “mâni silfên inpâwngnêknaa inkhum leh,” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih. Chuleiin, in thlaraua chun fimkhur unla, khawhlotaka in thaw nawna dingin."
"Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of justice?","In thuhai chun LALPA chu in suksâwl a. Anachu, “Khâwlai am ama chu kan suksâwl a?” in ta. Chutaka bawk chun, “Mi tukhawm thil suol thaw chu LALPA mithmua chun ṭha a na, anni chunga chun a lâwm a; amanih, rorêlna Pathien chu khâwlai am a um a?” in ti bawk a."
"Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.","“Ngai ta u, ka tirko chu ka tir a, ama chun ka hmaah lampui chu buotsai a tih: chun, LALPA in izawng chu, a biekina chun hung nghâl a tih; chun, thuthlung tirko in ilâwm zâwng chu, ngai ta u, a hung ie,” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:","“Nisienlakhawm, a hungna nia chun tu am um thei a ta? Ama a hung inlang pha chun tu am ngîr a ta? Ama chu fiena mei ang le, puon sâwptu sabawn ang a ni sih a;"
"and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.","ama chu tangkaraw sukthiengtu le sukfaitu angin ṭhung a ta, Levi naupasalhai chu sukthieng a ta, anni chu rângkachak le tangkaruo angin sukfai a tih; chun, anni chun LALPA kuomah felnain thilinhlânhai chu inhlân an tih."
"Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.","Chun, Jerusalem le Juda thilin- hlân chu tienlai kumhai le inhma nihaia ang khan LALPA kuomah lâwmum ni tâng a tih."
"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the sojourner from his right, and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, rorêlnaah in kuom hung hnai ka ta; chun, inkhâmtu khêlin- hliphai chunga le uiretuhai chunga le, dawi hmangtuhai chunga chun thuhretu hrâttak hung nîng ka tih; a hlaw chungthua inhlawfa, hmeithai le, fahrahai nêksâwra, a thuneinaa inthawka mikhuol hnawt hmang hlaktu, kei mi ṭi ngailo chunga le chun, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.","“Kei LALPA hi ka danglam ngai si nawh a; chuleiin, nangni, aw Jakob naupasalhai, in bohmang naw a nih."
"From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?","“In thlatuhai hunhaia inthawkin ka thupêkhaia inthawk chun in inher hmang a, in lo pawm ta nawh a. Ka kuomah hung kîr unla, kei khawm in kuomah hung kîr ka tih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih. Nangni hlak chun, ‘khâwtieng am hung kîr kan ta?’ in ti lem a."
"Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.","Mihriemin Pathien chu ân rûk- pêk ding am a nih? Nangni chun in mi lân rûkpêk rawp el hi. Nisienla- khawm, nangni chun, ‘Ieng âm kan inrûkpêk che a?’ in ta. Sâwma pakhat pêkhaia le thilinhlânhaia hin a nih."
"Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.",Ṭawngsie chun ṭawngsie inphur in nih; hi hnam pumpui el hin in mîn rûkpêk sih a.
"Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.","Ka ina chun bu a um theina dingin, siekhâwmna ina chun sâwma pakhat po po chu hung la unla, chu- taka chun mi fie ro, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih. Vân tukverhai hung hawngin, a siena ding um naw khawp rauin, malsâwmna chu ka hung burpêk naw hrim cheu am."
"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, nangni lei chun a fa zotuhai chu hal ka ta, in leilunga rahai hrim hrim chu sukse dêr naw ni; chun, in loa in grêphrui khawm chun a hun hmain a ra chu sukṭil dêr naw ni, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, hnam tinhai chun vâng- nei tîng an ti cheu a, ram hlimumtak a hung ni ta ding a ni sih a, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?","“In thuhai chu ka chungah a hrawmhraw êm el, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih, Nangni chun, ‘Ieng âm kan hrilsiet che a?’ in ta."
"Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?","Nangni chun, ‘Pathien rawng- bâwl hi a thlâwn el a nih: a thupêk ei pawm a, sipaihai LALPA hmaa lungsetaka ei fe hi ieng am a ṭhathnemna a um a?"
"and now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.","Tuhin mi chapohai chu hamṭha ei ti a ni hi: anih, khawhlona thaw- tuhai chu tungding an na; anih, Pathien an fieh a, sansuok khawm an ni hi,’ in tih a,” tiin."
"Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.","Chun, LALPA ṭi mihai chu an inbiek tâwl a; chun, LALPA khawmin anni chu a ngai ngei a, a hriet a, ama hmaa chun hriet zingna lekhabu chu, LALPA ṭituhai le, ama hming ngaituo hlaktuhai ta ding chun ziekin a um tah a."
"And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.","Sipaihai LALPA chun, “Anni chu ka tahai nîng an ta, ro mak bîktak ka siemna nia ngei chun; chun, miin a naupa ama rawngbâwl- tu chu a hla hlak angin anni chu hlâng ka tih."
"Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.","Chun, hung kîr tâng in ta, Pathien rawng bâwl mi le a bâwl naw mi, thil khawhlo le thil fel chu thlier tâng in tih,” a ta."
"For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.","Sipaihai LALPA chun a tih, “Ngai ta u, ni chu a hung tlung a, rawtuina thuk angin a chawk sih a; chapotaka thawtuhai po po le, khaw- hlotaka thawtuhai po po chu pâwl kûng el nîng an ta: chu ni hung tlung chun anni chu kâng hmang a tih, a zung amanih, a kau amani khawm mâksanpêk dêr loin."
"But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.","Amiruokchu, nangni ka hming ṭituhai chunga ruok chun felna nisa, a thlahaia sukdamna leh hung suok a ta; chuongchun, fe suok in ta, ran ina bâwngtêhai inhnel angin inhnel tâng in tih."
"And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, mi khawhlo chu sirde tâng in ta; ni ka isiem ngei ding nia chun in kepha hnuoia chun pilvut ang el an ni ta ding a ni sih a, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.","“Israelhai po po ta dinga Horeba ka ipêk, rorêlna le thuruothai, ka siehlaw Mosie dân chu hre zing ro."
"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.","Ngai ta u, LALPA hungna ni ṭiumtak le nasatak hma ngei chun zâwlnei Elija chu hung tirpêk ka ti cheu."
"And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.","Ama chun pahai lungril chu nau- hai tieng innghatir a ta, nauhai lung- ril chu an pahai tieng; chuong naw chun hung ka ta, ram chu ṭawngsiein hung hrem rawi ka tih,” tiin."
