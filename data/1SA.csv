"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:","Ephraim tlâng rama Ramathaim- zophim khuoa chun mi pakhat a um a, a hming chu Elkana a nih; ama chu Jeroham naupa a na, ama chu Elihu naupa a na, ama chu Tohu naupa a na, ama chu Ephraim mi Zuph naupa a nih."
"and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","Nuhmei pahni a nei a, pakhat hming chu Hanna a na, a dang hming chu Peninna a nih; chun, Peninna chun nauhai a nei a, Hanna ruok chun nau a nei ve nawh a."
"And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.","Chun, ama chu an khuoa in- thawkin Silo khuoah sipaihai LALPA chu be dingin kum tin a hang fe hlak a. Chutaka chun Eli naupasalhai pahni, Hophni le Phinehas, LALPA thiempuhai chu an um a."
"And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:","Chun, Elkana inthâwi ni a hung tlung chun a nuhmei Peninna le a naupasalhai le a naunuhai po po chu chanvo a siempêk a."
"but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.","Hanna ta ding ruok chun chan hni a siempêk a, Hanna chu a hmangai êm êm sih a; nisienla- khawm, LALPAIN a sul a sukping- pêk a."
"And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.","Chun, LALPAIN a sul a suk- pingpêk leiin a lungngaina chu chawktho tumin a khingpui chun a lo thaw rawp hlak a."
"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.","Chuong anga kum tin a lo thaw hlak leiin, LALPA ina a hang fe zâtin a lungngaina chu amanu chun a lo chawktho hlak a. Chuleiin, Hanna chu a ṭap a ṭap a, bu khawm a fâk nawh a."
"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?","Chun, a pasal Elkana chun a kuomah, “Hanna, ieng dinga i ṭap am? Ieng dinga bu i fâk naw am a na? Ieng dinga i lungril i suknat am? Nau- pasal sâwm nêk khawmin i ta dingin ka ṭha lem a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.","Chun, Silo khuoa bu an fâk a an dâwn zo chun Hanna chu a tho a. Thiempu Eli chu LALPA biek in kawtkhâr ban bula a ṭhungnaa chun a ṭhung a."
"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.","Chun, Hanna chu a lungril a lunginzîng êm êm el a, LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a, lungsetakin a ṭap a."
"And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.","Chun, thu a tiem a, “Aw sipaihai LALPA, i suoknu tlâwmzie hi i hriet tak meu a, i mi hriet zing a, i suoknu hi i mi theinghil nawh a, i suoknu hi naupasal i pêk chun a dam sûng po chu LALPA pe ve thung ka ta, a lu khawm vâw hrim hrim ni naw ni,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.","Chun, LALPA hmaa a ṭawngṭai zing lai chun Eli chun a hmûr châng chu a lo inchik a."
"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.","Hanna chun a lungrilin a hril a, a hmûr chu a châng a, a râwl chu hriet a ni nawh a; chuleiin, Eli chun zu ân rui niin a ring a."
"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.","Chuongchun, Eli chun a kuomah, “Ieng chen am inrui zinga i um ding a na? I uoin chu sie hmang raw khai,” a ta."
"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.","Hanna chun a dawn a, “Ni lo, ka lalpa, nuhmei lungril lungngai tâwp- khâwk ka na; uoin khawm, zupui khawm ka dâwn dêr nawh a, LALPA hmaa chun ka lungril ka phawr lem a nih."
Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.,"I suoknu hi Belial naunuah inbûk naw raw khai; ka lungrila sip liem ka lungninawna le ka lung- ngaina ka hril a ni hi,” a ta."
"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.","Eli chun, “Lungmuongtakin fe raw khai, Israelhai Pathien chun i thil hni chu pe raw se che,” a tih a, a dawn a."
"And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more sad.","Ama chun, “I siehlawnu hi i mittlung ni raw se,” a ta. Chuong- chun, nuhmei chu a fe tah a, bu dâm a fâk a, lungngai hmêl a put ta nawh a."
"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her;","Chun, zingkâr an tho a, LALPA chu an biek a, an fe tah a, Rama khuoa an in chu an tlung nâwk tah a; chun, Elkana chun a nuhmei Hanna chu a pâwl a, chun, LALPAIN ama chu a hriet zing a."
"and it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Hanna chun nau a vawn a; a hun a hung tlung chun naupasal a nei a, “LALPA ka ihni a nih,” tiin a hminga chun Samuel a sak a."
"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.","Chun, Elkana le a sûnghai po po chu LALPA kuoma an kum tin inthâwina inhlân ding le an thutiem hlen dingin an hang feh a."
"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.","Hanna ruok chu a hang fe ve nawh a; a pasal kuoma chun, “Kei chu naute hin nêne nêk a bân hmakhat chu hang fe ve naw ning ah; chu pha ruok chun LALPA hmaha ân lang theina dingin ṭhuoi ka ta, chutaka chun um zing el tâng a tih,” a ta."
"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.","A pasal Elkana chun a kuomah, “Ṭha âwma i ti ang phawt chun thaw el rawh; a nêne nêk în bântir chenin um rawh, amiruokchu, LALPA chun a thu chu sukdet ngei raw se,” a ta. Chuongchun, a nêne nêk bân hma- khat chun nuhmei chu a um tah a, a naupa chu a enkawl a."
"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.","Chun, nêne nêk ân bântir phing chun beiphit epha khat le uoin saidawiûm khat chawiin sebâwng pathum leh a hang ṭhuoi a, Silo khuoa LALPA ina chun a fepui a; naupang chu a la naupang hleh a."
"And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.","Chun, bâwngchal chu an that a, naupang chu Eli kuoma chun an ṭhuoi a."
"And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.","Chun, ama chun, “Aw ka lalpa, i hringna sâlin ka hril a, kei chu aw lalpa, hi hmuna i kâwla ngîr a, LALPA kuoma ṭawngṭaitu nuhmei ka ni ngei a."
For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:,"Hi naupang hni hin ka ṭawngṭai a na, chun, LALPA chun ka hni chu a mi pêk tah a."
therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.,"Chuleiin, kei khawma LALPA kuomah kân hlân a nih; a dam sûng poa LALPA ta dinga inhlân a nih,” a ta. Chun, chutaka chun LALPA chu a biek a."
"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?","Chuongchun, Samuel chun hriek bâwm chu a hung lâk suok a, a lua chun a bur a, a fâwp a, “LALPA chun a rochan hai chunga hotu dingin hriek a nâl che a ni naw am a nih?

"When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?","Vawisûn hin i mi fesan hnungin, Zelzaah Benjamin ramria Rakil thlân kâwlah mi pahni hmûng i ta; chun, anni chun i kuomah, Sabengtung i zawnghai kha an hmu tah ie; chun, ngai ta, i pa chun sabengtung chu a ngaituo ta nawh a, nangma mawl a ngaituoh a, ‘Ka naupa chu iengtin am ka thaw ding a ni ta leh aw, a ti a ti el a,’ tîng an ta."
"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun fe pei la, Tabor thingsaisuo chu va tlung i ta, chutaka chun mi pathum, Bethela Pathien kuoma hang fe dinghaiin lo intuokpui an ti cheh a; pakhat chun kêlte pathum pawm a ta, pakhat chun beiphêk pathum chawi a ta, chun, pakhat chun uoin peng chawi bawk a tih."
"and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand.","Chun, chibai bûk an ti cheh a, beiphêk chu phêk hni pêng an ti cheh a; chu chu lâng i ta."
"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:","Chu hnunga chun Philistin sipai- hai umna Pathien tlâng chu va tlung i ta, chun, chutaka khuo i va tlung chun zâwlneihai perkhuong dâm, khuongtê dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm chawihai hma ṭhuoia bâwl- hmuna inthawka hung thla intuok- pui i ta; chun, thu hril duol duol an ta;"
"and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.","chun, LALPA thlarau nasatakin i chungah hung tlung a ta, nang khawm thu an hril duol duolnaa chun ṭhang vêng i ta, chun, mi danglam daiah inchang el i tih."
"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.","Chun, hieng inchiknahai hi i chunga a hung um pha chun thil hung umin a zir ang peiin i thaw ding a nih; Pathien chu i kuomah a um pei sih a."
"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.","Chun, ka fe hma hin Gilgala chun lo zu fe la, chun, ngai ta, kei khawm pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le in- remna inthâwinahai inhlân dingin i kuomah hung thlâng ka ta; i kuoma ka hung a, i thaw ding ka hung hril hma che chun ni sari i lo um ding a nih,” a ta."
"And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.","Chun, Samuel chu ṭhe dinga a hnungnghat phingleh Pathien chun lungril danglam dai a pêk tah a; chun, chuong inchiknahai po po chu chu ni chun a hung tlung ta vawng a."
"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.","Chuongchun, tlâng chu an hang tlung chun, ngai ta, zâwlneihai chun an intuokpui a; chun LALPA thlarau nasatakin a hung tlung a; thu an hril duol duolnaa chun a ṭhang ve tah a."
"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?","Chun, kha hmaa ama lo hre hlakhaiin zâwlneihai thu hril duol duolnaah a ṭhang ve ti an hriet chun mihai chu an inbiek a, “Kis naupa chunga thil hung um hi ieng am a ni ta leh? Saula khawm chu zâwlneihai lai a ṭhang ve am a ni el tah?” an ta."
"And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?","Chun, a umna khuoa mi pakhatin a dawn a, “An pa chu tu am a ni bîk leh?” an ta. Chuongchun, “Saula khawm chu zâwlnei a ni ve el ta a ni maw chu?” ti chu ṭawngna takah an hmang ta zing a."
"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.","Chun, an thu hril duol duolnaa a ṭhang zo chun bâwlhmun chu a tlung tah a."
"And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.","Chun, Saula pami chun a kuoma le a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Khâwlai am in feh a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Sabengtung kan zawng a nih, chun, kan hmu zo naw phingleh Samuel kuomah kan fe a nih,” a ta."
"And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.","Saula pami chun, “Samuel chun i kuomah ieng am a na a hril mi hril raw khai,” a ta."
"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.","Saula chun a pami kuoma chun, “Sabengtunghai chu an hmu tah ti a mi hril ngei kha tie,” a ta. Amiruok- chu, ram chungchâng thu Samuelin a hril chu a hril nawh a."
And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun mi- puihai chu Mizpaa chun LALPA kuomah a ko khâwm a;"
"and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:","Israel thlahai kuoma chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Israelhai chu Aiguptaa inthawkin ka ṭhuoi suok a, Aigupta mihai kuta inthawk le, a hnuoisietuhai cheu ram po poa in- thawkin ka sansuok cheu a."
"but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.","Nisienlakhawm, vawisûn hin in lunginzîngna po po le in rinumna po poa sanhimtu cheu in Pathien ngei chu in dit nawh a, a kuomah, A ni nawh, lal mi siempêk rawh’ in tih a. Chuleiin, tuhin a hnama hnam le a chia chiin LALPA hmaah hung inlang ro,” a ta."
"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun Israel chi po po chu a hung inlangtir a, chun, Benjamin chi chu thlang a lo ni tah a."
"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.","Chun, Benjamin chihai chu a sûngkuoin a hung inlangtir a, Matri mi sûngkuo chu thlang an lo ni tah a; chun, Kis naupa Saula chu thlang a lo ni tah a, nisienlakhawm, ama chu an hang zawng a, an hmu nawh a."
"Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu an hang indawn nâwk a, “Mi dang la hung ding an um am?” an ta. Chun, LALPA chun a dawn a, “Ngai ta u, thuomhnaw lai ân bihmang a nih,” a ta."
"And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.","Chuongchun, an tlân a, an va ṭhuoi suok a; chun, mipui lai a hang ngîr chun mi lai chun ân sâng tak el a, mi dang hrim hrim a liengko nêka insâng khawm an um nawh a."
"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Long live the king.","Chun, Samuel chun mi po po kuomah, “LALPA mi ruot hi in hmu am? Mipuihai po po lai ama ang hrim hrim an um nawh,” a ta. Chun, mipuihai chu an khêk a, “Pathienin laltak chu humhim raw se,” an ta."
"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun mi- puihai chu ram umdân ding chu a hril a, lekhabuah a ziek a, LALPA hmaa chun a sieh a. Chun, Samuel chun mipuihai chu mâni in tieng seng ân ṭintir tah a."
"And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.","Saula khawm chu Gibea khuoha a in tieng a fe tah a; mi huoisenhai, an lungril Pathienin a tâwkhai, chu a kuomah an fe veh a."
"But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.","Amiruokchu, Belial nauhai tu- haiin amani ruok chun, “Hi mipa hin iengtin am mi sandam thei hlak a ta?” an ta. Chuongchun, ama chu an ngainêp a, thilpêk hrim hrim an pêk nuom nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, ama chu a to zing a."
"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.","Chuongchun, Ammon mi Nahas chu a hung inthawk a, Jabes-Gilead thaw tumin a hang ep a; chun, Jabes mihai po po chun Nahas kuoma chun, “Kan kuomah thu thlung la, chuongchun, i rawng bâwl kan tih,” an ta."
"And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.","Ammon mi Nahas chun an kuomah, “Hieng ang hin a nih in kuoma thu ka thlung ding chu; in mit changtieng po po kheldawk vawng ding nîng a ta, chu chu Israel mi po pohai ta dinga hmingsietna nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.","Chun, Jabes khuoa upahai chun a kuomah, “Israel ram po poa mi kan hang tir theina dingin ni sari mi la ngai phawt rawh; chutaka a mi sandam ding tukhawm an um naw chun i kuomah hung suok el kan tih,” an ta."
"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.","Chuongchun, an mi tirhai chun Saula umna Gibea chu an hung tlung a, mipuihai na hrieta chun chuong thu chu an hril a, chun, mipuihai chun an râwl an insuoh a, an ṭap a."
"And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.","Chun, loa inthawkin Saula chu sebâwng hung khalin a hung a; Saula chun, “Ieng am an ti a na mipuihai chu an ṭap a?” a ta. Chun, Jabes khuoa mihai thuhril chu an hril a."
"And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hriet phingleh Saula chunga chun Pathien thlarau nasatakin a hung tlung tah a, nasatakin a lung chu a sen ta thut a."
"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.","Chuongchun, bâwng tuok khat a that a, a sa chu a chan nawi vawng a, Israel ram po poa chun ân semtir a; “Tukhawm Saula le Samuel hung zui nuom naw taphawt chu an sebâwng chu hieng anga thaw ve hi nîng a tih,” tiin. Chuongchun, mipuihai chun LALPA chu an ṭi tah a, an hung inthawk suok tah a."
"And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.","Bezek hmuna chun a tiem a; Israel mihai chu nuoi thum an nih, Juda mihai chu sing thum an na."
"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.","Chun, an mi hung tirhai kuoma chun, “Jabes-Gilead mihai kuoma chun, ‘Zîngah nisa lum vânglai tak hmain sansuok nîng in tih,’ va ti ro,” an ta. Chun, an mi tirhai chu an va feh a, Jabes mihai chu an va hril a: chuongchun, an lâwm ta êm êm a."
"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.","Chuongchun, Jabes mihai chun, “Zînga hin in kuomah hung suok kan ta, in nuom nuomin kan chunga hin thaw el ro,” an ta."
"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.","Chun, a zînga chun Saula chun mipuihai chu pâwl thumin a siem a; zîng vêng hun lai takin an riekhmuna chun an lût a.

"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.","Chun, mipuihai chun Samuel kuomah, “Tuhai am an na ‘Saula hin ei chungah ro a rêl el ding am a nih?’ tituhai kha?

"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel.","Saula chun, “Vawisûn kher hin chu tukhawm sukhlum ding a ni nawh ie, vawisûn hin LALPA chun Israelhai lai sandamna a hung siem ta sih a,” a ta."
"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.","Chun, Samuel chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Hung ro, Gilgala chun fêng ei tiu khai, chutaka chun ram hi indin thar nâwk ei tiu,” a ta."
And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.,"Chuongchun, mipui po po chu Gilgala chun an fe tah a, Saula chu Gilgala chun LALPA hmaah lalah an siem tah a.

"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.","Chun, Samuel chun Israel mi po pohai kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, ka kuoma in thuhrilhai po poa chun in râwl ka ngai a, lal ding chu ka siempêk ta cheu a."
"And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day.","Tuhin, ngai ta u, lal chun a lo keihruoi ta cheu a, kei chu ka hung tarin ka lu khawm ân ṭuok tah a; chun, ngai ta u, ka naupasalhai chu nangni lai an um a, ka tleirâwla inthawkin tu chen hin ka keihruoi cheu a."
"Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.","Hitaka hin ka um a, LALPA hmaa le a hrieknâl hmaa hin mi sêl ro le?

"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.","Anni chun, “I mi hlêm ngai nawh a, i mi suknawmna ngai bawk nawh a, tu kuta inthawk khawma lâk âwm lo chu i lâk ngai bawk nawh,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ka kuta hin âwm naw ieng khawm in hmu nawh ti vawisûn hin LALPA chu nangni laia hretu a nih; a hriek nâl khawm chu hretu a nih,” a ta.

"And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.","Chun, Samuel chun mipui kuoma chun, “Mosie le Aron ruottu le Aigupta rama inthawka in puhai ṭhuoi suoktu LALPA chu a nih in sawnnaw."
"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.","Chuongchun, ngîr ṭhap unla, LALPA hmaa hin LALPAIN in chunga le in puhai chunga thil a lo thaw fel dân hang sûtpui ka ti cheu."
"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.","Aigupta rama Jakob a lût hnung khan, in puhai chun LALPA an ko a, chuongchun, LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a tir a, anni chun in puhai chu Aigupta rama inthawkin an ṭhuoi suok a, hi hmuna hin an inumtir tah a."
"But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA an Pathien chu an theinghil a; chun, ama chun Hazor sipai hotu Sisera kuta le Philistin mihai kuta le, Moab lal kutah a zawr a, chun, anni chun an do a."
"And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.","Chun, LALPA chu an ko a, ‘LALPA chu kan nghatsan a, Baalhai, Astarothhai rawng kan bâwl leiin kan lo suol tah a nih; nisienlakhawm, kan hmêlmahai kuta inthawk hin mi sansuok ta la; chuongchun, i rawng- bâwl kan tih,’ an ta."
"And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.","Chun, LALPA chun, Jerubbaal hai, Bedan hai, Jephtha hai, Samuel hai a tir a, in hmêlma khingtieng khingtienga mihai kuta inthawkin a sansuok cheu a, himtakin in um a."
"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.","Chun, Ammon thlahai lal Nahas chu nangni do dingin a hung ti in hriet phingleh ka kuomah, ‘A ni nawh ie, lalin ro mi rêlpêk raw se,’ in tih a, LALPA Pathien chu in lal a ni zing sih a."
"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.","Chuleiin, in lal thlang le hni chu en ta u, LALPA chun lal a siempêk ta cheu a ni hi."
"If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, well:","LALPA chu in ṭih a, a rawng in bâwl a, a râwl in ngai a, LALPA thupêk in helsan nawh a, nangni le in chunga rorêltuhai leh LALPA in Pathien zuituhai in ni chun ṭhang a ta;"
"but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers.","amiruokchu, LALPA râwl chu ngai loa LALPA thupêk in helsan chun in puhaiin LALPA kut an tuor ang bawkin nangni khawma tuor in tih."
"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.","Chuongchun, ngir ṭhap unla, LALPAIN in mithmua thil ropuitak a thaw ding hi lo en ro."
"Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king.","Vawisûn hin bu an sîk a ni naw am a nih? Vân inrûmtir ding le ruo insûrtir dingin LALPA chu ko ka ta; chuongchun, lal in hni thua hin LAL- PA mithmua thil in thaw suol hi a nasatzie hi hrein hmûng in tih,” a ta."
So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun LALPA chu a ko a, LALPA chun chu ni chun vân ân rûmtir a, ruo ân sûrtir tah a; chuongchun, mipui chun LALPA le Samuel chu an ṭi ta êm êm el a."
"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.","Chun, mipui po po chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Kan thi nawna dingin LALPA i Pathien kuoma chun i siehlawhai hi mi ṭawngṭaipêk rawh, hi thil ṭha nawtak, lal kan lo hni hi, kan suol po po belsatu a ni ta hi,” an ta."
"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:","Chun, Samuel chun, mipuihai kuoma chun, “Ṭi naw ro, hi thil ṭha nawtak hi thaw chu in thaw ngei a, amiruokchu, LALPA in zui chun ama chu pêtsan chuong naw unla, in lungril po poin LALPA rawng chu bâwl lem ro;"
"and turn ye not aside; for then would ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.","iengkhawma ṭhahnem lo ding le sansuok thei lo ding cheu zuiin pêtsan naw ro, teplo mei mei an ni sih a."
"For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.","A hming ropuitak lei hin LALPA chun a mihai chu a nghatsan âwm si nawh a, a mihai ni dinga siem cheu chu LALPA lâwm zâwngtak a ni sih a."
"Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.","Chu chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, in ta dinga ṭawngṭai mah a, LALPA chunga suol chu keia ta ding khawma a âwm naw tawp a nih; lampui ṭha le lampui indik khîkhmu pei lem ka ti cheu."
"Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.","LALPA chu ṭi phawt el unla, in lungril po poin titakzetin a rawng bâwl unla, in ta dinga thil a thaw ropuizie hi ngaituo ro khai."
"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.","Amiruokchu, suoltaka thil in la thaw rawp chun bohmang in tih, nangni le in lal khawm,” a ta."
"Saul was forty years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,",Ro a rêl ṭan chun Saula chu kum sâwmthuma upa a na; Israelhai chungah kum hni ro a rêl a.
"Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.","Chun, Saula chun Israelhai laia mi sâng thum a thlang a, sâng hni chu Mikmasa le Bethel tlângah Saula kuomah an um a; sâng khat chu Benjamin rama Gibeaa Jonathan kuomah an um a; a dang po chu anni puon inah ân fetir vawng a."
"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.","Chun, Jonathan chun Gebaa Philistin râl vêngtu sipaihai a thawh a, chu chu Philistin mihai chun an lo hriet a. Chuongchun, Saula chun, “Hebrai mihai khan lo hre seng raw hai seh,” tiin an ram po poah taw- tawrâwt ân mûttir a."
"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.","Chun, Israelhai po po chun Saula chun Philistin râl vêngtu sipaihai a thaw ti le Israelhai khawmin Philistin mihai theida an phur a nih ti an lo hriet tah a. Chuongchun, mipuihai chu Gilgala chun Saula kuomah an pungkhâwm ta ṭeu el a."
"And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu Israel- hai do ding chun an inpun khâwm ta ṭeu el a, tawlailîr sîng thum, sakawr chung chuong mi sâng ruk, sipai chu tuisuoriet panga phaiphin zât zet an nih; chun, an hang feh a, Beth-aven saktieng panga Mikmasa chun ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.","Chun, Israel mihai chun hnaw- chêpin an um ti an inhriet chun, (mihai chu an lunginzîng ta hle el a) mihai chu pûka hai, chîmbuka hai, lungpui phêna hai, kula hai, khur sûnga hai an inbih a."
"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.","Hebrai mi ṭhenkhat chu Jordan râla Gad le Gilead rama dâm an tlân a; Saula ruok chu Gilgala chun a la um zing a, mipuihai chun inthin dawr dawr pumin an zui a."
"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.","Samuelin ni a ruot angin ni sari chu a um a, nisienlakhawm, Samuel chu Gilgala chun a la fe ta naw rawp a; chuongchun, mipui chun an tlân dar san tah a."
"And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.","Chun, Saula chun, “Pumraw- hmang thilinhlân ding le inremna thilinhlân dinghai chu hitakah ka kuomah hung la ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu ân hlân a."
"And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu ân hlân zo chaua, ngai ta, Samuel chu a hung tlung tah a; chun, Saula chun chibai bûk dingin ama tuok dingin a feh a."
"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;","Chun, Samuel chun, “Ieng am a ni leh i lo thaw chu?” a ta. Saula chun, “Mipuihai chun an mi fe hmangsan tah a; nang hlak chu ni ruot nia chun i hung tlung ta nawh a; Philistin mihai hlak chu Mikmasa chun an pung- khâwm huk tah ti ka hriet sih a."
"therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.","Chuleiin, ‘Philistin mihai chun Gilgala hin an mi hung thaw ding a ni ṭep sih a, LALPA lunginsietna hlak ka la hni si nawh a,’ ka tih a. Chu- leiin, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu inhlân naw thei ka ni naw a nih,” a ta."
"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuoma chun, “I thil thaw dân hi ân vêtthlâk ngawt el: LALPA i Pathien thupêk, thu a pêk che hi i zâwm naw a nih; LALPA chun Israelhai chunga în lalna hi kumkhuoa dinga sukdet tum chu a nih a."
"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin în lalna chu tâwp tâng a tih; LALPAIN thu a pêk che i zâwm naw leiin LALPA chun ama lungril ang put mi a zawng a, mihai chunga hotu ni dingin LALPAIN a ruot tah a nih,” a ta."
"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.","Chun, Samuel chu a tho a, Gilgala inthawk chun Benjamin rama Gibea khuoa chun a hang feh a. Chun, Saula chun a kuoma mi umhai chu a tiem a, za ruk lai an na."
"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.","Chun, Saula le a naupa Jona- than le an kuoma mi umhai chu Benjamin rama Geba khuoa chun an um a; nisienlakhawm, Philistin mi- hai chun Mikmasa chun ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;","Chun, râlrûk pâwlhai chu Philistin mihai ṭhanghmuna in- thawkin pâwl thumin an hung suok a; pâwl khat hai chun Shual rama Ophra tieng pan lampui an hrawh a,"
and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.,"chun, pâwl khat chun Beth- horon tieng pan lampui an hrawh a; chun, pâwl khat chun thlalêr dep Zeboim ruom tieng ngha ramri lampui chu an hrawh a."
"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:","Israel ram pumpuia chun thirsu hrim hrim an um nawh a; Philistin mihai chun, “Hebrai mihai hi kâwl- hnâmhai amanih, feihai amani hi siem hlau rawi an tih,” an ti a nih."
"but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;","Nisienlakhawm, Israel mihai po po chu bâwngtuthlaw dâm, hmawl hmawra inbûk thîr dâm chu intât- ngeitir dingin Philistin mihai kuom- ah an zu fe hlak a;"
"yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.","chuong an hnuoi inletna thîr ngei le bâwng tuthlaw tâtna man chu sekel hmun thuma ṭhea hmun hni a na, an hreipui le hmawl hmawra thîr inbûk tât man chu sekel hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a nih."
"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.","Chuongchun, an indo ni chun Saula le Jonathan kuoma mi umhai chun kâwlhnâm amanih, fei amanih nei hrim hrim an um dêr nawh a; Saula le a naupa Jonathan ruok chun an nei a."
And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.,"Chun, Philistin râl vêngtu sipaihai chu Mikmas kâwna chun an suok tah a."
"Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father.","Ni khat chu Saula naupa Jonathan chun a râlthuom chawitu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Hung ta, khingtieng râl Philistin mi râl vêngtu sipaihai umnaa sawn va fêng ei tih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, a pa chu a hril nawh a."
And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;,Saula chu Gibea ram hmawr tieng daia Migrona theibufai kûng hnuoiah a um a; a kuoma mi umhai chu za ruk amani lai an na.
"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.","Chun, Silo khuoa thiempu Eli naupa Phinehas naupa Ikabod naupa Ahitub naupa Ahija chu thiempu zakawsîng hâkin a um veh a. Chun, Jonathan chu a fe ti mipuihai chun an hriet nawh a."
"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.","Jonathanin Philistin mi râl vêngtu sipaihai umnaa fe a tumna kâwn le kâwn inkâra chun a khingtieng khingtieng chun lungpui indaw a um a, pakhat hming chu Bozez a na, a pakhat hming chu Sene a nih."
"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.","Lungpui indaw pakhat chu Mikmas hmârtieng panga um a na, a dang pakhat chu Geba zâwn simtieng panga um a nih."
"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.","Chun, Jonathan chun, a râl- thuom chawitu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Hung rawh, sertan lo sipaihai umnaa sawn va fêng ei tih; LALPA chun thil a mi thawpêk khiet rawi mawh; LALPA ta ding chun a tam amanih, a tlâwm amaniha sandam chu ieng- khawm a thei nawna a um chuong si nawh a,” a ta."
"And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.","Chun, a râlthuom chawitu chun a kuomah, “I lungrila um angtak chun thaw rawh, ngai ta, i lungril angtak chu ka lungril a nih,” a ta."
"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun “Hung ta, an kuoma sawn va kai ei ta, vân suklang ei tih."
"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.","Chun, ei kuomah, ‘In kuoma kan hung hmakhat chun la um ro,’ an mi ti chun, ei hmuna chun ngîr zing ei ta,an kuomah hang fe nâwng ei ta,"
"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us.","‘Kan kuom tieng hin hung ro,’ an ti ruok chun hang fêng ei ta, LALPAIN ei kutah a mi pêk a ni tah ti inchikna ning a tih,” a ta."
"And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.","Chun, an pahni chun Philistin mi râl vêngtu sipaihai hmuna chun an vân suklang a, chun, Philistin mihai chun, “En ta u, Hebrai mihai an inbîkna khursûnga inthawkin an hung suok tah,” an ta."
"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.","Chun, râl vêngtu sipaihai umnaa mihai chun Jonathan le a râlthuom chawitu chu, “Hung unla, thil ieng amanih lo inentir kan ti cheu,” tiin an lo ko a. Chun, Jonathan chun a râlthuom chawitu kuoma chun, “Mi hung zui raw khai, LALPA chun anni chu Israelhai kutah a pêk tah a nih,” a ta."
"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chu a kut le a ke hmangin a hang lâwn a, a râlthuom chawitu chun a zui a; chun, anni chu Jonathan hmaa chun an tlu ta zawt zawt a, a râlthuom chawitu chun a hung that ve pei a."
"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.","Chuongchun, Jonathan le a râlthuom chawituin an that hmasa tak ṭum chun ṭin chenve hmun ding ang vêla hin mi sâwmhni amani lai an that a nih."
"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.","Chun, riekhmuna mihai, phûla mi dâm, mipuihai po po chu an inthin a; chun, râl vêngtu sipaihai le râlrûkhai khawm chu an inthin veh a, chun, simkhawleihnuoi ân hning a, nasataka inthinna a um a."
"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.","Chun, Benjamin ram Gibeaa Saula râl vêngtuhai chun an hang thlîr vêl a, ngai ta, mipuihai chu an ṭe dar hum hum a, khingtieng khing- tiengah an invâk nuoi nuoi el a."
"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a kuoma mipui umhai kuoma chun, “Tuhin intiem unla, tuhai hai am an na a kim naw?” a ta. Chun, an hang intiem chun ngai ta, Jonathan le a râlthuom chawitu chu an lo um ve ta nawh a."
"And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel.","Chun, Saula chun Ahija kuoma chun, “Pathien bâwm chu hang la raw khai,” a tih a. Chuong lai chun Pathien bâwm chu Israel thlahai laia um a na."
"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, Saulân thiempu a biek zing lai dâm chun Philistin mihai riekhmun tienga buoi mur mur chu a zuol ta deu deu a; Saula chun thiempu kuoma chun, “I kut la kîr rawh,” a ta."
"And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.","Chuongchun, Saula le mipuihai po po chu an fe khâwm a, indonaa chun an fe tah a; chun, anni le anni kâwlhnâma lo inthaw rak a, lo buoi nuk nuk chu an hmu a."
"Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.","Chuongchun, chuong lai ram vêla mi riekhmuna hang fe ve, kha hma tienga Philistin mihai kuoma ṭhang Hebrai mihai khawm chu Saula le Jonathan kuoma um Israel mihai kuoma chun an hung ṭhang ve tah a."
"Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.","Chuong ang bawkin Ephraim tlâng rama Israel mi inbihmang po pohai khawm khan Philistin mihai an tlânhmang ti an lo hriet a, anni khawm chun indonaa chun ṭhangin an hnawt zui ve ta ngat ngat a."
So Jehovah saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN chu ni chun Israel mihai chu a sanhim tah a, chun, Beth-aven tlung rakin an thawh a."
"And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.","Chun, chu ni chun Israel mihai chu an lunginzîng a; nisienlakhawm, Saula chun, “Ka hmêlmahai chunga phuba ka lâk a, khuo a hung inhnu hmaa tukhawma bu a fâk chun ṭawng-sephurin um raw se,” tiin mi- pui chu a vau a. Chuongchun, tu- khawma bu chu intem khawm an intem dêr nawh a."
And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.,"Chun, mipui po pohai chun ramhnuoi an va tlung a, hnuoia chun khuoizu dâm a lo um a."
"And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.","Chun, mipuiin ramhnuoi an va tlung chun khuoizu dâm a lo luong a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawma an liek nawh, mipuihai chun inkhâmna chu an ṭi a nih."
"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.","Nisienlakhawm, Jonathan chu a pa chun mipuihai chu inkhâma a vau lai a hriet ve nawh a; chuongchun a hmawl chawi hmawr chu khuoi- thlâra chun a sunphûm a, a liek a, chuongchun, a mit meng chu a hung fie tah a."
"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint.","Chuongchun, mipui laia mi pakhat chun a lo dawn a, “I pa chun mipuihai hi, ‘Vawisûna bu fa taphawt chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se,’ tiin a mi vau tlat a, mipuihai khawm an chau hle hrim a,” a ta."
"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun, “Ka pa hin mihai a suklunginzing el a ni hi maw, en ta unla, khuoizu tlâwmte ka hang intem lei chauin ka mit meng a fie tâkzie hi."
"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.","Mipui hin an râllâk thil an hmu taphawt vawisûn hin an nuom nuomin fa thei hai sienla lem chu a va nasa nâwkzuol âwm de! chu lei tak chun Philistin mihai chu ei that nasa thei naw pha a ni hi,” a ta."
And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;,"Chuongchun, chu ni chun Mikmasa inthawkin Aijalon chenin Philistin mihai chu an thawh a; chun, mipuihai chu an châu hle el tah a."
"and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chun an râllâk thilhai chu a bawin an bawh a, berâmhai, bâwngchalhai, kêltehai an man a, hnuoia chun an sukhlum a, mipuihai chun a thisen pumin an fâk el tah a."
"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day.","Chuongchun, “Ngai ta, mipui- hai chun thisen puma fain LALPA chungah thil an suksuol tah,” tiin, Saula chu an hril a. Chun, ama chun, “Ringmawumtakin thil in thaw a nih, lung lientak mi hung inhlumpêk ro,” a ta."
"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.","Chun, Saula chun, “Mipuihai lai chun invâk dar vawng unla, an kuomah, ‘Mi tinin a sebâwng le berâm ka kuomah hung la sienla, hitaka hin hung that sienla, fa raw se, a thisen puma faa LALPA chunga thil suksuol loin, a tih,’ va ti ro khai,” a ta. Chun, chu zân chun mi po po chun mâni bâwngchal an hung kei seng a, chutaka chun an that a."
And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.,"Chun, Saula chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a, chu chu LALPA ta dinga mâichâm siem hmasa tak a nih."
"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.","Chun, Saula chun, “Zânah Philistin mihai chu zu thaw inla, zîng khawvar chenin rawk ei tiu khai, tukhawm hla hrim hrim nâwng ei tiu,” a ta. Chun, anni chun, “Ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,” an ta. Thiem- pu ruok chun, “Hi lai hin Pathien hnai phawt ei tiu khai,” a ta."
"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.","Chun, Saula chun Pathien a râwn a, “Philistin mihai chu ka zu thaw ding am a nih? Israelhai kutah i pêk ding am a nih?” a ta. Nisienla- khawm, chu ni chun a dawn nawh a."
"And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.","Chun, Saula chun, “Nangni mipui hotuhai po po kha hung hnai ta u khai, vawisûn hin a ieng tak am ei thaw suol a na ti hriet tum ei tiu khai."
"For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.","Israelhai sandam hlaktu LAL- PA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ka naupa Jonathan thilthawa khawm lo ni a ni chun a thi ngei ngei ding a nih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, mipui laia mi chun tukhawm a dawn hrim hrim an um nawh a."
"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po kuoma chun, “Nangni hi a tumin um khâwm unla; chun, kei le ka naupa Jonathan hi a tumin um kan tih,” a ta. Chun, mipuihai chun Saula kuomah, “Ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,” an ta."
"Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped.","Chuongchun, Saula chun LAL- PA Israelhai Pathien kuoma chun, “Ân diktak chu hung suklang rawh,” a ta; chun, aisan chu Jonathan le Saula chunga chun a tluh a, mipuihai ruok chu an fihlim a."
"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.","Chun, Saula chun, “Kei le ka naupa Jonathan hriet ṭhena dingin aisân ro,” a ta."
"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chunga chun a tlu tah a. Chun, Saula chun Jonathan kuoma chun, “Iengam a na i thaw mi hril raw khai?” a ta. Chun, Jonathan chun a hril a, “Ka hmawl chawi hmawrin khuoizu tlâwmte chu kân tem ngei el a, ngai ta, ka thi ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
"And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.","Chun, Saula chun, “Pathien chun a thaw thawin thaw el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawma, i thi ngei ding a nih, Jonathan,” a ta."
"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.","Chun, mipuihai chun Saula kuoma chun, “Israelhai laia hi san- damna ropuitak thawtu Jonathan hi a thi el ding maw? Teu lo e, LALPA hringna sâlin kan hril a nih, a sam zai khat khawm hi hnuoia tla hlek naw nih; vawisûn hin Pathien sin a thaw- pui a ni sih a,” an ta. Chuongchun, mipui chun Jonathan chu thi lo dingin an sanhim tah a."
Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.,"Chuongchun, Saulan Philistin mihai a hnawt chu a kîrsan tah a; chun, Philistin mihai khawm chu anni umna hmunah an fe tah a."
"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.","Saula chu Israelhai chunga rorêltua a hang ṭhang chun kil tina a hmêlma, Moab mihai, Ammon thla- hai, Edom mihai, Zoba lalhai dâm, Philistin mihai chu a do a; ân herna tienga taphawt chu a hne pei el a."
"And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.","Huoitakin a thawh a, Amalek mihai chu a hneh a, Israel mihai chu anni rawk hlaktuhai kuta inthawkin a sansuok a nih."
"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:","Saula naupasalhai chu Jona- than hai, Isvi hai, Malkisua hai an na, chun a naunuhmei pahnihai hming chu hieng hi a nih: a upa lem hming chu Merab a na, a naupang lem hming chu Mikal a nih."
"and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.","Saula nuhmei hming chu Ahinoam, Ahimaaz naunu a nih. A sipai hotuhai hming chu Abner, Saula pami Nera naupa a nih."
And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.,"Kis chu Saula pa a na, chun, Abner pa Nera chu Abiel naupa a nih."
"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.","Chuongchun, Saula dam sûng po po chun Philistin mihai le hin nasatakin an indo hlak a; chun, Saula chun mi hrât amanih, mi huoi amanih a hmu taphawt chu a lâk pei hlak a nih."
"And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “LALPAIN a mihai chungah, Israelhai chunga lal dinga hriek nâl ding chein a mi tir a nih; chuongchun, LALPA thuhril râwl chu ngai ta khai, Sipaihai LALPA chun."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.",‘Amalek mihai Israelhai chunga an thilthaw Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia an lo dodâl dân dâm kha kân chik zing a.
"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.","Amalek mihai do dingin fe la, an thil nei po po hla hrim hrim nei dêr loin sukbohmang vawng rawh; nu- hmei le pasal, naute khawm, nêne ne laihai dâm, bâwngchal le berâm dâm, sanghâwngsei le sabengtung dâm leh sukhlum vawng rawh,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
"And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.","Chuongchun, Saula chun mi- puihai chu a ko khâwm a. Telaim khuoa chun a tiem a, sipai nuoi hni le Juda mi sîng khat an nih."
"And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.","Chun, Saula chun Amalek mihai khuo chu a zu tlung a, ruoma chun a lo lambun a."
"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.","Chun, Saula chun Ken mihai kuoma chun, “Hung suok unla, Amalek mihai laia inthawk hin insie fihlîm ro, chuong naw chun sukhlum sa rawi ka ti cheu, nangni chun chu Israel thlahai po po Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok khan in lo lunginsiet sih a,” a ta. Chuongchun, Ken mihai chu Amalek mihai laia inthawk chun an suok tah a."
"And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.","Chun, Saula chun Amalek mihai chu Havilaa inthawka Aigupta ram dep Sur chenin a thawh a."
"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.","Chun, Amalek mihai lal Agag chu a hringin a man a, mipuihai po po chu kâwlhnâmin a sât hlum vawng a."
"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.","Amiruokchu, Saula le mipuihai chun Agag chu an hlah a, berâm ṭha ṭhahai, bâwngchal ṭha ṭhahai, a thau thau dâm, berâmte le a ṭha po po leh, chuonghai chu an sukhlum nuom nawh a; a ṭha naw le an dit naw po chu an sukhlum vawng a."
"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Samuel kuoma chun a hung tlung a."
"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.","“Saula hi lala ka ruot hi kân sîr ngawt el a nih; a mi zui lai chu a mi hnung innghatin ka thupêk angin a thaw si nawh a,” a ta. Chun, Samuel chu a lunginsen a, zânkhawvârin LALPA chu a ko a."
"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.","Chun, Samuel chu Saula tuok dingin zîngkâr chun a tho a, chun, “Saula chu Karmelah a feh a, ngai ta, chutaka chun hriet zingna lung a phun a; chun, a kir nâwk a, a fe pei a, Gilgala chun a zu fe tah,” tiin Samuel chu an hril a."
"And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chu Saula kuom tieng chun a fe tah a; chun, Saula chun a kuomah, “LALPAIN malsâwm raw se che, LALPA thupêk ang chun ka thaw tah,” a ta."
"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?","Chun, Samuel chun, “Chuong berâm inbe ka naa hung lût le, bâwngchal inbu ka hang hriet si chu iengtizie am a na?” a ta."
"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.","Chun, Saula chun, “Amalek mihai ta an hung lâkpêk a nih, LALPA i Pathien kuoma inthâwina dingin mipuihaiin berâm ṭha ṭhahai le, bâwngchal ṭha an hla a nih, chun a dang po po chu kan sukhlum vawng a nih,” a ta."
"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Ngai rawh, zâni zâna LALPAIN thu ka kuoma a hril, hril ka ti che,” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Hril raw khai,” a ta."
"And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;","Chun, Samuel chun, “Nanga ngaia chun mi chîntak ni la khawm, Israelhai hotu dinga siem i ni a ni naw am a nih? Chun, LALPA chun Israelhai lal dingin hriek a nâl cheh a;"
"and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.","chun, LALPA chun a tir suok cheh a. ‘Fe la, mi suolhai, Amalek mihai chu sukhlum vawng la, an bohmang dêr hmakhat chun thaw pei rawh,’ a ti cheh a."
"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?","Iengdinga LALPA thu chu zâwm lo a, râllâk thil chu a bawa i bawh a, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw i thaw el am?” a ta."
"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.","Chun, Saula chun Samuel kuomah, “E, LALPA thu ka zâwm annâwm, LALPA mi tirna tienga chun ka feh a; Amalek lal Agag ka hung man a, Amalek mihai chu ka sukhlum vawng annâwm."
"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.","Amiruokchu, mipuihai chun râllâk thil berâm le bâwngchalhai sukbohmang ding laia a ṭha ṭhahai chu Gilgal khuoa LALPA i Pathien kuoma inthâwina dingin an hung lâk a nih,” a ta."
"And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.","Chun, Samuel chun, “LALPA chun LALPA thu zâwm chu a lâwm angin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le inthâwinahai hi a lâwm am a nih? Ngai ta, inthâwina nêkin thuawi chu a ṭha lem a, berâmchal thau nêkin a thu pawm chu a ṭha lem a nih."
"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.","Helna hi aisan thiemna suolhai leh ân ang a, kawmâwna hi milim biek le rîtlona suol tluk a nih. LALPA thu i dit naw leiin ama khawma lal dingin a dit bîk ta naw che a nih,” a ta."
"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.","Chun, Saula chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Thil ka suksuol dêr a ni chu, LALPA thupêk le i thu chu ka lo bawsiet a ni zing chu tie; mipuihai ka ṭia an râwl ka lo ngai leiin."
"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.","Chuongchun, ka suol chu ngaidam la, LALPA ka biek theina dingin mi fepui nâwk rawh,” a ta."
"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Fepui naw tawp ka ti che, LALPA thu chu i dit si nawh a; chun, LALPA khawmin Israelhai lal dingin a dit bîk ta naw che a nih,” a ta."
"And as Samuel turned about to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.","Chuongchun, Samuel chu fe dinga a hang inher chun a puon hmawr chu a chel a, a tlêr tah a."
"And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.","Chun, Samuel chun a kuomah, “Vawisûna inthawk hin LALPA chun Israel ram hi a lâkpêk ta cheh a, i nêka ṭha lem i tuolbâwm a pêk tah a nih."
"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.","Chun, Israelhai Thahrui chu inkhêl naw nih a, inkîr bawk naw nih; mihriem anga inkîr nâwk el mi a ni nawh a,” a ta."
"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.","Chuongchun, ama chun, “Ka lo suol a ni tah a, nisienlakhawm, ka mihai upa le, Israelhai hmaa hin mi chawimawi dingin ka ngên che a nih; chun, LALPA i Pathien ka biek theina dingin mi fepui hrâm bawk la,” a ta."
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun Saula chu a fepui tah a; Saula chun LALPA chu a biek tah a."
"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.","Chun, Samuel chun, “Amalek mihai lal Agag chu ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Agag chu a kuoma chun inthin pumin a va feh a. Chun, Agag chun, “Thina kha chu ka pumpel ta chu ni âwmtak a na,” a ta."
"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.","Chun, Samuel chun, “I kâwl- hnâmin nuhmeihai nau boa a siem angin i nu khawm nuhmei laia nau bo mi nîng a tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Samuel chun Agag chu Gilgal khuoa chun LALPA hmaah a sât nawi neng el tah a."
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.,"Chun, Samuel chu Rama khuo- ah a feh a; chun, Saula chu a umna khuo Gibeaa chun a hang fe tah a."
And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun a thi ni chenin Saula chu a sir nâwk ta nawh a; amiruokchu, Samuel chu Saula leiin a lungngai a nih; chun, LALPA khawm chu Israelhai lal dinga Saula a lo siem chu ân sîr a nih."
"And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel kuomah, “Israel mihai lal dinga ka dit ta naw hnung chu Saula lei hin ieng chen am i lungngai ding a ni leh? I kiah hriek thun sip la, fe rawh; Bethlehem mi Jesai kuomah ka tir ding che a nih, a naupasalhai laia mi lal dingin ka ruot zing tah a nih,” a ta."
"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun, “Iengtin am fe thei ka ti leh? Saula chun a lo hriet chun mi sukhlum el a tih,” a ta. Chun, LALPA chun, “Bâwngla ṭhuoi la, ‘LALPA kuoma inthâwi dinga hung ka nih,’ ti el rawh."
"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.","Chun, inthâwinaa chun Jesai chu ko la; chun, i thaw ding chu hril ka ti cheh a; chun, a hming ka hril ding che chu hriek mi nâlpêk rawh,” a ta."
"And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?","Chuongchun, Samuel chun LALPA hril ang chun a thaw a, Bethlehema chun a fe tah a. Khuoa upahai chun inthin pumin ama an lo tuok a, “Thu ṭhaa hung am i nih?” an lo tih a."
"And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.","Ama chun, “Thu ṭhaa hung nih e, LALPA kuoma inthâwi dinga hung ka nih; insukthieng unla, inthâwinaah hung ve ro,” a ta. Chun, Jesai le a naupasalhai chu a sukthieng a, inthâwinaa chun a ko ve a."
"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before him.","Chun, an hung chun, Eliab chu a lo en a, “LALPA hrieknâl chu a hmaa um hi a ni ngei el,” a ta."
"But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for Jehovah seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Samuel kuoma chun, “A hmêl tieng amanih, ân sang tieng amanih en naw rawh, ama hi chu ka dit naw a nih, LALPA chun mihriem en dân angin a en ve si nawh a, mihriem chun puotienga inlang dân an en hlak a, LALPA ruok chun lungril tieng a en lem hlak a nih,” a ta."
"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.","Chun, Jesai chun Abinadab a hei ko a, Samuel hmaa chun ân fetir a. Ama chun, “Hi khawm hi LALPA thlang a la ni nawh,” a ta."
"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.","Chun, Jesai chun, Samma a vân fetir nâwk a. Ama chun, “Hi khawm hi LALPA thlang a la ni naw ta rawp,” a ta."
"And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.","Chuongchun, Jesai chun a nau- pasal pasari hai chu Samuel hmaa chun ân fetir a. Chun, Samuel chun Jesai kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng- hai khawm hi a thlang nawh,” a ta."
"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.","Chun, Samuel chun Jesai kuomah, “Hitaka hin i nauhai an um kim vawng am?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “A naupang tak a la um a, ngai ta, berâm a vêng a nih,” a ta. Chun, Samuel chun Jesai kuomah, “Vân kotir raw khai, a hung tlung hmakhat chun ei awt naw ding a nih,” a ta."
"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.","Chuongchun, a vân kotir a, a hung ṭhuoi a. Ama chu sâr veng vawng, mit meng mawitak, en dâwl- tak el hi a na. Chun, LALPA chun, “Tho la, hriek nâl rawh, hi ngei hi a nih,” a ta."
"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun hriek bâwm ki chu a lâk a, a unauhai lai chun ama chu hriek a nâl a, chun, LALPA thlarau chu nasatakin chu nia inthawk chun David chunga chun a hung tlung tah a. Chuongchun, Samuel chu a tho a, Rama khuoah a fe tah a."
"Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.","LALPA thlarau chun Saula chu a suoksan a, LALPA tir khawhriin ama chu a sukbuoi a."
"And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.","Chun, Saula siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Pathien tir khaw- hriin a sukbuoi che a nih."
"Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.","Tûn kan lalpa hin i siehlaw i hmaa umhai hi ṭingṭang kei thiemtak zawng ding thu mi pe raw khai, chuongchun, Pathien tir khawhriin a man pha che khawm, kei a ta, ṭha el hlak i tih,” an ta."
"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.","Chun, Saula chun a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Kei thiemtak chu mi zawngpêk unla, ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro le,” a tih a."
"Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl pakhat chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Bethlehem mi Jesai naupa pakhat chu ka hmu tah a, ama chu kei thiem- tak, mi huoitak, indo mi, thuhril thiemtak, hmêl ṭhatak a nih; a kuomah LALPA khawm a um a nih,” a ta."
"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.","Chuongchun, Saula chun Jesai kuoma chun mi a tir a, “I naupa David berâm vênga um chu ka kuomah inhungtir rawh,” a ta."
"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.","Chun, Jesai chun sabengtung, bei le uoin peng khat phur le, kêlte a lâk a, a naupa David chu Saula pêk dingin ân chawitir a."
"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.","Chun, David chun Saula kuom chu a va tlung a, a hmaa chun a va ngîr a, ama chun a lo ngaina êm êm el a; a râlthuom chawituah a ṭhang tah a."
"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.","Chun, Saula chun Jesai kuom- ah, “David hi ka kuomah um raw se, ka mit a tlung hle el,” tia hril dingin mi a tir a."
"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, Pathien tir khawhriin Saula chu a man po leh, David chun ṭingṭang a lâk a, a kei hlak a; chuongchun, Saula chu a hung har a, a ṭha nâwk hlak a; chun, khawhri chun a suoksan hlak a."
"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun indo dingin an sipaihai an kei khâwm ṭeu el a. Judai ram sûng Soko khuoah an pungkhâwm a; Ephes- dammim hmunah Soko khuo le Azeka khuo inkâra chun ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.","Chun, Saula le Israel mihai chu an pungkhâwm a, Ela ruomah ṭhang- hmun an khuor a, Philistin mihai chu lo dang dingin an inzar dar a."
"And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu tlâng pangah an um a, chun, Israel mihai chu khingtieng tlâng panga chun an um a, an inkâra chun ruom a um a."
"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.","Chun, Philistin mihai ṭhang- hmuna inthawk chun an mi hrât, Goliath, Gath khuoa mi, tawng ruk le khâp khata insâng hi a hung suok a."
"And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.","Dâr lukhum hi a khum a, âwmphaw a hâk a, a âwmphaw rikzie chu dâr shekel sâng nga a nih."
"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.","A ngala chun dâr ngalphaw a bun a, a ruongzânga chun dâr feite a pai a."
And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.,"A fei ngul chu puonkawl ang hi a na, a fei lu chu thîr shekel za ruka rik a nih; chun, a phaw chawitu chu a hmaa chun a feh a."
"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.","Chun, a ngîr a, Israelhai sipaihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Iengdinga indo dinga in hung inzar dar am a na? Kei Philistin mi, nangni Saula siehlawhai in nih a ni naw am a nih? Mi inthlang unla, ka kuomah hung thla raw se."
"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.","A mi thaw thei a, a mi sukhlum chun in siehlawah um kan ta, ami- ruokchu, keiin ka ngam a, ka sukhlum chun kan siehlawah um in ta, kan rawngbâwl in tih,” a ta."
"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.","Chun, Philistin mi chun, “Vawi- sûn hin chu Israelhai sipaihai chu ka cho a nih, mi pakhat hung thaw unla, lo inthâwng kan tih,” a ta."
"And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.","Chun, Saula le Israelhai po poin chu Philistin mi thuhril an hriet chun an ṭih a, an inlau ta êm êm el a."
"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men.","Chun, David chu Jesai naupa a na, ama chu Bethlehem-Judaa Ephrath mi kha a na, naupasal pariet a nei a; ama chu Saula inlal lai chun tartak a ni tah a, tarsiea ngai a ni tah."
"And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.","Chun, Jesai naupasal upahai pathum chun indonaa chun Saula an zui a. A naupasal pathum indonaa fehai hming chu a upa tak Eliab hai, a dawttu Abinadab hai, a pathumna chu Samma hai an nih."
And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.,"Chun, David chu a naupang tak a na, chun, a upahai pathum chun Saula an zui a."
Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem.,David chu Saula kuoma in- thawkin a pa berâm enkawl dingin Bethlehema chun a va fe a va fe hlak a.
"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.","Chun, Philistin mi chun zîngkâr le zântieng po hin a va hnai hlak a, ni sâwmli sûng zet chu a vân târlang hlak a."
"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren;","Chun, Jesai chun a naupa David kuoma chun, “Bu zeu epha khat le hi bei tlang sâwm hi chawi la, i unauhai kuomah riekhmunah va fepui vak raw khai;"
"and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.","chun, nêne tui kîng tlang sâwm hi an pâwla sâng hotu chawipêk la, chun, i unauhai iengtin am an um hung indawn la, an chanchin hrietna hung phur rawh."
"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.","Saula le anni le Israel mi po po chu Philistin mihai doin Ela ruoma chun tûn an um a nih,” a ta."
"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.","Chun, David chu zîngkâr a tho a, berâmhai chu vêngtu pakhat ân kawltir a, Jesaiin thu a pêk ang chun a chawi a, a fe tah a; chun, indona hmuna suok mêk sipaihai chu inthaw dinga an lo khêk dur dur lai takin ama chu tawlailîr umna hmun chu a va tlung a."
"And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.","Chun, Israel mihai le Philistin mihai chu indo ding chun an lo inzar a, sipai le sipai chu an lo inep a."
"And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.","Chun, David chun a thuom- hnaw chu thuomhnaw enkawltu kuoma chun a sieh a, indona hmun tieng chun a va tlân a; a uhai chu chibai a va bûk a."
"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.","Chun, anni a biek lai chun, ngai ta, an mi hrât Gath khuoa Philistin mi a hming Goliath chu Philistin mihai sipai pâwl laia chu a hung suok a, a thuhril ngai bawk kha a hung hril a, chu chu David chun a lo hriet zing a."
"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.","Israel mihai po po chun ama chu an hei hmu chun an tlânseh a, an ṭi êm êm el a."
"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.","Chun, Israel mihai chun, “Kha mihriem a hung suokpa kha in hmu am?

"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?","Chun, David chun a kâwla ngîrhai kuoma chun, “Hi Philistin mi hi sukhlum a, Israelhai hmingsietna sukbotu chu iengti anga thaw ding am nîng a ta? Hi sertan lo Philistin mi hi tu am a na Pathien hring sipaihai a hei cho vei chu?” a ta."
"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.","Chun, mipuihai chun hieng ang hin an dawn a, “A sukhlumtu ta- phawt chu kan hril anga kha thaw ding a nih,” an ta."
"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.","Chun, a u, a upa tak Eliab chun mihai kuoma a thu hril lai chu a lo hriet a: chuongchun, Eliab chu David chunga chun a lunginsen ta thut a, “Iengdinga i hung thla ve am a na?

"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?","Chun, David chun, “Ieng am ka thaw ta leh? A san a um a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.","Chun, ama chun mi dang kuom tieng a nghatsan a, a hril ngai bawk a hril a; chun, mipuihai chun a hmaa an dawn ang bawk khan an dawn a."
"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.","Chun, David thuhril chu an hrietin Saula kuomah an hrilsâwng a; chun, ama chun a ko a."
"And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.","Chun, David chun Saula kuom- ah, “Ama lei chun tu lungril khawm ṭi naw raw se; i siehlaw hin chu Philistin mi chu va thâwng ka tih,” a ta."
"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.","Chun, Saulân David kuomah, “Nang chu, hi Philistin mi hi thaw dingin fe thei êm naw ti nih ie, tleirâwl el i la ni sih a, ama chu a tleirâwl tîra inthawka indo mi a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,","Chun, David chun Saula kuom- ah, “I siehlaw hin ka pa berâm ka vêng hlak a, sakeibaknei amanih, savawm amanih a hunga berâm ruol laia berâmte dâm a lâk hin,"
"I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.","ka hnawt a, ka thawh a, a baua inthawk chu ka sansuok hlak a nih; chun, mi thaw dinga a hung inthawk dâm hin a bakhmulah ka man a, ka thawh a, ka sukhlum hlak a nih."
"Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.","I siehlaw hin sakeibaknei le savawm khawm ka sukhlum ve ve ta hlak a; chu sertan lo Philistin mi chu anni ang bawk chun um ve el a ti maw le, Pathien hring sipaihai a cho vei a,” a ta."
"And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.","Chun, David chun, “Sakeibak- nei kutbâwra inthawk le, savawm kutbâwra inthawka mi sansuoktu LALPA chun chu Philistin mi kuta inthawk chun mi sansuok a tih,” a ta. Chun, Saula chun David kuoma chun, “Fe raw le, i kuomah LALPA um a tih” a ta."
"And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.","Chun, Saula chun David chu ama thuomin a thuom a, dâr lukhum ân khumtir a, âwmphaw ân hâktir a,"
"And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.","Chun, David chun thuom chunga chun a kâwlhnâm a pai a, fe a hang tum a, chuong ang chun a la thaw sin ngai si nawh a. Chun, David chun Saula kuomah, “Ka fepui thei dêr âwm nawh a, hieng ang hin ka la thaw sin ngai nawha a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chu ân hlîp tah a."
"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.","Chun, a hmawl chu a chawi a, vadungtêa lung inmûm ṭhelṭhawl panga a thlang a, a berâm vêngna mansaa chun a pai a; chun, a vailungdêng chu a chawi a, Philistin mi chu a va hnai tah a."
And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.,"Chun, Philistin mi chu a hung a, David chu a hung pan hnai a; chun, phaw chawitu chu a hmaa chun a feh a."
"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.","Chun, Philistin mi chu a hang ngha vêl a, David chu a hmu chun a hmusit hle el a; sâr hlerhlawr, mit meng mawitak, tleirâwl el a ni sih a."
"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.","Chun, Philistin mi chun David kuoma chun, “Ui am ka nia hmawl le dâm i mi hung pan chu le?” a ta. Chuongchun, Philistin mi chun a pathienhai sâlin David chu ṭawngsie ân phur tah a."
"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.","Philistin mi chun David kuom- ah, “Hung ta, i sahai kha ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai lo infâktir ka tih,” a ta."
"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.","Chuongchun, David chun Philistin mi kuoma chun, “Nang chu kawlhnâm dâm, fei dâm, phaw dâm chawiin i hung inthawk a, kei chu sipaihai LALPA Israel sipaihai LAL- PA i cho hmingin ka hung inthawk lem a nih."
"This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,","Vawisûn hin LALPAIN nang hi ka kutah a mi pêk ding a nih, chun, that ka ti cheh a, i lu ka tanpêk ding che a nih; chun, Philistin sipaihai ruong chu vawisûn hin ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai kân fâktir ding a nih; chuongchun, hnuoi chunga mi po po hin Israelhai lai hin Pathien a um ti hre thei an tih;"
"and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah’s, and he will give you into our hand.","chun, hitaka pungkhâwmhai po po hin LALPA chun kâwlhnâm le feiin a sandam nawh ti hre thei an tih; indona chu LALPA indona a ni sih a, ama chun kan kuta hin nangni hi a mi pêk ding a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.","Chun, Philistin mi chu a hung inthawka David chu thaw dinga a hung hnai chun David chu sipaihai tieng chun Philistin mi chu thaw dingin a tlân ta vat a."
"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.","Chun, David chun a mansa chu a hang pur a, lung a keidawk a, a vailungdêng chun a hei dêng a, Philistin mi chu a bâwk taka chun a hei dêng a, a bâwka chun lung chu a lût a, a tlu bawkkhup ta dêr el a."
"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.","Chuongchun, David chun Philistin mi chu vailungdêng le lungin a ngam a, Philistin mi chu a dêng a, a that tah a; David chun kâwlhnâm a chawi dêr nawh a."
"Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.","Chuongchun, David chu a tlân a, Philistin mi kâwla chun a va ngîr a, a kâwlhnâm chu a lâk a, a bâwma inthawk chu a phawi a, chu chun a that a, a lu a tan tah a. Chun, Philistin mihai chun an mi hrât chu a thi ti an hriet chun an tlânse tah a."
"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.","Chun, Israel mihai le Juda mi- hai chu an tho a, an khêk a, Philistin mihai chu Gath chen le Ekron kul kawtkhâr chen rakin an hnawt tah a. Chun, Philistin mihai laia hliemhai chu Saaraim lampui intluonin Gath le Ekron chen chun an tlu phung el a nih."
"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.","Chun, Israel thlahai chun Phi- listin mihai an hnawt chu an kîrsan a, an riekhmun chu an suom tah a."
"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.","Chun, David chun Philistin mi lu chu a lâk a, Jerusalemah a fepui a, a râlthuom ruok chu a puon inah a sieh a."
"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.","Chun, Saulan Philistin mihai thaw dinga David a fe lai a hmu khan sipai hotu Abner kuoma chun, “Abner, hi tleirâwl hi tu nau am a na?” a ta. Chun, Abner chun, “I hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih, aw lalpa, ka hriet dêr nawh a,” a ta."
"And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.","Chun, lal chun, “Hi naupang hi tu nau am a na, indawn suok raw khai,” a ta."
"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.","Chun, David chu Philistin mi a that a hung chu Abner chun a ṭhuoi a, Philistin mi lu chu chawi pumin Saula kuomah a fepui a."
"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.","Chun, Saula chun, “Tu naupa am i nih a, tlangvâl?” a ta. David chun a dawn a, “Bethlehem mi i siehlaw Jesai naupa ka nih,” tiin, a dawn a."
"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.","Chun, Saula kuoma thu a hril zo chun Jonathan hringna le David hringna chu a lo inzawm ta chie el a, chuongchun, Jonathan chun ama hringna a hmangai ang chiein a hmangai tah a."
"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.","Chun, Saula chun chu ni chun ân umtir ta nghâl a, a pa ina chun ân fetir phal ta nawh a."
"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.","Chuongchun, Jonathan le David chun thu an thlung a, ama hringna ang chiea a hmangai leiin."
"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.","Chun, Jonathan chun a puon sil lai a hlîp a, David chu a pêk a, a thuom le a kâwlhnâm le a thalngul le a kâwng khitna chenin a pêk a."
"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.","Chun, Saula chun a tirna ta- phawta chun David chu a fe hlak a, feltakin a châng pei a; chun, Saula chun râl kâp mihai hotu dingin a siem a, chu chu mi po po ngaia le Saula siehlawhai ngaia khawm a ṭha êm êm a."
"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.","Chun, an hung inlawi a, Philistin mi thata David a hung kîr chun Israel khaw tinah, nuhmeihai hla sak le lâm pumin khuongtê le thil inri theihai leh, hlimtakin lal Saula tuok dingin an hung suok a."
"And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.","Chun, nuhmeihai chun lâm pum- in hlain an indawn tuoh a. “Saulain a sânga sâng a that a, Davidin a sînga sîng a that a,” an tih a."
"And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?","Chuongchun, Saula chu a lung- insen ta vieu el a, chuong thu chun ama a suklâwm naw hle el a, “David chu a sînga sîng thatah an ngai a, kei ruok chu a sânga sâng chau thatah an mi ngai a: ram ti chau lo chu ieng am a nei ding dang a um ta leh?” a ta."
And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.,"Chuongchun, chu nia inthawk chun Saula chun David chu a hmusiet tah a."
"And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;","Chun, a zînga chun Pathien tir khawhri Saula chunga chun a hung tlung ta rak el a, in sûnga chun thu chu a hril ta nuk nuk el a, chun, David chun ni danga a thaw dân ang bawkin ṭingṭang a kei a: Saula chun a fei chu a chawi zing a."
"and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.","Chun, Saula chun fei chu a hang inlet a, “Banga sawn David khâw de tlat ka tih,” a ta. David chun vawi hni ân kiensan a."
"And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.","Chun, a kuoma LALPA a um lei le, Saula chu a fesan leiin Saula chun David chu a ṭih a."
"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.","Chuleiin, Saula chun a kuoma inthawkin ân sawntir a, sâng chunga sipai hotuah a siem a, chun, mipuihai lai chun a lûtin a suok hlak."
And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.,"Chun, David chu a thilthaw taphawtah feltakin a châng hlak a, LALPA chu a kuomah a um a."
"And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.","Chun, Saula chun feltakin a châng hlak ti a hmuin a ṭi hle el a."
But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.,"Nisienlakhawm, Israelhai le Judahai po po chun David chu an ngaina êm êm a, anni laia lûta suok hlak a ni sih a."
"And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah’s battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.","Chun, Saula chun David kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, ka naunuhmei upa lem Merab hi nuhmeiah inneitir ka ti che, huoitakin mi ṭan phawt el la. LALPA indonahai chu do rawh,” a ta. Saula chun, “Kei chun chu a chunga hin kutthlâk loin, Philistin mihaiin thlâk lem raw se,” a ti a nih."
"And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?","Chun, David chun Saula kuom- ah, “Tu am ka na, ka hringna le Israelhai lai ka pa sûnghai chu ieng am an na, lal mâkpa ka hang nina san ding chu?” a ta."
"But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.","Nisienlakhawm, Saula naunu Merab chu David inneitir a hung hun chun Meholath mi Adriel nuhmei dingin a pêk ta el a."
"And Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.","Chun, Saula naunu Mikal chun David chu a hmangai a, Saula chu an hril a, chu chun a suklâwm a."
"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.","Chun, Saula chun, “A âwkna châng a hung ni theina dingin le Philistin mihaiin a chunga kut an thlâk theina dingin ama hi pêng ka tih,” a ta. Chuleiin, Saula chun David kuoma a vawi hninaah chun, “Vawisûn hin ka mâkpa ning i tih,” a ta."
"And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a siehlawhai chu thu a pêk a, “Inrûk takin David be unla, ‘Ngai ta, lal chu i chungah a lâwm hle el a, a siehlawhai po po khawma an hmangai che a nih; chuongchun, lal mâkpaa hin um el rawh,’ ti ro,” a ta."
"And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?","Chun, Saula siehlawhai chun chuong thuhai chu David na hrieta chun an hril a. David chun, “Mi pasie le tukhawm ingaisâng naw keia ta ding hin lal mâkpa hang ni chu thil namênah in ngai am a nih?” a ta."
"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.","Chun, Saula siehlawhai chun, “David chun chuong ang chun a ti a nih,” tiin an hril a."
"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.","Chun, Saula chun, “David kuoma chun hieng ang hin ti ro khai, ‘Lal chun lal hmêlma phubalâkna dingin Philistin mihai servun za ti naw chu man ieng dang khawm a dit nawh,’ tiin,” a ta. Saula chun David chu Philistin mihai kuta inthitir a lungril tlat a."
"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired;","Chun, a siehlawhaiin chuong thu chu David an hang hril chun, lal mâkpa a hang ni ding chu David chu a lâwm hle el a. Chun, ni tiemhai chu a la tling nawh a."
"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.","David le a mihai chu an tho a, Philistin mi za hni an va that a: David chun an ser vun chu a hung phur a, chuongchun, lal mâkpa a ni theina dingin lal chu kimtakin an pêk a.

"And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.","Chun, Saula chun David kuoma chun Pathien a um a nih ti a hriet chieng tah a: chun, Saula naunu Mikal chun ama chu a hmangai a."
And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.,"Chuongchun, Saula chun David chu a ṭi zuol ta sau a, Saula chu David hmêlma a ni kumkhuo el tah a."
"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.","Chuongchun, Philistin mi lien- hai chu an vân thawk hlak a; chun, an hung inthawk dawk po leh David chu Saula siehlawhai po po nêka fel lemin a châng hlak a, chuongchun, a hming chu an chawisâng hle el tah a."
"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a naupa Jonathan le a siehlaw- hai po po chu David chu that dingin a hril a."
"And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:","Nisienlakhawm, Saula naupa Jonathan chun David chu a ngaina hle el a. Chuongchun, Jonathan chun David chu, “Ka pa Saula chun that a tum cheh a, chuleiin, zîngah zîngkâr chun fîmkhur la, hmun inthupah inbi zing raw khai;"
"and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.","chun, fe suok ka ta, i umna phûlah ka pa kâwlah va ngîr ka ta, i chungchâng thuah ka pa bieng ka ta, ieng amanih ka hriet chun hril ka ti che,” a ta."
"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:","Chun, Jonathan chun a pa Saula hmaa chun David chu ân pâk a, a kuomah, “Lal chun a siehlaw chung- ah, David chunga hin thil suol thaw lul naw raw se, i chungah iengkhawm a suksuol si nawh a, a thilthawhai chu i ta dinga ṭhatak a ni sih a;"
"for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?","thi dâwn loin Philistin mi kha a thawh a, chun LALPAIN Israel mihai po po sandamna ropuitak a thaw- suokpêk a, chu chu nang khawma i hmuh a, lâwm khawm i lâwm hle kha; chuleiin, a san iengkhawm um loa David chu thatin, ieng dingin am thisen pawi tâwklo chunga chun thil suksuol el i ta?” a ta."
"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death.","Chuongchun, Saula chun Jona- than rawl chu a ngai a, Saula chun, “Ṭawng inkhâmin, LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ama chu sukhlum ni naw tawp a tih,” a ta."
"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.","Chun, Jonathan chun David chu a ko a, Jonathan chun chuong thil po po chu a hril a. Chun, Jonathan chun David chu Saula kuoma chun a ṭhuoi a, inhma ang bawk khan a kuoma chun a um nâwk tah a."
"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.","Chun, indona a hung um nâwk a, chuongchun, David chu ân thawk suok a, Philistin mihai chu a va thawh a, a va that ṭeu a, a hmaa chun an tlânseh a."
"And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.","Chun, Saula chu a ina fei chawia a ṭhung laiin LALPA tir khawhri a chungah a hung tlung a; chun, David chun ṭingṭang a kei a."
"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.","Chun, Saula chun a fei chun David chu banga khâwde tlat a tum a; nisienlakhawm, Saula kuoma in- thawk chun a fe hmang vat a, fei chu banga chun a khâw bûr ta chut el a; chun, David chu a tlân suok a, chu zân chun a him tah a."
"And Saul sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.","Chun, Saula chun David chu in tienga zîngkâra lo inchâna that dingin mi a tir a; chun, David nuhmei Mikal chun, “Vawizân hin i hringna i humhim naw chun, zînga hin an that ding che a nih,” tiin a hril a."
"So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.","Chuongchun, Mikal chun David chu tukverah a thlâk thla a, chuongchun, a tlân hmang a, a him tah a."
"And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes.","Chun, Mikal chun milim chu a lâk a, khuma chun ân zâltir a; chun, a lu tieng chun kêl hmul lukham a sieh a, puonin ân khum a."
"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.","Chun, David ṭhuoi dinga Saulan mi a hung tir chu, “A dam nawh,” a lo ta."
"And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.","Chun, Saula chun David va en dingin mi a tir a, “A khum pumin hung zâwn suok unla, lo that el ka tih,” a ta."
"And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at the head thereof.","Chun, a mi tirhai chu an va lût chun, ngai ta, khuma chun milim chu a lu tienga kêl hmul lukham khamin a lo um a."
"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?","Saula chun Mikal kuoma chun, “Ieng dinga hienga i mi hlêm a, a himna dinga ka hmêlma chu în suoktir am a na?” a ta."
"Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.","Tûn David chu a tlân hmang a, a him tah a, Rama khuoa Samuel kuomah a va tlung a, a chunga Saula thilthawhai po po chu a hril a. Chun, ama le Samuel chu an feh a, Naiothah an um a."
"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.","Chun, Saula chu, “Ngai ta, David chu Rama khuoa Naiothah a um” ti an hril a."
"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.","Chuongchun, David chu va ṭhuoi dingin Saula chun mitirhai a tir a, chun, zâwlnei ruolin thu an hril duol duol lai le Samuel an chunga hotua um an va hmu chun, Saula mitirhai chunga chun Pathien thlarau a hung tlung a, anni khawm chun thu an hril ve ta duol duol a."
"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.","Chu chu Saula an hang hril chun, mi dang a tir nâwk a, anni khawm chun thu an va hril ve ta duol duol el a."
"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.","Chuongchun, ama khawm chu Rama khuoa chun a fe ve tah a; chun, Seku hmuna tuisunsuo lientak hmun chu a va tlung a, “Samuel le David hi khâwlai am an um a?” tiin ân dawn a. Chun, tuin amani hin, “Ngai ta, Rama khuoa Naiothah an um,” a ta."
"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.","Chuongchun, Rama khuoa Naiotha chun a feh a, chun, Pathien thlarau chu a chunga chun a hung tlung ve tah a, a fe pei a, Rama khuoa Naioth a tlung hmakhat chun thu a hril malam pei a."
"And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?","Chun, ama khawmin a silfênhai a hlîp veh a, Samuel hmaa chun thu a hril ve ta nuk nuk a, chu ni zânkhuo le sûnnithlâk chun ruokin a zâl a. Chuleiin, “Saula khawm chu zâwl- neihai lai a ṭhang ve el am a ni tah?” ti hi an chîng sawng tah a."
"And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in Jehovah; My horn is exalted in Jehovah; My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; Because I rejoice in thy salvation.","Hanna chu a ṭawngṭai a, “LALPA chungah ka lungril a lâwm êm êm a; Ka ki chu LALPAA chawimawiin a um a; Ka hmêlmahai chungah ka bau suklienin a um a, I sandamnaa chun ka lâwm êm êm leiin."
"There is none holy as Jehovah; For there is none besides thee, Neither is there any rock like our God.",LALPA anga inthieng hi an um nawh; Nangma ang hrim an um si nawh; Ei Pathien ang lungpui hrim a um bawk nawh;
"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, And by him actions are weighed.","Chuong ang taka chapo chun thu hril ta naw unla, In baua inthawkin ṭawng chapo hrim hrim suok naw raw se; LALPA chu varna Pathien a ni sih a, Ama chun thilthawhai chu a bûk fie hlak."
The bows of the mighty men are broken; And they that stumbled are girded with strength.,"Mi hrât thalngulhai a sukthliek a, A kathai kâwng chu hrâtnaa khitin a um a,"
"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; And they that were hungry have ceased to hunger: Yea, the barren hath borne seven; And she that hath many children languisheth.","Khawp hlakhai chu fâk ding zawngin an inhlawfa tah a, Phîngṭâm hlakhai chu an phîng a ṭâm ta nawh a; Anih, ching chun pasari a nei tah a, Nau tamtak neinu chu a châu tah,"
"Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive: He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.","LALPA chun a sukhlum hlak a, a sukhring bawk hlak, Thlânah ân fe thlâktir hlak a, a ṭhuoi suok bawk hlak."
"Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich: He bringeth low, he also lifteth up.","LALPA chun a sukpase hlak a, a sukhausa bawk hlak, A suktlâwm hlak a, a chawisâng bawk hlak."
"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s, And he hath set the world upon them.","Pilvuta inthawkin pasie chu a keitho hlak a, Pasie chu êkdûra inthawkin a chawikâng hlak, Mi lienhai kuomah ân umtir theina ding le, Ropuina lalṭhungpha an chang theina dingin, Leihnuoi innghatsan chu LALPA ta a nih; Khawvêl chu a chungah ân nghat ta sih a."
He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail.,"A mi inthieng ke chu vêng a ta, Mi suolhai ruok chu inthim hnuoiah sukdei ṭhapin um an tih; Hrâtna chun tukhawma an ngam âwm si nawh a."
"They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in heaven: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; And he will give strength unto his king, And exalt the horn of his anointed.","LALPA insuolpuihai chu kawinawiin um an ta, Vâna inthawka vâninrûmin do a ta; LALPA chun kâwlkawdawng chenin rorêl a tih; A lal chu hrâtna pêng a ta, A hrieknâl ki chu chawimawi a tih,” a ta."
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.,"Chuongchun, Elkana chu Rama khuoa a ina chun a fe nâwk tah a. Chun, naupang chun thiempu Eli hmaa chun LALPA rawng chu a bâwl tah a."
Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.,"Eli naupasalhai chu Belial nauhai an na, LALPA chu an hriet nawh a."
"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;","Chun, mipuihai laia thiempu- hai thaw dân chu, miin inthâwina an hung inhlân hin, sa suong laitak hin thiempu siehlaw hi sa thurna thîrkut zum thum nei mi chawiin a hung hlak a;"
"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.","chun, bêl bau lien amanih, bêl dâwt nei amanih, bêl khaina nei amanih, bêl amani sûng chu a zuk sun a; chun, chu sa thurna inzumin a hung thur suok po po chu thiempu chun a lâk hlak a nih. Chuong ang chun Israel mihai chutaka hung po pohai chu Silo khuoa chun an lo thawpêk hlak a."
"Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.","Anih, a thâu chu an raw hma chun thiempu siehlaw chu a hung a, ân thâwitu kuoma chun, “Thiempu ta dinga emhmin ding sa mi pe rawh, i sa suong chu a du nawh a, a sel a dit a nih,” a ti hlak a."
"And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “A thâu chu raw phawt el sienla; chun, chu zova chun i hringnain a dit zât zât i lâk ding annâwm,” a lo ti chun, “Ni lo, i mi pêk naw chun la lui hrim hrim ka tih,” a ti hlak a."
And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, tlangvâlhai suol- na chu LALPA mithmuah a lo nasa ta êm êm el a, mihai chun LALPA kuoma inthâwina inhlânhai chu an ngainêp pha ta sih a."
"But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.","Samuel chu naupang ni sien khawm, puon zai inhmi zakawsîng hâkin LALPA hmaah rawng a bâwl a."
"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","Chu naw khawm chu a nuin zakawfuol chîn a ṭhuipêk a, kum tina an inthâwina inhlân dinga a pasal kuoma a fe ve hin a chawipêk hlak a."
"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home.","Chun, Eli chun Elkana le a nu- hmei chu mal a sâwmpêk a, “LALPA ta dinga in thilinhlân in inhlân hi, hi nuhmei thla hin LALPA chun thung raw se cheu,” a ta. Chuongchun, in tieng an fe tah a."
"And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA chun Hanna chu a hung sir a, nau a vawn a, naupasal pathum le naunuhmei pahni a nei a. Chun, naupang Samuel chu LALPA hmaa chun a hung inṭhanglien tah a."
"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.",Eli chu a hung tar ta hle el a; Israel mihai po po chunga a nauhai thilthaw po po le inbiekna puon in kawtkhâr bula rawngbâwltu nuhmei- hai an lo zâlpui hlak thu dâm a lo hriet a.
"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.","Chuongchun, an kuomah, “Iengdinga hieng ang thil hi in thaw am a na? Mi po pohaia inthawk hin in thilthaw ṭha nawhai chu ka lo hriet a nih."
"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.","Ni lo, ka naupasalhai, in chanchin ka lo hriet hi a ṭha naw tieng ruok a nih; LALPA mihai chu in inbawsiettir a nih."
"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.","Mi pakhat mi dang chunga a suol chu Pathienin rorêlpêk a ta, amiruokchu mi, LALPA chungah a suol ruok chun tuin am ngênpui tâng a ta?” a ta. Chuong sa khawm chun an pa râwl chu an ngai nuom nawh a, LALPA chun anni chu a sukhlum ngei ding a ni sih a."
"And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.","Chun, naupang Samuel chu ân ṭhanglien deu deu a, Pathien le mihriemhai dit zâwngin a um tah a."
"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?","Chun, Eli kuoma chun Pathien mi pakhat a hung a, a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Aigupta rama Pharao suoka an um lai khan in thlatu kuoma khan kân lâr a ni naw am a nih?"
"and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?","Chun, Israel hnam po po laia ka mâichâma hang fe a, riminhnik raw a, ka hmaa zakawsîng hâk dingin ka thiempu dingin ama chu ka ruot a ni naw am a nih? I thlatuhai chu Israel mihai pumrawhmang thil inhlân po po ka pêk a ni naw am a nih?"
"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?","Ieng leiin am ka umnaa inhlân dinga ka ruot ka kuoma inthâwina le ka puola thil inhlân chu in sirde a, keia nêka i nauhai i chawimawi lem a, nangni insukthâuna dinga ka mi Israelhai inthâwina a ṭha ṭha in hmang am a na?’ tiin."
"Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.","Chuleiin, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun, ‘Kei chun chu i sûnghai le i pa sûnghai chu kumkhuoin ka hmaah um in tih’ ka ti ngei a; nisienlakhawm, tuhin LALPA chun, ‘Um naw tawp in tih, a mi chawimawi taphawt chu chawimawi ka ta, a mi hmusit taphawt chu ka ngainêp an ni ding a ni sih a."
"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.","Ngai ta, i bân dâm, i pa sûng- hai bân dâm ka tan ni ding chu a hung tlung ding a ni tah; i inah tarkûna dam hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
"And thou shalt behold the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.","Pathienin Israelhai chu hauna a pêk pha chun nang chun ka umnaa tuorna la hmûng i ta; chun, i ina chun kumkhawtluongin tarkûna dam hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
"And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.","Chun, i mi, ka mâichâma inthawka ka sukbohmang naw ding hai chu i mit sukkhamtu le I lungril suknatu nîng an ta; i ina hung pienghai taphawt chu an vânglai takin thi pei an tih."
"And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.","Chun, hi hi, i naupasalhai pahni Hophni le Phinehas chunga thil hung tlung ding chu i ta dingin inchikna nîng a tih; ni khat sûngin an pahniin thi ve vêng an tih."
"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.","Chun, thiempu ringumtak ka ta dingin indin ṭha nâwk ka ta, ama chun chu ka lungril le ka lung tuok- zâwngin thâwng a tih. Chun, sûng- kuo dettakah inngîr ka ta, kum- khuoin ka hriek nâl hmaa chun um a tih."
"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.","Chun, i ina la um po pohai chu tangka le bei hni dingin fêng an ta, ama chibai bûk an tih, bei tlâwmte bêk ka hmu theina dingin thiempu sin mîn thawtir raw khai, tîng an tih,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?","Chun, David chu Rama khuoa Naiotha inthawk chu a tlân a, Jonathan kuoma chun a feh a, “Ieng am ka thaw leh? Ieng am ka bawsiet a? i pa chunga hin ieng am ka suksuol a hienga mi that tum a na?” a ta."
"And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.","Chun, ama chun, “That lo e a, thi naw tawp i tih, ngai ta, ka pa hin mîn hriettir loin, iengkhawm, lien sien chîn sien, a thaw ngai nawh a, ieng- dingin am hieng thu hi ka kuomah ip hlak a ta? ip naw tawp a tih,” a ta."
"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.","Chun, David chun, “I pa chun i mi lunginsiet dân hi a hriet chieng hle el sih a. ‘Jonathan chun hi hi chu hre kher da raw se, chuong naw chun, a lungngai âwm êm el,’ a ti nîng a tih. Amiruokchu, LALPA hringna le i hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, thina le kan inkâr chu pên khat chau a nih,” tiin a hril uor nâwk a."
"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “I hringnain a dit ang taphawt chun thawpêk pei ka ti che,” a ta."
"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.","David chun Jonathan kuomah, “Ngai ta, zinga hin thla thar a ni ding a na, lal kuoma thlaithlêng awt ngei ding ka na, nisienlakhawm, a ni thum ni zântieng chenin phûl tieng inbi- hmang dingin fe lem ka tih."
"If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.","I pa chun ka um naw hi hung hre suok a ni hlau chun, ‘David chun a khuo Bethlehema va fe vak dingin a mi hni a mi hnih a, an sûngkaw ta dinga an kum tin inthâwi hun a na,’ lo ti la."
"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.","‘A ṭha chu,’ a ti chun, i siehlaw chu a lung muong a ta, amiruokchu, a lung a sen chun thil ṭha naw thaw a tum a nih ti hre el rawh."
"Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?","Chuleiin, i siehlaw hi ṭhatakin thaw la, i siehlaw chu LALPA thu- thlungah i lûtpui ta sih a; amiruok- chu, bawsietna nei ka ni chun nangin mi that law law el rawh, iengdingin am i pa kuoma chun mi ṭhuoi kher kher i ta?” a ta."
"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?","Chun, Jonathan chun, “That lo e a, i chunga thil ṭha naw thaw ka pain a tum ka hriet phawt chun ka hril naw ding che am a nih?” a ta."
"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?","Chuongchun, David chun Jona- than kuomah, “I pa hin inrawmtakin dawn ta ang sienla che, tuin am mi hril a ta?” a ta."
"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.","Chun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “Hung ta, va fêng ei tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, phûla chun an va fe rêl tah a."
"And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, be witness: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?","Chun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu hretu ni raw se, zîngah hieng tik pha hin amanih, ni thum nia manih, ka pa ka hung dâwp pha, ngai ta, David chungchâng thu hi ṭha tieng a ni chun mi hung tirin ka hril el naw ding che?"
"Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.","Chun, ka pain i chungah thil ṭha naw thaw nuom ta sienla, ka hril naw cheh a, lungmuongtaka i fe theina dinga kân thla naw che chun, LALPAIN Jonathan chu a thaw thawin thaw sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin; chun, LALPA chu i kuom- ah um raw se, ka pa kuoma a um hlak angin."
"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;","Chun, ka thi nawna dingin ka dam sûng chaua LALPA lunginsietna mîn hmutir ni loin,"
"but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.","kumkhawtluongin ka sûnghai chunga khawm i lunginsietna chu bo naw raw se; LALPAIN David hmêlma hnuoi chunga a sukbo vawng hnung chen khawmin ma naw rawh,” a ta."
"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.","Jonathan chun, “David hmêl- mahaia inthawkin LALPA chun phût a tih,” tiin David sûnghai kuoma chun thu a thlung a."
"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.","Chun, Jonathan chun ama a hmangaina sâlin David kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm nâwk a, ama hring- na a hmangai ang chiein a hmangai sih a."
"Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun a kuomah, “Zinga hin thla thar a ni ding a na, i ṭhungna hmun a ruok ding leiin i um naw chu inlang ngei ding a na."
"And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.","Ni thum i um hnung chun fe thla vat la, kha hmaa thil a hung um laia în bîkna hmuna khan hung la, Ezel lung bula chun um zing rawh."
"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.","Chun, inthemthiem ni âwmtak- in a sîrah thal pathum hung kâp ka ta."
"And, behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.","Chun, ngai ta, ‘Fe la, thalhai kha va zawng hmu rawh,’ tiin nau- pang tir ka ta.

"But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.","Amiruokchu, naupang kuoma chun, ‘En ta, thalhai chu i khêltienga saw a um,’ ka ti chun, fe hmang el rawh; LALPA chun ân fe hmangtir che ning a tih."
"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.","Chun, nang le keiin thil ei hril tahai chungchâng thua chun ngai ta, nang le ei inkâra chun LALPA chu a um kumkhuo a nih,” a ta."
"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.","Chuongchun, David chu phûla chun ân bihmang a, chun, thla a hung thar chun lal chu thlaithlêng awtin a ṭhung a."
"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.","Lal chu ni danga a ṭhungna pângngai bang kâwla a ṭhungnaa chun a ṭhung a; chun, Jonathan chu a ngîr a; chun, Abner chu Saula kâwla chun a ṭhung a; David hmun ruok kha chu a ruok a."
"Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.","Amiruokchu, Saula chun chu ni chun iengkhawm a hril nawh a, “A chungah thil ieng am a nih a um a, ân thieng naw amanih ning a ta, a thieng naw ni ngei a tih,” a ti lungril a."
"And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?","Chun, thla thar a ni hni ni chun David hmun chu a la ruok ta rawp a; chuongchun, Saula chun a naupa Jonathan kuomah, “Iengdinga Jesai naupa hi zâni le vawisûn hin thlai- thlêng awt dinga hung naw am a na?” a ta."
"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:","Jonathan chun Saula chu a dawn a, “David chun Bethlehema fe dingin a mi hni a mi hni a."
"and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table.","‘Mîn fetir hrâm rawh khai, kan sûngkuo chun khuoa chun inthâwina an nei ding a na, ka unaupa chun um ve dingin a mîn cha tlat a; chuong- chun, i mi lunginsiet thei chun mîn fetir la, ka unauhai va sir ka tih,’ a ta. Chu lei chun lal dawkâna chun a hung naw a nih,” a ta."
"Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?","Chuongchun, Jonathan chung- ah Saula lung chu a sen ta thut el a, “Nang nuhmei lepchie le kâwmaw naupa, Jesai naupa chu i muolphona dingin le i nu saruokna sukmuol- phona dingin i thlang ti ka hriet naw am a nih?"
"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.","Jesai naupa hi, hi hnuoia a um sûng phawt chun sukdet ni naw ti nih a, i ram khawm. Chuleiin, inkotir nghâl la, ka kuomah hung inṭhuoitir rawh, a thi ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?","Chun, Jonathan chun a pa Saula chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ieng- dingin am sukhlum ding nîng a ta? Ieng am a thaw hrim leh?” a ta."
And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death.,Saula chun khaw tumin a fei chu a hang inlet a; chu chu lei chun Jonathan chun a pain David chu that a lo tum ngei a ni ti a hriet tah a.
"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.","Chun, Jonathan chu dawkâna inthawk chun lunginsentakin a tho a, chu thla ni hni ni chun thlaithlêng a awt ve ta nawh a, a pa chun David a sukmuolpho êm lei chun a lung- ngaipui a nih."
"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.","Chun, zîngkâr chun Jonathan chu naupangte chu ṭhuoiin David le an hmun ruot phûl tieng chun a fe tah a."
"And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.","Chun, a naupang kuoma chun, “Tlân la, ka thal kâphai hi va zawng raw khai,” a ta. Chun, naupang chu a tlân lai chun a khêl tieng chun thal chu a kâp a."
"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?","Chun, naupang chun Jonathan thal kâp tlâkna hmun a va tlung chun Jonathan chun naupang chu a ko a, “Thal chu i khêl tienga saw a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.","Chun, Jonathan chun nau- pangte chu a ko a, “Hung tlân vak rawh, inhmaw rawh, muong naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, Jonathan nau- pang chun thal chu a rût khâwm a, a pu kuom tienga chun a fe tah a."
But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.,"Nisienlakhawm, naupang chun iengkhawm a hriet naw a, Jonathan le David chau chun thil umzie chu an hriet a."
"And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.","Chun, Jonathan chun a hriem- hreihai chu naupang chu a pêk a, a kuomah, “Fe la, khuoah lo hang fepui rawh,” a ta."
"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.","Chun, naupang chu a fe phingle chun David chu a umna hmun sim- tieng panga inthawk chun a hung tho a, hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai vawi thum a bûk a, chun, an infâwp a, an ṭap rêl a. David ruok chu a zuol bîk a."
"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.","Chun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin fe raw khai, ‘LALPA chu nang le ei inkâra le ka thlahai le i thlahai kâra chun kumkhuoin um raw se,’ tiin LALPA hmingin ṭawng ei inkhâm hmunkhat ta kha,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho a, a fe tah a, chun, Jonathan chu khuoa chun a lût tah a."
"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?","Chuongchun, David chu Nob khuoa thiempu Ahimelek kuoma chun a feh a, chun, Ahimelek chun inthin pumin David chu a lo tuok a, a kuomah, “Iengtizie am a na, i va mal de, fe pui i nei nawh a?” a lo tih a."
"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.","David chun, thiempu Ahimelek kuoma chun, “Lalin thil thaw dingin thu a mi pêk a, ka kuomah, ‘Ka thil inthawtir tum che le ka thupêk hrim hrim che hi tukhawma hre naw raw se,’ a ti tlat a; chun, tlangvâlhai lo umna ding hmunhai chu ka ruot a."
"Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.","Chuongchun, ieng ieng am i kutah a um a? Bei tlang nga mi pe la, annawleh, i nei ang taphawt khawm chu,” a ta."
"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.","Chun, thiempu chun David chu a dawn a, “Bei narân chu ka nei nawh a, bei inthieng ruok chu ka nei a; tlangvâlhai chu nuhmeia inthawka an insiekieng phawt chun,” a ta."
"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?","Chun, David chun thiempu chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “Tuta ni thum sûng hin chu nuhmeia inthawk hrim hrim chu kan insiekieng vawng a nih, ka hung suok ding lai khawm khan tlangvâlhai bûrlebêl chu ân thieng a nih, invâk satlie el kan ni nâka chu; vawisûn lem chu chu an bûrlebêlhai chu a vân thieng nâwkzuol awm de e!” a ta."
"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.","Chuongchun, thiempu chun, bei inthieng chu a pêk tah a; chutaka chun entirna bei an lâk nia bei luma thleng dinga LALPA hmaa inthawka an lâk chau naw chu bei dang a um si nawh a."
"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.","Chun, chu ni chun Saula siehlaw laia mi pakhat LALPA hmaa hrên a um a, a hming chu Doeg a nih, Edom mi, Saula ran vêngtuhai laia hotu tak a nih."
"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.","Chun, David chun Ahimelek kuoma chun, “Fei amanih, kâwlhnâm amanih i kawl naw maw? Lal hmaa chun inhmaw a ṭûl leiin ka kâwlhnâm le ka hriemhrei a ieng khawm ka hung chawi hman naw a nih,” a ta."
"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.","Chun, thiempu chun, “Philistin mi Goliath, Ela ruoma i thatpa kâwlhnâm chu ngai ta, thiempu zakawsîng hliea sawn puona tuomin a um zing el, chu chu i lâk nuom chun la rawh; chu chau naw chu a dang a um nawh,” a ta. David chun, “Chu bâk chu ie, mi pe raw khai,” a ta."
"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.","Chun, David chu a tho a, chu ni chun Saula ṭi chun a tlân hmang a, Gath lal Akis kuomah a fe tah a."
"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?","Chun, Akis siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Hi hi an ram lal David a ni naw am a ni kha? ‘Saulain a sânga sâng a that a, Davidin a sînga sîng a that a,’ tiha lâm pumin a chungchâng thu hlain an sak dur dur a ni naw am a ni kha?” an ta."
"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.","Chun, David chun chuong thuhai chu a lungrilah a pai tah a, Gath lal Akis chu a ṭi ta hle el a."
"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.","Chuongchun, a hmaa chun a um dân a sukdanglam a, an mithmua chun invêt tehlêm a thaw ta rak el a, kawtkhâr dâm chu a kei rak rak a, a khâkhmula dâm chun a chil a sukluong ta neng nung a."
"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?","Chuongchun, Akis chun a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “En ta u, invêt a ni in hriet zing sih a, iengdinga ka kuoma in hung ṭhuoi am a na?"
"Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?",Invêt ka tlâksam leiin am a nih hi mi hi ân vêtzie suklang dinga ka hmaa in hung ṭhuoi chu? Ama hi ka inah a hung lût el ding maw?” a ta.
"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.","Chuongchun, David chu chutaka inthawk chu a suok a, Adullam pûkah a tlân tah a; chun, a unauhai le a pa sûngkuohai po poin an lo hriet chun chutaka chun a kuomah an zu feh a."
"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.","Chun, mi lunginzing taphawthai, leibat nei taphawthai, lungninawna nei taphawthai chu a kuomah an fe khâwm a; chuongchun, an hotuah a um tah a, chun a kuoma chun mi za li lai an um tah a."
"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.","Chun, David chu chutaka inthawk chun Moab rama Mizpe-ah a feh a, Moab lal kuoma chun, “Pathien thil mi thawpêk ding ka hriet hmakhat chu ka nu le ka pa hung hai sien, i kuomah lo um raw hai se, ka hni che a nih,” a ta."
And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.,"Chun, Moab lal hmaa chun anni chu a hung ṭhuoi a, kulbînga a um sûng po chun a kuoma chun an um tah a."
"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.","Chun, zâwlnei Gad chun David kuomah, “Kulbînga hin um zing naw rawh, suok la, Judai ramah fe rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chu a suok a, Hereth ramhnuoia chun a lût tah a."
"And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.","Chun, Saula chun David le a kuoma umhai chu an hmu tah ti a lo hriet a, Saula chu Gibeaah Rama khuoa tamarisk thing hnuoiah a fei chawiin a ṭhung a; chun, a vêla chun a siehlawhai po po chu an ngîr a."
"And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,","Chun, Saula chun a kâwl vêla ngîr a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Nangni Benjamin thlahai lo ngai unla, Jesai naupa chun lohai, grêp huonhai pe seng cheuin, a sipai sâng hotuahai, a sipai za hotuahai a siem vawng ding cheu am a nih?"
"that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?","in rêngin in mi enbing a, ka naupain Jesai naupa kuoma thu a ithlung ka kuoma suklang hrim hrim in um nawh a, a mi lungngaipui hrim hrim khawm in um nawh a, ka naupain ka siehlaw hi mi do ding le vawisûn ni chen khawma min chân dinga ân fui thu ka kuoma suklang hrim iengdinga in um naw?” a ta."
"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.","Chuongchun, Saula siehlawhai kâwla ngîr Edom mi Doeg chun a dawn a, “Jesai naupa chu Nob khuoa Ahitub naupa Ahimelek kuoma a hung ka hmuh a."
"And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.","Chun, ama chun LALPA a rawnpêk a, fâk ding a pêk a; chun, Philistin mi Goliath kâwlhnâm a pêk bawk a,” a ta."
"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.","Chuongchun, lal chun Ahitub naupa Ahimelek thiempu le, a pa sûngkuo Nob khuoa thiempu um po po chu ân kotir a; anni chu an rêngin lal kuoma chun an hung a."
"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.","Chun, Saula chun, “Nang Ahitub naupa, lo ngai rawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka lalpa, hitaka hin ka um,” a ta."
"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?","Chun, Saulain a kuomah, “Bei le kâwlhnâm dâm lo pe a, LALPA chu rawnpêkin vawisûn nia a thaw anga mi do ding le min chân dinga ieng- dinga nang le Jesai naupa hin in mi phierrûk am a na?” a ta."
"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?","Chuongchun, Ahimelek chun lal chu a dawn a, “Lal mâkpa, i mi rawntak hlak, in sûngkuo laia mi inzaum David ang hrim hrima mi ringum hi i siehlaw po pohai lai hin tu am a um a?"
"Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.","Vawisûn hi Pathien ka biek râwnpêk ṭan ni am a nih?

"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.","Chun, lal chun, “Ahimelek, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih, nang le i pa sûngkuohai po po leh,” a ta."
"And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.","Chun, lal chun a kâwla ngîr sipai kuoma chun, “Nghakîr unla, LALPA thiempuhai hi that ro, David tieng an ṭhang a, a tlân hmang a nih ti hre zing siin ka kuoma an hril naw leiin,” a ta.

"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.","Chun, lal chun Doeg kuoma chun, “Nang nghakîr la, thiempuhai kha thaw rawh,” a ta.

"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.","Chun, Nob, thiempu khuo chu kâwlhnâmin a thawh a, a nuhmei a pasalin naupang le nênê ne lai chen- in, bâwnghai, sabengtunghai, berâm- hai leh kâwlhnâmin a sât hlum a."
"And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.","Chun, Ahitub naupa Ahimelek naupasalhai laia pakhat a hming Abiathar chu a tlân suok a, David kuomah a tlân a."
And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovah’s priests.,"Chun, Abiathar chun Saulain LALPA thiempuhai a that thu chu David a hril a."
"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father’s house.","David chun Abiathar kuoma chun, “Edom mi Doeg chutaka a um ni ngei khan Saula hril ngei ngei a tih ti ka hriet sa hrim a nih; I pa sûng- kuohai po po chu keia leia thi an nih."

"And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.","Chun, “Ngai ta, Philistin mihai chun Keila khuo an thawh a, hrizâwla buhai chu an lâkpêk vawng el,” tiin David chu an hril a."
"Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.","Chuongchun, David chun LALPA chu, “Chuong Philistin mihai chu ka zu thaw ding am a nih?” tiin a râwn a.

"And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?","Chun, David mihai chun a kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, Judai rama um zing khawm hin ei ṭi a na, Keila khuoa zu feh a, Philistin sipaihai zu do chu ṭi a va um nâwkzuol âwm de!” an ta."
"Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.","Chuongchun, David chun LALPA chu a râwn nâwk tah a.

"And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai chu Keila khuoa chun an zu fe tah a, Philistin mihai chu an zu thawh a, an ranhai chu an lâkpêk a, an that ṭeu a.

"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.","Chun, Ahimelek naupa Abiathar Keila khuoa David kuoma a tlân lai khan thiempu zakawsîng chawia fe thla a na."
"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.

"And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.","Chun, Saula chun mi po po chu indo dingin, Keila khuoa chun zu fe a, David le a mihai zûn huol dingin a ko khâwm a."

"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant.

"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go.

And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.,"Chun, David chun ama suk- hlum tumin Saula chu a hung inthawk ti a hriet a; chuongchun, David chu Ziph thlalêr Horeshah a um a."
"And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.","Chun, Saula naupa Jonathan chu a tho a, Horeshah David kuoma chun a feh a. Pathienah a kut chu a sukhrâtpêk a."
"And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.","Chun, a kuomah, “Ṭi dêr naw rawh, ka pa Saula kut chun zawng suok naw ni che; Israelhai lalah um i ta, kei nanga dawt nîng ka tih, chu khawm chu ka pa Saula hin a hriet zing a nih,” a ta.

"And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.",David chu Horesha chun a um zing a; Jonathan ruok chu in tieng a fe tah a.
"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?","Chuongchun, Ziph mihai chu Gibea-ah Saula kuomah an hang feh a, “David chu kan kuomah Horesha kulbîngah, thlalêr simtieng pang Hakila tlângah ân bihmang zing a ni naw am a nih?"
"Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.","Chuleiin, aw lalpa, i hringnain hung thlâk a duthusâm ang ngei chun hung thla ta la, chun, keini lo thaw ve ding chu lal kuta ama lo inhlân chu nîng a ta,” an ta."
"And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me.","Chun, Saula chun, “LALPA chun malsâwm raw se cheu; nangni chun chu in mi lunginsiet hle a ni hi."
"Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.","Fe unla, va sukchieng nâwkzuol unla, a hnung le hma va sui unla, chutaka a hmutu khawm va sukfel nâwkzuol zet zet ro: var vervêktakin thil a thaw hlak a nih ti miin an mi hril a nih."
"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.","Chuleiin, ân bîkhmangna hmun po pohai hre vawng bak unla, chun, ka kuomah hung nâwk ngei ngei unla: chun, nangni leh ka fe ve ding a nih: chun, hi ramah a um phawt chun Juda mi sâng tamtak laia inthawk chun zawng suok ka tih,” a ta."
"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.","Chun, an tho a, Saula fe hmain Zipha chun an fe tah a, nisienla- khawm, David le a mihai chu Jeshi- mon simtieng Arabaah Maon thla- lêra chun an um a."
"And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.","Chun, Saula le a mihai chu ama zawng dingin an feh a. Chun, David chu an hril a, chuongchun, Maon thlalêra um lungpui pan ding chun a suok a. Saulân chu chu a hriet chun Maon thlalêra chun David chu a hnawt tah a."
"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.","Saula chu tlâng khingtieng pangah a feh a, David le a mihai chu tlâng khingtieng panga chun an feh a, chun, David chu Saula ṭi chun inhmâwtakin a tlân a; Saula le a mihai chun David le a mihai chu man tumin an inhuol vêl sih a."
"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.","Nisienlakhawm, Saula kuoma chun, “Inhmaw la, hung rawh, Philistin mihai chun ei ram an hung thaw a nih,” tiin thangko a hung tlung a."
"So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.","Chuongchun, Saula chun David a hnawt lai chu a kîrsan a, Philistin mihai do ding chun a fe tah a: chuleiin, chu hmun chu Sela-hama- hlekoth an ti tah a."
"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.","Chun, David chu chutaka in- thawk chu a feh a. En-gedi kul- bîngahai chun a hang um tah a."
"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.","Chun, Saula chu Philistin mihai a va hnawt a hung chun, “Ngai ta, David chu En-gedi thlalêrah a um,” tiin an hril a."
"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.","Chuongchun, Saula chun Israel mi po pohai laia thlang ṭhieu mi sâng thum a ṭhuoi a, sakêlhai umna lungpui laia chun David le a mihai zawng dingin a fe tah a."
"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.","Chun, lam kârlaka chun berâm huon umna pûk hi a va tlung a; chun, Saula chu inthier fihlîm dingin a va lût a. Chun, David le a mihai chu pûk sûngril tieng chun an um a."
"And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.","Chun, David mihai chun a kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, LALPAIN i kuomah, ‘Ngai ta, i hmêlma chu i kutah pêng ka ta, a chungah ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,’ a ti ni kha a ni ta hi,” an ta. Chuongchun, David chu a tho a, inrûkin Saula puon hmawr chu a va ât thlâk a."
"And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.","Chun, Saula puon hmawr a va ât thlâk chun David lungril chu a sukna hleh a."
"And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed.","Chuongchun, a mihai kuoma chun, “LALPA hrieknâl a nih ti hre zing sih a, a chunga kut thlâk a, LALPA hrieknâl ka lalpa chunga hi thil ka thaw hi a âwm naw tawp el a,” a ta."
"So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.","Chuongchun, David chun chuong thuhai chun a mihai chu a khap a, Saula thaw dinga an suok chu a phal ta nawh a. Chun, Saula chu pûka inthawk chun a suok a, a fe tah a."
"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.","A hnung ela chun David khawm chu a tho a, pûka inthawk chun a suok a, “Lalpa, ka lalpa,” tiin Saula chu a ko zui a. Chun, Saula chu a nghakîr chun, David chun a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a."
"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?","Chun, David chun Saula kuomah, “Ngai ta, ‘David hin i sietna ding a zawng a nih,’ tiha mihaiin i kuoma an hril chu iengdinga i awi hlak am a na?"
"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah’s anointed.","Ngai ta, vawisûn hin LALPAIN pûka hin ka kuta a hung inhlânzie che hi i mit ngeiin i hmuh a; ṭhenkhat chun sukhlum ding chein an mi tir a; nisienlakhawm, ka hla cheh a; ka lalpa chunga hin ka kut hrim hrim inlet naw ning, LALPA hrieknâl a ni sih a, ka tih a."
"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it.","Chu chau khawm chu ni loin, pa, en ta, hi i puon hmawr khawm ka chawi zing hi: i puon hmawr ka ât thlâk thei siha, ka sukhlum nawna chea hin ka kuta hin thil ṭha naw le bawsietna a um nawh ti le, ka hringna lâk tumin mi zawng la khawm, i chunga hin ka suol naw a nih ti hi hre zing ngei ngei raw khai."
"Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.","LALPA chun nang le keia chungthu hi rêl raw se; chun, LALPA chun i chungah phuba mi lapêk raw se; nisienlakhawm, kei chun chu i chungah kut thlâk naw hrim hrim ka tih."
"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.","Tienlai mihai thuvarin, ‘Mi suola inthawkin suol a hung suok hlak a,’ a tih a, nisienlakhawm, i chungah kut thlâk naw ning,"
"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.","Israel lal hi tu zawnga hung suok am a na? Tu am a na i hnawt? Ui pûl thi, uihrik el."
"Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.","Chuleiin, LALPA chu rorêltu ni sienla, nang le keia chungthu hi sukthlu sienla, mi ngaituopêkin mi hrilpui sien la, i kuta inthawk hin mi sansuok raw se,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.","Chun, Davidin Saula kuoma hieng thu hi a hril zo chun Saula chun, “Hi hi i râwl a ni maw, ka naupa David?” a ta. Chun, Saula chu râwl insuo meuin a ṭap tah a."
"And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.","David kuoma chun, “Keia nêk chun i fel lem êm êm a nih, nang chun chu ka chungah thil ṭha i thawh a, kei ruok chun chu thil ṭha naw ka thaw a nih."
"And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not.","Chun, vawisûn hin ka chunga thil ṭha i thawzie i suklang tah a nih; LALPAIN i kuta a mi pêk sa khawma i mi sukhlum nawa hin."
"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day.","Miin a hmêlma hmu ang sienla, tlangtakin ân suo nuom ding am a nih? Chuleiin, vawisûna ka chunga i thilthawa hin LALPAIN thil ṭhain thung raw se che."
"And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.","Ngai ta, lal i la ni ngei ding a na, Israel ram chu i kutah sukdetin a um ding a ni ti ka hriet tah."
"Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.","Chuleiin, keia hnunga ka thla- hai la hung um dinghai chu sukbo- hmang naw ding le, ka pa sûngkuo laia inthawka ka hming sukbo lo dingin LALPA hmingin ka kuomah ṭawng inkhâm raw khai,” a ta."
And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the stronghold.,"Chuongchun, David chun Saula kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm tah a. Chun, Saula chu a fe tah a, David le a mihai ruok chu kulbînga chun an hang fe tah a."
"And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.","Chun, Samuel chu a thi tah a; chun, Israel mihai po po chu an inko khâwm a, an ṭah a; Rama khuoa a ina chun an phûm tah a. Chun, David chu a tho a, Paran thlalêrah a zu feh a."
"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.","Chun, Maon khuoa chun mi pakhat a um a, a khawsakna chu Karmel tlângah a nih, mi ropuitak a na, berâm sâng thum le kêl sâng khat a nei a, Karmel tlânga chun a berâm hmul a vawh a."
"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.","Chu mipa hming chu Nabal a nih; a nuhmei hming chu Abigail a nih, chu nuhmei chu bengvârtak, hmêl- ṭhatak a na; a pasal ruok chu mi biek intaktak le mi rilotak a nih; Kaleb thla a nih."
And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.,"Chun, David chun thlalêra in- thawk chun Nabal chun a berâm hmul a vaw ti a lo hriet a."
"And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:","Chuongchun, Davidin tlangvâl sâwm a tir a, tlangvâlhai kuoma chun, Davidin, “Karmel tlânga chun hang fe unla, Nabal kuoma chun hang fe unla, keia hmingin chibai hang bûk ro;"
"and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.","chun, mi neinungtakpa kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril ro, ‘I chunga dâm, i sûngkuohai chunga dâm, i nei po po chunga dâm, lungmuongna um raw se."
"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.","I berâm hmul vâwtuhai an um ti ka hriet a; I berâm vêngtuhai chu ka kuoma hin an um hlak a, an pawi iengkhawm kan tâwk nawh a, Karmel tlânga an um sûng hrim hrim hin iengkhawm an chân nawh."
"Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.","I tlangvâlhai indawn la hril el an ti che; chuleiin, tlangvâlhai hi lo lunginsiet rawh, a remchâng ni takin kan hung tlung a ni hi; i nei ang ang chu i siehlawhai le i naupa David hi lo pe ta, a tih a,’ va ti ro,” a ta."
"And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.","Chun, David tlangvâlhai chu an va tlung chun, David hming chun chuong thu po po chu Nabal kuoma chun an hril a, chun, to zingin an nghâk a."
"And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.","Chun, Nabal chun David sie- hlawhai chu a dawn a, “David chu tu am a ni leh? Jesai naupa chu tu am a ni leh? Tulai hin siehlaw tamtak puhai tlân hmangsan an tam el a."
"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?","Ka bei dâm, ka tui dâm, le ka berâm hmul vâwtuhai ta dinga ka that sa hi tuhai am an ni khawm hriet hlei lo mihai chu ka pêk hlak ding am a nih?” a ta."
"So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.","Chuongchun, David tlangvâl- hai chu an lêt nâwk a, an kîr nâwk a; chuong thu po po chu an hung hril a."
"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.","Chun, David chun a mihai kuoma chun, “In kâwlhnâm pai seng ro,” a ta. Chun, an kâwlhnâm chu an pai seng a, David khawm chun a kâwlhnâm chu a pai a; mi za li laiin David chu an hang zui a; chun, mi za hni chu thuomhnaw nghâkin an um a."
"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.","Chun, tlangvâl pakhat chun Na- bal nuhmei Abigail kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, David chun thlalêra inthawkin kan pu hi chibai bûk dingin mihai a hungtir a, ama chun a lo hal a."
"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:","Nisienlakhawm, anni chu kan chungah an ṭha hle el a, kan pawi iengkhawm an tâwk nawh a, phûla kan uma kan um hmunkhat sûng po po khan iengkhawm kan inhmang nawh a;"
"they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.",berâm vênga an kuoma kan um sûng po po chun sûn le zân kan ta dinga kul an ni ringawt el a.
"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.","Chuleiin, ieng am a na i thaw ding, nguntakin ngaituo ta khai, kan pu sûngkuo le ama chunga hin thil ṭha naw thaw tumna a um a nih; ama hlak hi Belial naupa a ni ringawt el a, tu ibiek thei khawm a ni si nawh a,” a ta."
"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.","Chun, Abigail chun inhmâwtak- in, bei tlang za hni le uoin peng hni leh, berâm panga suong el dinga inzo sa hieu leh, beiphit bûk nga leh, grêp ra em ṭâwl bâwr za leh, theichang hlawm za hni leh a lâkkhâwm a, sabengtung ân phurtir a."
"And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.","Chun, a siehlaw tlangvâlhai kuoma chun, “Ka hmaah lo fe pei unla, ngai ta u, hung zui ka ti cheu,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, a pasal Nabal chu a hril nawh a."
"And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.","Chuongchun, a sabengtung chunga chun a chuong a, tlâng kâr- kawta a ṭum laiin ngai ta, David le a mihai chun an hung pan a; chuong- chun, an intuok tah a."
"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.","David chun, “A iengkhawm, ân hmang nawna dingin hi mipa nei hi thlalêrah a thlâwn ela vêngpêk ka lo ni hi tie; thil ṭha chu thil ṭha nawin a mi thung el ta sih a."
"God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.","Zingah zîng khawvar chena a ta po po laia pasal naupang pakhat chau hringna khawm ka hla a ni chun Pathienin David chu a thaw thawin thaw raw se, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” a ti ta sih a."
"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.","Chun, Abigail chun David a hmu chun a sabengtunga inthawk chun a ṭum vat a, David hmaa chun a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a."
"And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.","Chun, a ke bula chun a bawk- khup a, “Keimân, pu, keima ngeiin khawhlona chu phur el ka tih, chun, i siehlawnu hin i na hrietah thu hril sienla, i siehlawnu thuhril chu ngai dingin ka hni che a nih."
"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.","Ka hni che, ka lalpa hin Belial mi Nabal chu ienga khawm ngai naw raw khai, a hming ang chie el hi a ni hrim a nih, Nabal an ti namân, ân vêt a ni hi, kei i siehlawnu hin ka pu tlangvâl hungtirhai kha chu ka lo hmu naw a nih."
"Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.","Chuleiin, tuhin pu Lalpa hring- na le i hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ka lo hmu naw takzet a nih, LALPAIN thisen insuo lo ding le i kuta phuba la lo dingin a siem si cheh a, i hmêl- mahai le ka pu ṭhat nawna zawng- tuhai chu Nabal ang ni el raw se."
"And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.","Chun, hi ka pu ta dinga i siehlawin lâwmman ka hung chawi hi ka pu hung zuitu tlangvâlhai hi pêk ni raw se."
"Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.","Ka hni che a nih, i siehlawnu suolna hi ngaidam rawh, LALPA chun ka pu hi sûngkuo nghettakah indin ngei ngei a ta, ka pu hi LALPA indonahai do a ni sih a; i dam sûng po po chun nangmaa chun suolna hrim hrim hmu ding um naw nih."
"And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.","Nangma hnawt ding che le i hringna sukbo dingin mihai hung in- thawk hai sien khawm, ka pu hringna chu LALPA i Pathien le hringna intêl laia intêl nîng a ta; i hmêlmahai hringna ruok chu vailungdêng phana dêng angin dêng hmang dai a tih."
"And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,","Chun, LALPAIN i chungchâng thua thil ṭha tiem ang po ka pu chunga hin a thaw phaa Israelhai lala a siem pha che chun,"
"that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.","a san um loa thisen insuo loa, ka pu chun phuba i lâk bawk naw hi i ta ding chun lungngaina hrim hrim ni naw nih a, ka pu ta dingin lung ninawna hrim hrim ni naw nih a; chun, LALPAIN ka lalpa chunga hin thil ṭha a thaw pha chun i siehlawnu hi hre zing rawh aw,” a ta."
"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:","Chun, David chun Abigail kuoma chun, “Vawisûna mi tuok dinga hung tirtu che LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se;"
"and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.","chun, i remhrietna chu mal- sâwmin um sienla, chun, nang thisen insuo thiemnawnaa inthawka mi humtu le keima kuta phuba la loa mi siemtu chu malsâwmin um bawk rawh."
"For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.","Nangin mi lo tuok vak naw la chu, LALPA Israelhai Pathien hring- na sâlin ka hril a, zînga khawvar chen chun Nabal chu naupang pa- khat chau khawm hlapêk naw tawp ka tih,” a ta."
"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.","Chuongchun, David chun a thil hung chawipêkhai chu a lâk a; chun, a kuoma chun, “Lungmuongtakin, in tieng hang fe ta la, chun, i thu chu ka awi a, i hni chu ka pawmpêk che a nih aw,” a ta."
"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.","Chun, Abigail chu Nabal kuoma chun a hang feh a; chun, ngai ta, a ina chun lal ruoiṭhe ang elin ruoi a lo ṭheh a, ân rui hle leiin Nabal chu a hlim huom el a; chuleiin, a zîng khawvar hmakhat chun iengkhawm, a hril nawh a."
"And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.","Chun, zîngtienga Nabal uoin inrui chu a hung har chun a nuhmei chun chuong thu chu a hang hril a, a lungril chu a mit ta sul a, lung ang elin a hung um tah a."
"And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.","Chun, ni sâwm hnunga chun LALPAIN Nabal chunga chun kut a thlâk a, a thi tah a."
"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.","Chun, Davidin Nabal chu a thi ti a hang hriet chun, “Ka hming sietna dingin Nabal thilthawa mi hrilpuia, a siehlaw chu thil ṭha naw chu thaw lo dinga mi khaptu LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se; Nabal thil ṭha naw thaw chu LALPAIN ama chung ngeiah ân tlâktir tah a nih,” a ta.

"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.","Chun, David siehlawhai chun Karmel tlânga Abigail kuom an va tlung chun, “David chun a nuhmei dinga ṭhuoi ding chein a mi tir a nih,” tiin an biek a."
"And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.","Chun, a tho a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a; “Ngai ta u, in siehlawnu hi ka lalpa siehlawhai ke sâwp dinga siehlaw ka nih,” a ta."
"And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.","Chuongchun, Abigail chu a tho vak a, sabengtung chungah a chuong a, a hnungzui nunghâk pangahai le chun David mi tirhai chu an zui tah a, a nuhmeiah a um tah a."
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.,"David chun Jezreela mi Ahinoam a lo nei ta bawk a; chuong- chun, a nuhmeia chun an um ve ve tah a."
"Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.",Saula chun a naunu Mikal David nuhmei kha Gallim khuoa Lais naupa Palti a lo inneitir tah a nih.
"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?","Chun, Ziph mihai chu Gibeaa Saula kuomah an feh a, “David chu Jeshimon dep Hakila tlânga chun ân bihmang a ni naw am a nih?” tiin an va hril a."
"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.","Chuongchun, Saula chu a tho a, Ziph thlalêra chun Israel mihai laia thlang ṭhieu mi sâng thum ṭhuoiin Ziph thlalêra chun David zawng dingin a zu fe tah a."
"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.","Chun, Saula chun Jeshimon dep, lam palailaka chun Hakila tlânga chun ṭhanghmun a khuor a. David ruok chu thlalêra chun a um zing a; chun, Saula chu ama zawng dingin thlalêra chun a hung ti a hriet a."
"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.","Chuleiin, David chun enthlit- tuhai a tir a, Saula chu a hung tak tak a nih ti a hriet chieng tah a."
"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.","Chuongchun, David chu a tho a, Saula ṭhanghmun khuornaa chun a feh a, chun David chun Saula le a sipai hotu Abner, Nera naupa zâlna chu a hmuh a; Saula chu tawlailîr huol sûnga chun a zâl a, a vêlin mihai chun umhmun an rem a."
"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.","Chuongchun, David chun Hit mi Ahimelek le Joab unau Zeruia naupa Abisai kuomah, “Saula ṭhanghmuna chun kei leh tu am fêng a ta?” a ta. Abisai chun, “Keima hi i kuoma chun zu fe vêng ka tih,” a ta."
"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.","Chuongchun, David le Abisai chu mipuihai umnaah zâna chun an zu feh a; chun, ngai ta, Saula chu tawlailîr huol sûnga chun a lo zâl a, a lu tieng chun a fei chu hnuoia hin a sunbûr a; chun, Abner le mihai chu a vêla chun an zâl a."
"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.","Chuongchun, Abisai chun David kuomah, “Vawisûn hin i hmêlma chu Pathienin i kutah a pêk a ni hi, chuleiin, fei hin vawi khatin hnuoia hin hang sunde tlat el ka ti aw? Sun nawn nâwk naw tawp ka tih,” a ta."
"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah’s anointed, and be guiltless?","Nisienlakhawm, David chun Abisai kuomah, “Sukbohmang naw rawh, LALPA hrieknâl chunga kut thlâka thiem chang thei tu am um an ta?” a ta."
"And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.","Chun, David ma chun, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, LALPA chun a chungah kut thlâk naw nîm, an naw vêk leh a thi ni la hung tlung el a tih; a ni naw vêk leh indonaah fêng a ta, bohmang el a tih."
"Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.","LALPA hrieknâl chunga chun kut ka thlâk naw dingzie chu, a lu bula fei le tuiûm ruok kha chu la ta la aw, chuongchun, fe el ei tih,” a ta."
"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.","Chuongchun, David chun Saula lu bula fei le tuiûm chu a lâk a, an fe nâwk tah a, tukhawmin an hmu nawh a, tukhawm a hrie le har an um bawk nawh a; LALPA chun inhnik- taka ân ininnghiltir tâwl leiin an in vawng a nih."
"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;","Chuongchun, David chu râl khingtieng chun a feh a, hla fea hin tlâng sîpah a ngîr a, an inkâr chu hlatak a nih."
"and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?","Chun, David chun mipuihai le Nera naupa Abner chu, “Abner, i mi hung dawn naw ding am a nih,” tiin a ko a. Chuongchun, Abner chun a dawn a, “Lal hung ko veitu chu tu am i ni leh?” a ta."
"And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.","Chun, David chun Abner kuoma chun, “Mi huoisen i ni naw am a nih? Israel mihai lai hin nang ang tu am an um a? Iengtiziea lal i pu chu i vêng naw am a na? Lal i pu chu sukbo- hmang dingin tu amanih a hung kha tie."
"This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.","I thilthaw dân hi a ṭha naw a nih. LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, LALPA hrieknâl i pu chu i vêng ṭhat naw leiin thi el tlâk i nih. Lal lu thluona fei le tuiûm um kha khâw- lai am a um tah hang en ta hman,” a ta."
"And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.","Chun, Saula chun David râwl chu a hei hriet a, “Chu i râwl a ni maw ka naupa David,?” a hei tih a. David chun, “Aw lalpa, ka pu, ka râwl a ni chu,” a ta."
"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?","Chun, “Ieng leiin am ka lalpa hin a siehlaw hi a hnawt a na? Ieng thil am ka thaw a? Ka kuta hin thil suol ieng am a um a?"
"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.","Chuleiin, lalpa, ka pu chun a siehlaw thu hi ngai dingin ka hni che. Kei mi do dinga i lungril chawkthotu chu LALPA a ni chun thilinhlân chu pawm hrâm sienla; mihriem nauhai an ni ruok chun LALPA hmaah ṭawngsephurin um raw se, ‘Fe la, pathien danghai rawng bâwl rawh,’ tiha LALPA ro ka hluo thei nawna dinga vawisûn hin an mi hnawt hmang ka ni sih a."
"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.","Chuleiin, ka thisen chu LALPA hmu phâk nawah hnuoi chungah luong naw raw se; varung pêl dinga mihai chu tlânga chun an raminvâk angin Israel lal chu uihrik chau zawng dingin a fe suok a ni hi,” a ta."
"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.","Chuongchun, Saula chun, “Thil ka lo thaw suol dêr el a nih, ka naupa David, hung kîr nâwk rawh, i mithmuah ka hringna hi vawisûn hin a hlut êm leiin iengkhawm law ta naw hrim hrim ka ti che, ngai ta, thil invêtthlâktak ka lo thaw tah a, ka lo thaw suol dêr el a ni ta hi,” a ta."
"And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.","Chun, David chun a dawn a, “Aw lalpa, fei hi hei en ta, tlangvâl pakhat hung sienla hung la raw se."
"And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed.","Chun, LALPA chun mi tin an fel man le an ringumna man a pêk ding a na, vawisûn hin LALPA chun nang hi ka kutah a pêk che deh a chu LALPA hrieknâl chungah ka kut kân let nuom naw a nih."
"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.","Ngai ta, vawisûna i hringna ka ngaihlutpêk che ang bawk hin LALPA chun ka hringna hi mi ngaihlupêk sienla, lunginzîngna po poa inthawk hin mi sansuok raw se,” a ta."
"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.","Chuongchun, Saula chun David kuomah, “Ka naupa David, mal- sâwmin um raw khai, thilthawthei- takin um i ta, hne pei i tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chu a feh a, chun, Saula khawm chu ama hmun tieng chun a fe ve tah a."
"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.","Chun, David chun a lungrilin “Iengtika mani chu Saula kuta hin ka la bohmang ngei ding chu a ni hi; Philistin mihai rama tlânhmang nêka ṭha hi a um naw ding a ni hi; chuongchun, Saulan Israel ram sûng po poa a mi zawng hi beidawng tâng a ta, chuongchun, a kuta inthawka suok nîng ka tih,” a ta."
"And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.","Chuongchun, David chu a tho a, a kuoma mi za ruk umhai le chun Maok naupa Gath lal Akis kuomah an fe tah a."
"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.","Chun, David chu ama le a mihai leh, mi tin an sûngkuoin, David khawm a nuhmei pahnihai Jezreel mi Ahinoam le Nabal nuhmei Karmela mi Abigail leh, Gath khuoha Akis kuomah an um tah a."
And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.,"Chun, David chu Gath khuoah a tlân ti Saula chu an hril a, chuong- chun, a zawng nâwk ta nawh a."
"And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?","Chun, David chun Akis kuomah, “Mi lunginsiet la, i rama khuo pa- khata hin umna hmun mi pe hai sienla, chutaka chun um ka tih; i siehlaw hi iengdingin am lal khuoah um zing a ta?” a tih a."
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.,"Chuongchun, Akis chun chu ni chun Ziklag khuo chu a pêk tah a: chuleiin, Ziklag khuo chu tu chen hin Judai ram lalhai ta a ni ta zing a."
And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.,"Chun, Philistin rama David a um sûng chu kum khat pumhlûm le thla li a nih."
"And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.","Chun, David le a mihai chu an hang feh a, Gesur mihai dâm, Girzi mihai dâm, Amalek mihai dâm an rûn a; chuong hnamhai chu tienlaia inthawkin Sur ram tieng pang Aigupta ram chena um an nih."
"And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.","Chun, David chun ram chu a thaw a, a nuhmei a pasalin hla hrim hrim a nei nawh a, berâmhai dâm, sebâwnghai dâm, sabengtunghai dâm, sanghâwngseihai dâm, an silfên dâm a lâkpêk a; chun a kîr nâwk a, Akis kuomah a feh a."
"And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.","Akis chun, “Vawisûn hin khaw tieng am i rûn a?” a ta. David chun, “Juda Sim ram dâm, Jerahmeel Sim ram dâm, Ken mihai Sim ram dâm,” a ta."
"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.","Chun, David chun, “Philistin rama a um sûng hrim hrimin, ‘David chun hieng ang hin a thaw rawp hlak a nih,’ ti rawi an tih,” tiin a nuhmei a pasalin Gath khuoa ṭhuoi ding hrim hrim a hla naw a nih."
"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.","Chun, Akis chun David thuhril chu awiin, “Ama le ama hi Israel mihai ân theidatir ta hle el a, chu- leiin, kumkhuoin ka siehlawah um a tih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.","Chun, chuong lai chun Philistin mihai chun an sipaihai chu Israel mihai thawa do dingin an ko khâwm rak el a. Chun, Akis chun David kuomah, “Nang le i mihai chu sipaihai lai, ka kuomah in fe ve ngei ding a nih ti hre rawh,” a ta."
"And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.","Chun, David chun Akis kuomah, “Aw le, i siehlaw thilthawthei dân chu hre el i tih,” a ta. Chun, Akis chun David kuomah, “A ṭha chu! a mi vêngtuah siem kumkhuong ka ti che,” a ta."
"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.","Samuel chu a thi tah a, Israel mihai po poin an ṭah a, ama khuo ngei Rama khuoa chun an phûm tah a. Chun, Saula chun an khawhri aisânthiem zâwlnei le dawithiemhai chu a rama inthawk chun a hnawt suok vawng tah a."
"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu an pungkhâwm a, Sunema chun ṭhang- hmun an va khuor a; chun, Saula chun Israel mi po po a ko khâwm a, Gilboaah ṭhanghmun an khuor veh a."
"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.","Chun, Saula chun Philistin mi sipaihai a hmu chun a ṭih a, a lungril ân thin hlawp hlawp el a."
"And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.","Chun, Saula chun LALPA a hang rawn khawmin LALPA chun mangin amanih, Urimin amanih, zâwlneiin amani khawm a dawn hrim hrim nawh a."
"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a sie- hlawhai kuoma chun, “Khawhri aisânthiem zâwl nuhmei a kuoma ka fea ka râwn dingin mi zawngpêk ro,” a ta. Chun, a siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Endor khuoah khawhri aisânthiem zâwl nuhmei a um annaw,” an ta."
"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.","Chun, Saula chu ân sukdanglam a, a puon danglam a sil a, ama le mi dang pahni leh an feh a, zânah nuhmei kuoma chun an va tlung a; chun, khawhri aisânnu kuoma chun, “Ai mi sânpêk la, i kuoma hming ka lam taphawthai chu mi ko suokpêk rawh,” a ta."
"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?","Nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Saula thilthaw chu i hriet a, a rama khawhri aisânthiem le dawi- thiemhai chu a sukbo zo tah a, iengdingin am ka thina dingin ka hringna châng i kam ding a ni leh?” a ta."
"And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.","Chun, Saula chun LALPA hming sâlin, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril hi, hi thil lei hin i chungah hremna tlung naw nih,” tiin a kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm a."
"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun, “Tu am hang ko suokpêk ka ti cheh a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Samuel mi hung ko suokpêk rawh,” a ta."
"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.","Chun, nuhmei chun Samuel a hang hmu chun râwl inringtakin a khêk a; chun, nuhmei chun Saula kuomah, “Iengdinga i mi hlêm am a na, Saula i ni zing sih a?” a ta."
"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, ieng am a ni ta leh i hmu?” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun Saula kuomah, “Hnuoia inthawka pathien hung suok ka hmu,” a ta."
"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.","Chun, a kuomah, “Ieng ang am a na?” a ta. Ama chun, “Tarsie hi a hung suok a, zakawfuol a hâk,” a ta. Chun, Saula chun Samuel a nih ti a hriet a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a."
"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Iengdinga hienga i mi ko suok buoi am a na?” a ta. Saula chun a dawn a, “Ka lunginzîng êm êm ela a nih, Philistin mihai chun an mi do a, Pathien hlak chun a mi nghatsan a, zâwlneiin amanih, mangin amani khawm a mi dawn ta hrim hrim nawh a; chuleiin, ka thaw ding mi hril dingin ka ko el che a nih,” a ta."
"And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?","Chun, Samuel chun, “Chuonga LALPA chun a nghatsan ta cheh a, i hmêlma a hung ni tah ti hre zing sa chun iengdinga thu i mîn dawn am a na?"
"And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.","Keima hmanga a hril ang khan LALPA chun i chungah a thaw tah a ni chu; LALPA chun i kuta inthawkin ram chu a lâkpêk a, i tuolbâwm David ngei chu a pêk tah a nih."
"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.","LALPA thu i awi naw lei le, Amalek mihai chunga a lunginsenna nasatak ang khan, i hlen naw leiin tuhin i chungah hi thil hi a thaw tah a ni hi."
Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.,"Chu naw khawm chu LALPA chun nang le Israel mihai khawm chu Philistin mihai kutah pêng a ta; chun, zînga hin nang le i naupasalhai chu ka kuomah hung um in tih; LALPA chun Israel sipaihai khawm chu Phi- listin mihai kutah pêng a tih,” a ta."
"Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.","Chuongchun, Samuel thuhril lei chun Saula chu a ṭi ta êm êm el a, hnuoiah a tlu dêr el tah a, tha le zung hrim hrim a nei ta nawh a, sûn- nithlâk le zânkhawvâra bu fa lo a ni sih a."
"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.","Chun, nuhmei chu Saula kuoma chun a feh a, a lungngai êm êm ti a hriet a, a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i siehlawnu hin i hril chu ka awi a, thi le thi tiin ka kuoma i thuhrilhai chu ka pawm a nih."
"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.","Chuleiin, nang khawmin i siehlawnu thu chu awi ve rawh, bu tlâwmte bêk hung pêng ka ti che a, chuongchun, i fe phaa thahrui i nei theina dingin fa rawh,” a ta."
"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.","Nisienlakhawm, a nuom nawh a, “Fa naw ningah,” a ta. Nisienla- khawm, a siehlawhai chun nuhmei le chun an tir ṭâl a, an thu chu a awi tah a.

"And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:","Chun, nuhmei chun sebâwngte châwm thau a ina chun a nei a, a va that vak a, chun, beiphit a lâk a, a hmet a, chawl ṭhanglo bei a siem a."
"and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.","Saula le a siehlawhai hmaa chun a va sieh a, chun, an lo fâk tah a. Chuongchun, an tho a, chu zân chun an fe tah a."
Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.,"Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun an sipaihai po po chu Apheka chun an ko khâwm vawng a; chun, Israel mihai chun Jezreela tui- khur kâwlah ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.","Chun, Philistinhai lalhai chu sâng têl têl dâmin, za têl têl dâmin an fe zut zut el a."
"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?","Chun, David le a mihai le Akis le chun hnung an dâl a.

"But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?","Nisienlakhawm, Philistin lalhai chu a chungah an lunginsen a, a kuomah, “Ama chu i hmun ruotpêka khan kîr nâwk dingin infetir la, indonaah kan kuoma chun fe ve naw raw se; chuong naw chun indonaah ei hmêlmahai tieng ṭhang el rawi a tih; hieng mihai luhai laia ding hin hi mipa hi a lalpa leh an inrem nâwk el âwm deh aw?"
"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?","Hi David hi a ni naw am a nih lâm puma: ‘Saulain a sânga sâng a that a, Davidin a sînga sîng a that a,’ tiha a chungchâng thu hlaa an sak kha?” an ta."
"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.","Chuongchun, Akis chun David chu a ko a, a kuomah, “LALPA hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih, mi indiktak i lo na, sipaihai lai ka kuoma i fea i hung hlak chu ka mithmua chun a ṭha hle el a; ka kuoma i hung nia inthawk vawisûn chen hin i chungah ieng- khawm ṭhat nawna hrim hrim ka hmu dêr nawh a; nisienlakhawm, lal- hai rawi hin an ngaina naw che a nih."
"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.","Chuleiin, Philistin lalhai i suk- lungninaw nawna dingin kîr nâwk la, lungâwitakin fe el rawh,” a ta."
"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?","David chun Akis kuomah, “Anleh ieng thil am ka lo thaw leh? i kuoma ka um sûng po vawisûn chen hin, ka pu, laltak hmêlma chu do loa ka hang kîr nâwk elna dingin i siehlaw chung- a hin ieng am hriet i nei leh?” a ta."
"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.","Akis chun a dawn a, David kuom- ah, “Ka mithmua chun Pathien vântirko ang elin i ṭhah a, nisien- lakhawm, Philistin lalhai hin, ‘Indonaah kan kuomah hung ve naw nih,’ an ti tlat el a."
"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.","Chuleiin, i kuoma fe ve, i pu siehlawhai le hin zîngkâr tho unla, chun, zîngkâr in tho a, khuo a var phing le chun fe el ro,” a ta."
"So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai chu Philistin rama kîr dinga zîngkâra suok dingin zîngkâr an tho tah a. Chun, Philistin mihai chu Jezreelah an hang fe tah a."
And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.,"Chun, naupang Samuel chun Eli hmaa chun LALPA rawng a bâwl a. Chuong lai chun LALPA thu chu a hlu hle el a, ân langa inlârnahai a um nawh a."
"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, Eli chu ama hmuna a zâl laiin (a mit ân thim ta deu a, khuo a hmu ṭha thei mang ta nawh a),"
"and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;","Pathien khâwnvar khawm a la thi hmain, Pathien bâwm umna LALPA biek ina chun Samuel chu a hang zâl a;"
"that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.","LALPA chun Samuel chu a ko a, ama chun, “Hitaka hi ka um,” a ta."
"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.","Chun, Eli kuoma chun a va tlân a, a kuomah, “Hitaka hi ka um, i mi ko a,” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka ko naw che ie, va zâl nâwk ta rawh,” a ta."
"And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel chu a ko nâwk a. Samuel chu a tho a, Eli kuoma chun a feh a, “Hitaka hi ka um, i mi ko a,” a ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Ka ko naw che ie, ka naupa, va zâl nâwk ta rawh,” a ta."
"Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.","Chuong lai chun Samuel chun LALPA a la hriet nawh a, LALPA thu a kuoma phuong a la ni naw bawk a."
"And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel a ko nâwk a, chu chu a vawi thumna a nih. Chun, a tho a, Eli kuoma chun a feh a, “Hitaka hi ka um, i mi ko a,” a ta. Chuongchun, Eli chun naupang chu LALPAIN a ko a nih ti a lo hriet tah a."
"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","Chuleiin, Eli chun Samuel kuom- a chun, “Fe la, va zâl nâwk phawt la, a ko nâwk che chun, ‘LALPA, thu hril rawh, i siehlaw hin a ngai zing,’ ti el rawh” a ta. Chuongchun, Samuel chu a hmuna chun a va zâl nâwk tah a."
"And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.","Chun, LALPA chu a hung a, a hung ngîr a, a hmaa a ko ang khan, “Samuel, Samuel,” tiin a ko nâwk a. Chuongchun, Samuel chun, “Thu hril rawh, I siehlaw hin a ngai zing,” a ta."
"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, Israel rama hin a hre taphawthai na chu a khing hni hnia a ṭhâwng zâwngtakin thil ka thaw ding a nih."

"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.",A nauhaiin Pathien an hrilsiet- na suol chu hre zing pumin a khap naw leiin a sûngkuo chu kumkhuoa dingin ka ngaituo ding a nih ti ka hril ta sih a.
"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.","Chuleiin, Eli sûngkuo kuoma chun Eli sûnghai bawsietna chu in- thâwinain amanih, thilinhlânin ama- nih iengtika khawm sukkieng thei ni naw nih, tiin ṭawng kân khâm tah a nih,” a ta."
"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.","Samuel chu zingkâr chenin a zâl a; chun, LALPA in kawtkhârhai chu a hawng a, Samuel chun chuong inlârna chu Eli inhriettir ding chu a ṭih a."
"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.","Chun, Eli chun Samuel chu a ko a, “Samuel, ka naupa,” a ta. Ama chun, “Hitaka hin ka um,” a ta."
"And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.","Chun, ama chun, “Ieng thil am LALPA chun i kuomah a hril lie?

"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.","Chun, Samuel chu a hung a, iengkim el chu a hril fai vawng a, a kuoma chun iengkhawm ip a nei nawh a.

"And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.","Chun, Samuel chu a hung in- ṭhanglien deu deu a, a kuomah LALPA a um pei a; a thu hrim hrim chu lei- hnuoiah ân luonghmangtir el nawh a."
And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, Dana inthawka Beer-seba tlung rakin Israel mi po pohai chun Samuel chu LALPA zâwlnei dinga sukdet a ni tah ti an hriet tah a."
And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.,"Chun, LALPA chu Siloa chun ân lâr nâwk a; LALPA chu thuin Samuel kuoma chun Siloa chun ân lâr a ni sih a."
"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,","Chun, a ni thum nia David le a mihaiin Ziklag an tlung chun Amalek mihaiin Simtieng le Ziklag khuo chu an lo rûn zing tah a.

"and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.","nuhmeihai le chu khuoa um taphawthai chu a lien a chînin salah an man a, tukhawm that loin an ṭhuoi a, an fepui tah a."
"And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.","Chun, David le a mihaiin khuo an va tlung chun, ngai ta, a lo kâng fai vawng tah a; chun, an nuhmeihai, an naupasalhai, an naunuhmeihai chu salah an lo man tah a."
"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.","Chuongchun, David le a kuoma umhai chun an râwl an insuoh a, ṭap hlei thei lo lêkin an ṭap a."
"And David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.","Chun, David nuhmeihai pahni Jezreel mi Ahinoam le Karmela mi Nabal nuhmei Abigail hai khawm chu salah an ṭhuoi tah a."
"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.","Chun, David chu a lunginzîng hle el a, mi tin an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai leiin mi po po an lungril a na êm êm a, ama chu lunga dêng thu an hril leiin; nisienla- khawm, David chu a Pathien LALPAA chun ân sukhrât a."
"And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.","Chun, David chun Ahimelek naupa thiempu Abiathar kuoma chun, “Thiempu zakawsîng mi va lapêk raw khai,” a ta. Abiathar chun David chu thiempu zakawsîng a va lâkpêk a."
"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt without fail recover all.","Chun, David chun, “Chuonghai chu hnawt lang, la hnawt phâk ka ti?” tiin LALPA ân dawn a. Ama chun a hung dawn a, “Hnawt rawh, hnawt phâk ngei ngei i ta, sansuok vawng ngei ngei i tih,” a ta."
"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.","Chuongchun, David chu a fe tah a, ama le a kuoma mi za rukhai le chun; chun, Besor vadung chu an va tlung a, chutaka chun an mi mâksanhai chu an um a."
"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.","David ruok chun a hnawt pei a, ama le mi za lihai le chun, mi za hni chu an chau ta leiin Besor vadung chu an kai thei ta nawh a, an lo um tah a nih."
"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink;","Chun, phûla hin Aigupta mi an va hmuh a, David kuoma chun an ṭhuoi a, bei an pêk a, a lo fâk a; chun, tui dâwn ding an pêk a;"
"and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.","chun, theichang hlawm tlang khat le grêp ra emṭâwl bâwr hni an pêk a; chun, chuong chu a hang fâk chun a hung har nâwk tah a; ni thum le zân thum bu fa lo le tui dâwn lo a ni sih a."
"And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Tu mi am i na?

"We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.","Kereth Sim ram le Juda chan Sim ramhai kan rûn a, chun, Kaleb Sim ram kan rûn bawk a; chun, Ziklag khuo khawm kan rawh a,” a ta."
"And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.","David chun a kuomah, “Chuonghai rawi umnaa chun mi zu ṭhuoi thei i ti?” a ta. Ama chun, “Mi that lo ding le, ka pu kuta mi pe nâwk lo dingin Pathien hming sâlin ṭawng inkhâm la, chuongchun, chuonghai umnaa chun zu ṭhuoi ka ti che,” a ta."
"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.","Chun, a zuk ṭhuoi thlâk chun, ngai ta, Philistin ram le Judai rama râllâk tamtak an lâk leiin ruoi an ṭheh a, an fâkin an dâwn a, an lo um dar nei nuoi a."
"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.","Chuongchun, David chun nisa tlâka inthawkin a zînga zântieng chenin a thaw tah a, tlangvâl za li, sanghâwngsei chunga chuonga tlân- sehai ti chau naw chu tukhawm dama suok hrim hrim an um nawh a."
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.,"Chun, David chun Amalek mihaiin an lâk po po chu a lâk nâwk vawng a; chun, David chun a nuhmei pahnihai chu a sansuok bawk a."
"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.","Chuongchun, a lien a chînin an naupasalhai, an naunuhmeihai, an râllâk le an thil lâk hrim hrim iengkhawm chân an nei nawh a, David chun a lâkpêk nâwk vawng a nih."
"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.","Chun, David chun berâm ruol le ran ruolhai po po chu a lâk a, ran danghai hmaa chun an khal a, “Hieng hi David râllâk a ni hi,” an ta."
"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.","Chun, mi za hni an châu leia David zui thei loa Besor vadunga an inumtirhai kuom chu David chun a va tlung a; chun, anni chu David tuok ding le a kuoma um vehai chu tuok dingin an fe suok a; chun, David chun mipuihai kuom a va tlung chun chibai a bûk tâwl a."
"Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.","Chuongchun, David kuoma fe vehai laia mi suolhai le Belial mihai po po chun an dawn a, “Ei kuoma an fe ve naw leiin râllâk thil ei va lâk- pêk nâwk hrim hrim chu pe ve nâwng ei ta, an ṭhuoi a, an fe theina dingin an nuhmeihai le an nauhai seng ruok chu an ṭhuoi phal ei tih,” an ta."
"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.","Chuongchun, David chun, “Unauhai, LALPA chun a mi humpêk a, mi do dinga hung inthawkhai ei kuta petu thil mi pêkhai chu chuong ang chun thaw naw ti niu."
"And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike.","Tuin am hi thua hin in thu hi pawm a ta? Indonaa zu fehai chan ang bawk chu thuomhnaw vênga lo umhai chun an chang ve ding an- nâwm; inang vawnga chang ding a nih,” a ta."
"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.","Chuongchun, chu nia inthawk tu chen hin Israelhai ta dinga thupêk le dâna nei dingin a siem tah a."
"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:","Chun, Davidin Ziklag khuo a tlung chun, râllâk ṭhenkhat chu, “Hi hi LALPA hmêlmahaia inthawka râllâk, lâwmman dingin kân phur cheu,” tiin,"

"and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,","Aroera um dâm, Sipmoth-a um dâm, Estemoa um dâm:"
"and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,","Rakala um dâm, Jerahmeel khuohaia umhai dâm, Ken khuohaia umhai dâm:"
"and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,","Hormaa umhai dâm, Borasana umhai dâm, Athaka umhai dâm,"
"and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.","Hebrona umhai dâm, David le a mihai chêttlatna hmun po poa um Juda upa, a ruolhai kuoma chun a thawn a."
"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun Israel mihai chu an do a, chun, Israel mihai chu Philistin mihai hmaa chun an tlânseh a: Gilboa tlânga chun thatin an um ta zul el a."
"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Saula le a naupasalhai chu an hnawt zui ta ngat ngat a; chun, Philistin mihai chun Saula naupasalhai, Jonathan le Abinadab le Malkisua chu an that a."
"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.","Chun, Saula chu an thaw nasa ta êm êm el a, thal kâp mihai chun an hnawt phâk tah a: thal kâp mihai lei chun a lunginzîng ta êm êm el a."
"Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a râl- thuom chawitu kuoma chun, “I kâwlhnâm kha phawi la, mi hang sunthleng rawh, chuong naw chun hieng sertanlohai hi hung an ta, mi hung sunthleng an ta, mi uongkhum nghe nghe rawi an tih,” a ta.

"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.","Chun, a râlthuom chawitu chun Saula a thi ti a hriet chun, ama khawm chun a kâwlhnâm chu a bawlût veh a, an thi rêl tah a."
"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.","Chuongchun, Saula leh, a nau- pasal pathumhai leh, a râlthuom chawitu leh, a mihai po po leh, chu ni ngei chun an thi seng tah a nih."
"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.","Chun, ruom râl khingtienga Israel mi umhai le Jordan râla um- haiin Israel mihai an tlânsie ti le Saula le a naupasalhai an thi ti an hriet chun, khuohai chu an suoksan a, an tlânhmang tah a; chun, Phi- listin mihai chun an va hluo tah a."
"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.","Chun, a zînga chun Philistin mihaiin an râl thathai thuom hlîppêk dinga an va fe chun Saula le a naupasal pathumhai Gilboa tlânga an lo thi chu an va hmuh a."
"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.","Chun, a lu chu an tan a, a râlthuom chu an hlîp a, chanchin chu an milim biekna ina le mihai kuoma phuong dingin Philistin rama chun an inphur vêl a."
And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.,"A râlthuom chu Astaroth inah an sieh a, a ruong chu Bethsan kul banga chun an târ a."
"And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,","Chun, Jabes-gileada umhaiin Philistin mihaiin Saula an thaw dân chungchâng thu chu an lo hriet chun,"
"all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.","mi huoisenhai po po chu an tho a, zânkhawvârin an feh a, Saula ruong le a naupasalhai ruong Beth- san kul banga inthawk chun an lâk a; chun, Jabes an hung tlung a; chutaka chun an rawh a."
"And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.","Chun, an ruhai chu an lâk a, Jabesa tamarisk thing hnuoiah an phûm a; chun, ni sari bu an nghei a."
"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.","Chun, Samuel thu chu Israel mi po po lai chun ân thang suok tah a."
"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu Israel mihai lo dang dingin an lo inzar dar a; chun, an hang inthaw chun Philistin mihai hmaa chun Israel mihai chu an tlâwm tah a; indona hmuna chun sipai sâng li lai amanih an that a."
"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.","Chun, mipuihai chu an riek- hmuna an fe chun Israel upahai chun, “Ieng leia vawisûn hin Philistin mihai hmaa LALPAIN a mi suk- tlâwm am a nih aw?

"So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chun Siloa chun mi an tir a, chutaka in- thawk chun cherubim chunga ṭhung, sipaihai LALPA thuthlung bâwm chu an va lâk tah a; Pathien thuthlung bâwm an lâknaa chun Eli naupasal- hai pahni Hophni le Phinehas an ṭhang veh a."
"And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.","Chuongchun, LALPA thuthlung bâwmin an riekhmun a hung tlung chun, Israel mi po pohai chu inring- takin an khêk ta dur dur el a, hnuoi chen khawm a tlawr ri dur dur el a."
"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.","Chun, Philistin mihaiin an khêkri an hriet chun, “Hebraihai riekhmuna khêkri inri ta dur dur el chu iengtizie am a ni ta leh?” an ta. Chun, an riekhmuna chun LALPA bâwm a hung tlung a nih ti an hriet tah a."
"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun an ṭi tah a, “Riekhmuna chun Pathien a hung a ni ta chu teh,” an tih a. “Ei chung a rik ie, kha hma khan chuong ang chu a um ngai si nawh a."
Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.,"Ei chung a rik ie! chuong pathienhai kut hrâttaka inthawk chun tuin am mi sandam a ta?

"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.","Aw, nangni Philistin mihai, in siehlawa an um ang khan Hebraihai siehlawah in um nawna dingin hrâttakin um unla, insukpasal ro khai, insukpasal unla thaw pei ro,” an ta."
"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun an hang thawh a, Israel mihai chu an tlâwm a, an puonin tieng seng an tlân ta vawng a; an that nasa êm êm el a, Israelhai laia sipai sîng thum an thi a nih."
"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu an lâkpêk a; Eli naupahai pahni, Hophni le Phinehas chu an that bawk a."
"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.","Sipai laia Benjamin thla, mi pakhat a tlân a, a puonhai tlêr nung le a lua pilvut kai rakin chu ni ngei chun, Silo chu a va tlung a."
"And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.","Chun, a va tlung chun, Eli chun lampui sîra a ṭhungnaa ṭhung pumin a lo thlîr zing a, Pathien bâwm lei khan a lungrilin ân thin ân thin a.

"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli.","Eli chun an khêkri chu a lo hrietin, “Chu inri mur mur chu iengtizie am a na?” a ta. Chun, mi chu inhmawtakin a va feh a. Eli chu a va hril a."
"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.","Eli chu kum sâwmkuo le kum riet mi a na, a mit ân thim tah a, khuo a hmu thei ta nawh a."
"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?","Chun, mi chun Eli kuoma chun, “Sipai laia inthawka hung ka ni hi, vawisûn hin sipai laia inthawka hung tlân ka nih,” a ta. Ama chun, “ka naupa, ieng angin am thil a um a?” a ta."
"And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.","Chanchin hung intluntu chun a dawn a, “Israel mihai chu Philistin mihai hmaa chun an tlânseh a; chun, mipui lai chun inthatna nasatak a um bawk a; i naupahai pahni Hophni le Phinehas khawm an thih a; Pathien bâwm khawm an lâkpêk tah,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.","Chun, Pathien bâwm thu a hang hril phingle chun kawtkhâr bula ṭhungnaa inthawk chun a thalin a tluh a, a ring a tliek a, a thi tah a, ama hi a tar êm leiin ân dâwl zo ta naw a nih.

"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her.","Chun, a monu Phinehas nu- hmei chun nau a vawn a, a nei a hnai ta hleh a, Pathien bâwm an lâkpêk ti thu a hang hriet a, a tarpupa le a pasal an thi ti a hang hriet chun, a kûn a, nau chu a nei tah a, a nauha chun ama a hung nang nghâl ta sih a."
"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.","Chun, a thi vâng vâng laia a kâwla ngîr nuhmeihai chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, naupasal i nei ta hi,” an ta.

"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.","Chun, “Ropuina chun Israel- hai chu a suoksan tah,” tiin, nau- pang hminga chun Ikabod a sak a.

"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.","“Ropuina chun Israel chu a suoksan tah a, Pathien bâwm chu an lâkpêk ta sih a,” a ta."
"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun Pathien bâwm chu an lâk a, Ebenezera inthawk chun Asdod khuoah an fepui tah a."
"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Pathien bâwm chu an lâk a, Dagon biekna inah an lâklût a, Dagon kâwla chun an sieh a."
"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.","Chun, Asdod khuoa mihai chun a zînga zîngkâr an hang tho chun, ngai ta, LALPA bâwm hmaa chun Dagon chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a lo tlu dêr el a.

"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.","Chun, a zîngnâwk zîngkâr an hang tho chun, ngai ta, LALPA bâwm hmaa chun Dagon chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a lo tlu dêr el a; Dagon lu le a kutpha bâwr khing hni bawng chu kawtkhâr bula chun a lo inhlum ngul el a; Dagon chu a taksa chau a lo um el tah a."
"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.","Chu chu lei chun Dagon thiempu amanih, Dagon biekna ina hung hlakhai hrim hrim khawmin Asdod khuoa Dagon kawtkhâr bul chu tu chen khawm hin an la sir ngam naw a nih."
"But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.","LALPA kut chun Asdod khuoa mihai chu a del ta hle el a, sietna ân tlungtirpêk tâwl tah a, Asdod khuo le a vêl khuohai chu ngâwtin a hrem ta bawk a."
"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.","Chuongchun, Asdod khuoa mi- haiin chuong ang chu a nih ti an lo hrietin, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi ei kuoma hin um zing da raw se ie, ei chunga le ei pathien Dagon chunga a kutthlâk a na em el,” an ta."
"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel thither.","Chuongchun, Philistin lal po pohai chu an kuomah an ko khâwm a, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi iengtin am ei thaw ding a na?” an ta. Anni chun, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm chu Gath khuoah va fepui ro,” tiin an dawn a; chuongchun, Israelhai Pathien bâwm chu an va fepui tah a."
"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.","Chun, chuonga an fetlungpui chun, LALPA kut chun khuo chu a hung sukbuoi tah a, khuoa mi- hriemhai chu a chîn a lienin a hrem a, ngâwtna hri an chungah ân lêngtir a."
"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.","Chuongchun, Pathien bâwm chu Ekronah an infetir a.

"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.","Chuongchun, Philistin lalhai po po chu an ko khâwm a, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi infe hmangtir unla keini le kan mihai a mi sukhlum nawna dingin a umna hmun pângngaiah fe nâwk raw se,” an ta.

And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.,"A thi nawhai khawm chu ngâwtin an na tâwl a; chuongchun, chu khaw khêkri chun vân khi a hang tlung a."
And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.,LALPA bâwm chu Philistin mihai rama chun thla sari a um a.
"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall send it to its place.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun, “LALPA bâwm hi iengtin am thâwng ei ta? A umna pângngaia infetir nâwkna dân ding mi hril ta u khai,” tiin thiempuhai le aisânthiemhai an ko a."
"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.","Anni chun, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi infetir ding in ni khawma a ruok chun infetir dêr naw ro, a kuomah bâwsietna inthâwina inhlân ngei ro, chuongchun, sukdamin um in ta, chun, iengtiziea a kut chu a sawnpêk naw cheu am a na ti hrieng in tih,” an ta."
"Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.","Chun, anni chun, “A kuoma kan bawsietna inthâwina inhlân ding chu ieng am nîng a ta?” an ta.

"Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.","Chuleiin, in ngâwt limhai le in ram suksetu chaichene lim chu siem unla; chun, Israelhai Pathien chu chawimawi ro; chuongchun, a kut chu in chunga dâm, in pathien chunga dâm, in ram chunga dâm sukzâng nuom rawi naw nîm."
"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?","Aigupta mihai le Pharaoin lung- ril an sukngar ang khan iengdinga in lungril in sukngar am a na? Anni laia thil maktaka a thaw khan anni kha ân fetir a, an suok a nih naw am a nih?"
"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;","Chuleiin, tuhin tawlailîr thar buotsai unla, bâwngpui pahni a nêne sâwr lai, rîngkawl lân bâttir ngailo chu bel unla; chun, an têhai chu in tieng hung ṭhuoipêk ro."
"and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu la unla, tawlailîra chun sie unla, chun, baw- siet thilînhlâna in inhlân rângkachak thil hlu chu thingrema khumin a sîr- ah sie unla, infetir unla, inthla el ro."
"And see; if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.","Chuongchun, ama ramri tieng lampui hrawin Beth-semesa chun a fe am en ta u; a fe chun ei chunga thil ṭha nawtak hi ama thaw nîng a ta, a fe naw chun a mi hremtu chu ama kut a lo ni nawh ti hrieng ei ta, ei chunga hung um ve hrim hrim nîng a tih,” an tih a."
"And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;","Chun, mihai chun chuong ang chun an thawh a, bâwngpui a nêne sâwr lai pahni an ṭhuoi a, tawlailîra chun an bel a, an têhai chu in tieng an khum a;"

"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.","Chun, bâwngpuihai chun Beth- semes tieng panin lam chu an hraw ta ngat ngat a; chuongchun, inbu malam peiin lam tluongpui chu an hrawh a, changtieng amanih, vawitieng ama- nih khawm an pêt dêr nawh a; Philistin lalhai chun Beth-semes ramri chenin an zui a."
"And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.","Chun, Beth-semes khuoa mihai chun ruoma hin an bu an lo sîk a, an hang nghah a, bâwm chu an hang hmuh a, an lâwm ta êm êm a."
"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.","Tawlailîr chu Beth-semes khuoa mi Josua loa chun a hung lût a, lungpui lientak umna laia chun a ngîr ta zing a; chun, tawlailîr thing chu an chêk a, LALPA biekna dingin bâwngpuihai chu pumrawhmang thil inhlân dingin an hmang tah a."
"And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah.","Chun, Levi chihai chun LALPA bâwm chu rângkachak thil hlu umna thingrem le chun an lâk thlâk a, lungpui chunga chun an sieh a; chun, Beth-semes khuoha mihai chun chu ni vêk chun pumrawhmang thil in- hlânhai le inthâwinahai chu LALPA kuomah an inhlân a."
"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.","Chu chu Philistin lal pangahai chun an hmu zo chun, chu ni le le chun Ekron khuo tieng an kîr nâwk tah a."
"And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;","Philistin mihaiin rângkachak ngâwt lim LALPA kuoma bawsietna inthâwina dinga an inhlân chu hieng zât hi a nih; Asdod khaw puolin pakhat, Gaza khaw puolin pakhat, Askelon khaw puolin pakhat, Gath khaw puolin pakhat, Ekron khaw puolin pakhat;"
"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah, which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.","chun, rângkachak chaichene lim chu khuo po po kul nei khuo le thingtlâng tieng khuo khawm tiem vawng a, lal pangahai ta Philistin mihai khaw zât a nih.

"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.","Chuongchun, Kiriath-jearim khuoa mihai kuoma chun, “Philistin mihai chun LALPA bâwm chu an hung sie nâwk tah a, hung thla unla, in kuom tieng hung la ro khai,” tiha hril dingin mihai an tir a."
"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, Kiriath-jearim khuoa mi- hai chu an zu feh a, LALPA bâwm chu an zu lâk a, tlânga Abinadab ina chun an lâklût a, a naupa Eleazar chu LALPA bâwm enkawltu dingin an suktum a."
"And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.","Chun, Kiriath-jearima bâwm a um sûng chu sâwttak a na, kum sâwmhni zet a nih; chun, Israel sûnghai po po chun LALPA chu an lunglên nâwk tah a."
"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.","Chun, Samuel chun Israel sûng- hai po po kuoma chun, “In lungril takzeta LALPA tieng hung ngha tak tak in ni chun, ram dang pathienhai le Astaroth dâm in laia chu sie hmang dai ta unla, in lungril chu LALPA ta dingin buotsai unla, ama rawng chau chu bâwl ro; chuongchun, Philistin mihai kuta inthawk hi a sansuok ding cheu a nih,” a ta."
"Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.","Chun Israel mihai chun Baalhai le Astarothhai chu an sie hmang a, LALPA rawng chau chu an bâwl tah a."
"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun, “Israel mi- hai po po chu Mizpaah ko khâwm vawng unla, LALPA kuomah ṭawng- ṭaipêk ka ti cheu,” a ta."
"And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.","Chuongchun, Mizpaa chun an fe khâwm tah a; chun, tui an chawi a, LALPA hmaa chun an bunthlâk a, chu ni chun bu an nghei a, chutaka chun, “LALPA chunga chun ei lo suol tah a nih,” an ta.

"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Israel mihai Mizpaah an um khâwm ti an hriet chun Israel mihai do dingin Philistin lalhai chu an hang inthawk a.

"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.","Chuongchun, Israel mihai chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Philistin mihai kuta mi sandam dinga LALPA i mi kopêk chu ma naw raw khai,” an ta."
"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto Jehovah: and Samuel cried unto Jehovah for Israel; and Jehovah answered him.","Chun, Samuel chun berâmte nêne ne lai a lâk a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin LALPA kuomah ân hlân a, Israel mihai ta dingin Samuel chun LALPA chu a ko a; chun, LALPA chun a hung dawn a."
"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel.","Chun, Samuelin pumrawhmang thilinhlân ân hlân lai tak chun Philistin mihai chun Israel mihai chu thaw dingin an hung hnai a, nisien- lakhawm, chu ni chun LALPAIN Philistin mihai chungah vân nasa- takin ân rûmtir ta dur dur el a, a sukbuoi tah a; Israel mihai hmaa chun an tlâwm ta dêr el a."
"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.","Chun, Israel mihai chu Mizpaa inthawk chun an suok a, Philistin mihai chu an hnawt a, Beth-kar hnuoi an tlung chenin an that pei a."
"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun lung a lâk a, Mizpa le Sen inkâra chun a phun a, “Hi chen hi LALPAIN a mi ṭhangpui a nih,” tiin a hminga chun Ebenezer ân bûk a."
"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chu an tlâwm tah a, Israelhai rama chun an fe nâwk ta nawh a.

"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.","Chun, Philistin mihaiin Israel- hai khuo an lâkhai chu Ekrona inthawka Gath chenin Israel mihai an pêk kîr nâwk a, a ram chu Israel mihaiin Philistin mihai kuta in- thawkin an sansuok a.

And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.,Samuel chun a dam sûngin Israel mihai ro a rêl a.
"And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.","Kum tinin Bethel le Gilgal le Mizpa hi a kan vêl hlak a, chuong hmunahai chun Israel mihai ro a rêl hlak a."
"And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar unto Jehovah.","Chun, a in umna a ni leiin Rama khuoa chun a fe nâwk hlak a; chutaka chun Israel mihai ro a rêl a, chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a."
"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.","Samuel chu a hung upa tah a, a naupasalhai chu Israel mihai chunga rorêltuhaiah a siem a."
"Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.","A nau lutir hming chu Joel a na, chun, a dawttu hming chu Abija a nih; anni chu Beer-sebaa rorêltu an na."
"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.","Nisienlakhawm, a nauhai chun a umdân chu an lâk ve nawh a, sum le pai tieng an hnawt a, thamnahai an lâk a, indik nawtakin ro an rêl a."
"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;","Chuongchun, Israel mi upahai po po chu an inkhâwm a, Rama khuoa Samuel kuomah an feh a,"
"and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.","a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i hung upa ta hle el a, i naupasalhai hlak chun i umdân hi an lâk ve dêr si nawh a; hnam danghai po po ang bawka kan chunga ro mi rêlpêk dingin lal mi siempêk raw khai,” an ta."
"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, a kuoma, “Ro mi rêlpêktu ding lal mi pe rawh,” an ti chun Samuel chu a suklâwm naw hleh a. Chuongchun, Samuel chu LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a."

"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.","Chuleiin, an thu ngai rawh, amiruokchu, ursûntaka tiemkamin an chunga rorêltu lal châng dân ding chu khîkhmu chie rawh,” a ta."
And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.,"Chun, Samuel chun LALPA thuhai po po chu lal hnitu mipuihai chu a hril vawng a."
"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;","“In chunga rorêltu lal châng dân ding chu hieng ang hi nîng a tih: in naupasalhai chu a sakawr le a tawlailîr chuongpuia hai ruot a ta, a tawlailîr hmaa tlânhai dâm um an ta;"
"and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.","chun, a sipai sâng hotua dâm, sâwmnga hotua dâm ruot a tih; ṭhenkhat chu a hnuoi inlettua dâm, a busîktua dâm, a indo thuomhnaw siemtua dâm, tawlailîr hmangruo siemtua dâm hmang a ta."
"And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.","In naunuhmeihai chu rimin- hnik siemtua dâm, bu suongtua dâm, bei siemtua dâm hmang a tih."
"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.","In lohai, in grêp huonhai, oliv huonhai, a ṭha ṭhahai chu lâkpêk a ti cheu a, a siehlawhai pêng a tih."
"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.","In thlai chi le in grêp huonhaia mi chu sâwma pakhat lâkpêk a ti cheu a, a siehlawhai le a hotuhai pêng a tih."
"And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.","In siehlawpahai, in siehlaw- nuhai, in tlangvâl ṭha ṭhahai le in sabengtunghai lâkpêk a ti cheu a, a sinthaw dingin ruoi a tih."
He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.,"In berâm ruol laia mi chu sâwma pakhat lâkpêk a ti cheu a; chun, ama siehlawhai nîng in tih."
And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.,"Chun, chu nia chun in la thlang ding in lal lei chun la khêk suok in ta, nisienlakhawm, chu nia chun LALPAIN dawn naw ni cheu,” a ta."
"But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun Samuel rawl chu an ngai nuom nawh a, “Ni lo e, lal kan nei ding a nih,"
"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.","chuongchun, hnam dang po pohai ang hung nîng kan ta, chun, kan lal chun ro mi rêlpêk a ta, kan hmahai chu ṭhuoiin râlhai mi dopui a tih,” an ta."
"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun mipui thuhrilhai po po chu a hriet a, LALPA naa chun a thun nâwk sâwng a."
"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel kuomah, “An rawl chu ngai la, lal siempêk rawh,” a ta. Chun, Samuel chun Israel mihai kuomah, “Mi tin mâni khuo sengah fe ta ro,” a ta."
"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.","Benjamin rama Benjamin thlaa mi mi pakhat mi hrât huoisen a um a, a hming chu Kis a nih; ama chu Abiel naupa a na, ama chu Zeror naupa a na, ama chu Bekorath naupa a na, ama chu Aphia naupa a nih."
"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.","Chun, ama chun naupa a nei a, a hming chu Saula a nih; tlangvâl pieng ṭhatak a na, Israel mihai laia chun ama nêka pieng ṭha hrim hrim an um nawh a, a liengko nêka insâng mi dang hrim hrim an um nawh."
"And the asses of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.","Chun, Saula pa Kis sabengtung- hai chu ân hmang tâwl a. Chuong- chun, Kis chun a naupa Saula kuoma chun, “Tho la, siehlaw pakhat ṭhuoi la, sabengtunghai va zawng raw khai,” a ta."
"And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.","Chuongchun, Ephraim tlâng ram dâm chu a fang a, chun Salisa ram dâm khawm chu a fang a, nisien- lakhawm, a hmu nawh a; chun, Saalim ram an fang nâwk a, chutaka khawm chun an um nawh a; chun, Benjamin mihai ram an fang nâwk a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu chuong ta nawh a."
"When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.","Zuph ram an tlung chun, Saula chun a kuoma um ve, a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Hung rawh, kîr nâwk el tâng ei tih, chuong naw chun, ka pa khan sabengtunghai ngaituo ṭhulin eini mi ngaituo lem a tih,” a ta."
"And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi khuoa hin Pathien mi a um a, mi inzaumtak a na, a hril taphawt chu a hung tlung ngei ngei hlak a nih, hung rawh, chutaka chun va fêng ei tih, ei fena dâm hi a mi hril thei miel rawi mawh,” a ta."
"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?","Chuongchun, Saula chun a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Anachu, fe ta ang ni inla, ama chu ieng am chawipêk ei ta? Ei bâwma bei hlak a um ta si nawh a. Pathien mi ta dinga lâwmman chawi ding a um dêr nawh, ieng am ei nei aw?” a ta."
"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.","Siehlaw chun Saula chu a dawn nâwk a, “Ngai ta, tangka Shekel hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat ka la chawi a, chu chu ei fena ding a mi hril manah Pathien mi chu pe el ka tih,” a ta."
"(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)","(Kha hma khan chu Israelhai lai khan miin Pathien an râwn nuom chun, “Hung rawh, hmutheitu kuomah fêng ei tih,” an ti hlak a; tulaia Zâwlnei an ti hlak hi, kha hma khan chu Hmutheitu an ti hlak a nih.)"
"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.","Chun, Saula chun a siehlaw kuoma chun, “A ṭha hlau chu, fe ta nâwm ei nîm”, a ta. Chuongchun, Pathien mi umna khuoa chun an fe tah a."
"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?","Khaw hang pannaa an hang fe lai chun nunghâk tui chawi dinga hung suokhai an hmuh a, an kuomah, “Hitaka hin Hmutheitu chu a um am?” an ta."
"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place.","Anni chun an dawn a, “Um e, in hmaa khan a hung a nih, inhmaw ro khai, vawisûn hin khuoah a hung a nih, vawisûn hin bâwlhmunahai mihai an inthâwi a nih,"
"As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.","khuo in hang lût hlimin bâwlhmuna bu fa dinga a fe hmain hang hmu nghâl el in tih; in- thâwina malsâwmtu ding a ni leiin a tlung hmakhat chu mipui chun bu an fâk naw ding a nih, chu hnunga chun an mi fielhai chun an fâk hlak a nih. Chuleiin, hang fe vak unla, hang hmu nghâl el in tih,” an ta."
"And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.","Chuongchun, khuoa chun an hang fe tah a. Khuo an hang lût chun, Samuel bâwlhmuna fe ding chun ân tuokpui a."
"Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,","Chun, Saula hung hma ni khata chun LALPA chun Samuel chu a lo hril rûk a,"
"To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.","“Zîngah hieng ang hun lai hin Benjamin rama inthawkin i kuomah mi pakhat ka hung tir ding a na, ka mi Israel chunga hotu ni dingin hriek nâl i ta, ama chun Philistin mihai kuta inthawkin ka mihai sandam a tih; an khêkri chun ka kuom a hung tlung ta leiin ka mihai chu ka ngaisak tah a nih,” tiin."
"And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.","Chun, Samuelin Saula a hmu chun, LALPAIN a kuomah, “En ta, i kuoma ka mi hril kha, ama hin ka mihai chungah thu nei a tih,” a ta."
"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.","Chuongchun, Saula chun kul kawtkhâra chun Samuel chu a va hnai a, “Hmutheitu in chu khâwlai am a na, mi hril ta,” a ta."
"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.","Samuel chun Saula chu a dawn a, “Keima hi hmutheitu chu ka nih, ka hmaa hin bâwlhmun tieng panin fe la, vawisûn hin ka kuomah bu i fâk ve ding a nih; chun, zîngah zîngkâr infetir ka ti cheh a, i lungrila um po po khawm hril ka ti che."
"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father’s house?","I sabengtung ni thum inhmang tahai chu lungkham naw rawh, an hmu tah. Israelhai laia ropuina po po chu tu ta ding am a na? I ta ding le i pa ina mi po pohai ta ding a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?","Saula chun a dawn a, “Israel hnam laia chîntak, Benjamin hnam ka ni naw am a nih? Chun, kan sûngkuo khawm Benjamin hnam sûngkuo lai po poa chîntak a ni naw am a nih? iengtiziea ka kuoma hienga hril am i nih a?” a ta."
"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.","Samuel chun Saula le a siehlaw chu a ṭhuoi a, mikhuol pindana chun a ṭhuoi lût a, an mi fiel sâwmthumhai lai chun hmun ropuitaka chun ân ṭhungtir a."
"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.","Chun, Samuel chun bu suongtu kuoma chun, “I kuoma sietum ding ka ti, chanvo ka pêk che kha hung la raw khai,” a ta."
"And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.","Chuongchun, bu suongtu chun a mal le a chunga um chu a hung lâk a, Saula hmaa chun a va sieh a. Chun, Samuel chun, “En ta, ka lo sietum hi! awt la fa rawh khai, hi huna dingin hi hi kan lo ruotpêk hrim che a nih, ‘Mi dâm ka fiel khâwm ie,’ ka ti bawk sih a,” a ta. Chuongchun, chu ni chun Saula chu Samuel hai le chun bu thlêng chu an awt hmunkhat tah a."
"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.","Chun, bâwlhmuna inthawka khuoa an fe thla chun in chungah Saula chu zâlna an siempêk a; a zâl tah a."
"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.","Chun, zîngkâr chun a tho a, nisa suok ding lai vêlin Samuel chun in chunga um Saula chu a ko a, “Tho la, infetir tâng ka ti che,” a ta. Chuongchun, Saula chu a tho a, ama le Samuel chu an fe suok tah a."
"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.","Khaw hmawrtâwng chu an zuk tlung chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Siehlaw hi ei hma tieng infetir la, (ama chu a fe tah a) nang ruok chu ngîr hri la, Pathien thu hang hril hri phawt ka ti che,” a ta."
