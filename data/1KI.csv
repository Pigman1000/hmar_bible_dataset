"Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.","Tûn lal David chu a kumhai a hung tam a, a hung tar ta hleh a, chuongchun, puonhaiin ama chu an inkhum hlak a, nisienlakhawm, a lum thei chuong nawh a."
"Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.","Chuongchun, a siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ka lalpa lal ta ding hinnunghâk tleirawl zawng ei tiu khai, lal bula hin um zing sienla, enkawl raw se; chun, i ângsûnga hin hung zâl sienla, ka lalpa hi a lum thei ding a nih,” an tih a."
"So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.","Chuongchun, Israel ram sûng po poa chun nunghâk hmêlṭha an zawng tah a; Sunam mi Abisag chu an va hmuh a, lal kuoma chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a."
"And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.","Nunghâk chu a hmêl a ṭha hle el a, lal chu a enkawl a, a rawng a bâwlpêk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, lal chun a pâwl nawh a."
"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.","Chun, Haggith naupa Adonija chu ama le ama inchawisângin, “Kei hi lal ka la ni ngei âwm hi maw,” a ta, tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai, mi sâwmnga a hmaa tlân dinghai leh a buotsai a."
"And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.","A pa hlak chun ieng lai khawma, “Iengdinga hienga i thaw am a ni leh?” tiin a suklungawi naw ngai si nawh a; chun, ama hi hmêl ṭhatak a na, Absalom hnuoia mi a nih."
"And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.","Ama chun Zeruia naupa Joab le thiempu Abiathar chu a râwn a, anni chu Adonija tieng chun an ṭhang a, an ṭhangpui hlak a."
"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.","Thiempu Zadok hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Simei hai, Rei hai le David mi huoisenhai ruok chu Adonija tieng an ṭhang ve nawh a."
"And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants:","Chun, Adonija chun berâmhai, sebâwngchalhai, ran châwm thâuhai Zoheleth lungah a that a; chu chu En-rogel bula um a nih; chun, lal naupahai, a unauhai po po le, Juda rama lal upahai po po chu a fiel a."
"but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.","Zâwlnei Nathan hai, Benaia hai, mi huoisenhai le a unaupa Solomon ruok chu a fiel ve nawh a."
"Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?","Chuongchun, Nathan chun Solomon nu Bathseba kuoma chun, “Haggith naupa Adonija hi ei lalpa David hriet loin ân lal el a ni ta hi ti i hriet naw am a nih?"
"Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.","Chuongchun, nangma himna ding le i naupa Solomon himna ding lo hril ka ti che."
"Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?","Lal David kuoma chun va lût la, a kuomah, ‘Aw lalpa ka pu, i suoknu kuoma hin i naupa Solomon hi ka hnungah ân lal ngei ngei ding a na, ama hi ka lalṭhungphaa hin a la ṭhung ding a nih, ti khan ṭawng în khâm a ni naw am a ni kha?

"Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.","Ngai ta, lal i va biek lai tak chun kei khawma hung zui lût vêng ka ti cheh a, i thuhril chu ka hung sukdet- pui ding che a nih,” tiin a hril a."
And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.,"Chun, Bathseba chu lal pindana chun a va lût tah a, lal chu a upa ta hle el a, Sunam mi Abisag chun lal rawng chu a lo bâwl a."
"And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?","Bathseba chun kûnin lal chu chibai a bûk a. Chun, lal chun, “Ieng am i dit a?” a lo tih a."
"And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.","Ama chun, “Ka lalpa, LALPA i Pathien hming sâlin i suoknu kuoma hin, ‘I naupa Solomon hi ka hnungah ân lal ngei ngei ding a na, ama hi ka lalṭhungphaa hin a la ṭhung ding a nih,’ ti khan ṭawng în khâm tah a."
"And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:","Nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, tuhin Adonija chun ro a rêl ta hi, lalpa nang ka pu hlaka i hriet si nawh a;"
"and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.","bâwngchalhai, ran châwm thâuhai, berâmhai a that ṭeu a, lal naupahai po po le thiempu Abiathar le sipai pâwl hotu Joab a ko a; nisien- lakhawm, i siehlaw Solomon ruok hi chu a ko ve naw a nih."
"And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.","Chuongchun, ka pu lalpa hnunga hin lalṭhungphaah tu am a ṭhung ding a na ti i hril theina dingin Israelhai po po mit hi nang ka pu chunga hin a fu ṭhuop el a ni hi."
"Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.","Chuong naw chun chu hieng hi hung nîng a ta, ka pu lal hi a puhai kuoma a in ve pha chun, kei le ka naupa Solomon hi thil suksuoltuah an mi ruot el ding a ni hi,” a ta."
"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.","Chun, chuonga lal kuoma thu a la hril zing lai chun zâwlnei, Nathan chu a va lût veh a;"
"And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.","“En ta, zâwlnei Nathan a hung ie,” tiin lal chu an hril a. Chun, lal kuom a va tlung chun, lal hmaa chun a hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a."
"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?","Chun, Nathan chun, “Aw lalpa ka pu, ‘Keia hnungah Adonija hi inlal a ta, ka lalṭhungphaah ṭhung a tih,’ i ti am a nih?"
"For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, Long live king Adonijah.","Vawisûn hin a fe thlah a, ran châwm thâuhai, bâwngchalhai, be- râmhai a that ṭeu a, lal naupahai po po le sipai hotuhai le, thiempu Abiathar hai dâm a fiel a, chun, ngai ta, an dâwnin an fâk tâwl a, ‘Pathien chun lal Adonija hi humhim raw se,’ an ti a nih."
"But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.","Nisienlakhawm, kei i siehlaw ngei le, thiempu Zadok le Jehoiada naupa Benaia le i siehlaw Solomon hi chu an mi fiel ve nawh a."
"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?","Hi thil hi ka pu lalpa thilthaw a ni si chun, ka pu lalpa hnunga hin i lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding chu a tu tak am a ni i siehlawhai hi i lân hriettir naw hrim nîng a ti maw?” a ta."
"Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.","Chuongchun, lal David chun a dawn a, “Bathseba mi hung kopêk ro,” a tih a. Chun, lal kuoma chun a va feh a, lal hmaa chun a va ngîr a."
"And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,","Chun, lal chun ṭawng inkhâm- in, “Lunginzîngna po poa ka hringna humhimtu LALPA hringna sâlin,"
"verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.","i kuoma Israelhai LALPA hming sâla, ‘I naupa Solomon hi ka hnunga chun lân lal ngei ngei a ta, keia aiah ka lalṭhungphaa hin a la ṭhung ding a nih,’ tiha ṭawng kân khâm ang ngei khan, vawisûn ngei hin ka thaw ding a nih,” a ta."
"Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.","Chuongchun, Bathseba chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, lal chu chibai a bûk a, “Ka pu lal David hi kumkhawtluongin dam zing raw se,” a ta."
"And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.","Chun, lal David chun, “Thiempu Zadok hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai mi hung kopêk ro,” a ta. Chun, anni chu lal hmaa chun an va fe tah a."
"And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:","Chun, lal chun an kuomah, “In lalpa siehlawhai hi ṭhuoi unla, chun, ka naupa Solomon hi keima sabeng- tung lien chia ngei inchuongtir unla, Gihonah ṭhuoi thla ro,"
"and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, Long live king Solomon.","chun, chutaka chun thiempu Zadok le zâwlnei Nathanin ama chu Israelhai po po chunga lal dingin hriek zu nâl raw hai se, chun, in tawtawrâwthai mût in ta, ‘Pathienin lal Solomon hi humhim raw se,’ ti ro."
"Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.","Chuongchun, ama chu hung zui in ta, ka lalṭhungphaa hin a hung ṭhung ding a nih, ama hi ka aia lal ding a ni sih a; chun, ama hi Israel ram le Juda ram lal dinga ka ruot a nih,” a ta."
"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.","Chun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chun lal chu a dawn a, “Amen, LALPA ka pu lalpa Pathien khawma remti raw se."
"As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.","LALPA chu ka pu lalpa kuoma hin a um hlak angin, Solomon kuoma khawm um ve pei sienla, ka pu lal David lalṭhungpha nêkin a lalṭhung- pha chu sukropui lem raw se,” a ta."
"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.","Chuongchun, thiempu Zadok hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai, Kereth mihai, Peleth mihai chu an zu feh a, Solomon chu David sabengtung chunga chun an inchuongtir a, Gihon hmuna chun an ṭhuoi a."
"And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon.","Chun, thiempu Zadok chun Puon ina inthawkin hriek siena ki chu a lâk a, Solomon chu a nâl tah a. Chun, tawtawrâwt an mût a, chuong- chun, mi po po chun, “Pathienin lal Solomon hi humhim raw se,” an tih a."
"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.","Chun, mipuihai po po chun ama chu an zui a, mipuihai chun theihle dâm an mût a, an lâwm nasa khawp a, an rihâu chun hnuoi chu a nghawr kak hiel a."
"And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?","Chun, Adonija le mi fielhai a kuoma umhai po po chun an ruoiṭhe zo chun an hei hriet a. Chun, Joab chun tawtawrâwt mût rîk a hei hriet chun, “Khawpui sûnga ri nasatak um ta dur dur el chu iengtizie am a ni ta leh?” a ta."
"While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.","Chuonga a ti lai tak chun ngai ta, thiempu Abiathar naupa Jona- than a hung a, Adonija chun, “La hung ta khai, nang chu chu mi fel i na, chanchin ṭha intlun ngei i tih,” a lo tih a."
"And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:","Chun, Jonathan chun a dawn a, Adonija kuoma chun, “Tlun lo e, ei pu lal David chun Solomon lalah a siem tah annâwm ie,"
"and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;","ama ruol chun thiempu Zadok hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai, Kereth mihai, Peleth mihai lalin a tir a, lal sakawr chungah an inchuongtir tah a:"
"and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.","chun, thiempu Zadok le zâwlnei Nathanin Gihon hmunah lal dingin hriek an nâl tah a, chutaka inthawk chun hlimtakin an hung a, chu ri chun khawpui sûng chu a khâwk rum rum el a nih. Chu chu a nih in ri hriet chu."
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.,"Chun, Solomon chu hi ram lal- ṭhungphaa chun a ṭhung ta bawk a."
"And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.","Chun, lal siehlawhai chun, ‘I Pathienin i hming nêkin Solomon hming chu sukṭha sienla, i lalṭhung- pha nêkin Solomon a lalṭhungpha chu sukropui lem raw se,’ tiha ei lal David chu lâwmpui dingin an fe huoi huoi bawk a; chun, lal chu khum sikin a lo kûn pei bawk a."
"And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.","Chun, lal khawm chun hieng ang hin a tih a, ‘LALPA Israelhai Pathien, vawisûn ngeia ka lalṭhung- phaa ṭhung ding hung ruottu chu inpâkin um raw se, ka mit ngeiin a hmu ta hi, tiin,’” a ta."
"And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.","Chun, Adonija mi fielhai po po chun an ṭi tah a, an tho a, mâni lampui sengah an fe ta vawng a."
"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.","Chun, Adonija chun Solomon chu a ṭi tah a, a tho a, maichâm ki a va chel tah a."
"And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.","Chun, “Ngai ta, Adonija chun lal Solomon a ṭih a, ‘Lal Solomon hin a siehlaw kâwlhnâma sukhlum lo dingin ka kuomah ṭawng inkhâm phawt raw se,’ tiin maichâm ki a chel ie,” tiin Solomon chu an hril a."
"And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.","Solomon chun, “Mi ringumtak a ni ti a suklang phawt chun a sam zâi khat khawm hnuoiah tla naw nih, amiruokchu, rîtlona a nei ti hriet a ni ruok chun thîng a tih,” a ta."
"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun mi a tir a, maichâma inthawk chun an va ṭhuoi tah a. Chun, a va feh a, Solomon chu chibai a bûk a, Solomon chun a kuomah, “I inah fe ta raw khai,” a lo tih a."
"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.","Chun, LALPA hming dinga a thilthaw chungchâng thua Solomon hming inthangzie chu Seba lalnuin a lo hriet chun thu khirtak taka fie tumin a kuomah a feh a."
"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.","Chun, Jerusalem khuoah, hnung zuitu tamtak ṭhuoiin, thil rim inhnik le rângkachak tamtak le lunghluhai phur sanghâwngseihai ṭhuoiin a feh a; chun, Solomon kuom a tlung chun a lungrila a thu pai po po chu phawr fai rêtin ama a biek a."
And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.,"Chun, Solomon chun a thu in- dawnhai po po chu a dawn fai vawng a, lal ihriet naw, a hrilfie thei naw hrim a um dêr nawh a."
"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,","Chun, Seba lalnuin Solomon varzie po pohai, a in bâwl dâm,"
"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.","a dawkâna fâk ding dâm, a upahai ṭhung dân dâm, a rawngbâwl- tuhai chângvêl dân dâm, an inchei dân dâm, a no inhlântuhai dâm, LALPA ina ân hlân pumrawhmang thilinhlâna ân hlânhai a hei hmu chun lungril alêm a nei ta nawh a."
"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.","Chuongchun, lal kuoma chun, “I thilthawhai le i varzie hai, keia rama inthawka ka lo hriethai kha thuthang indik tak a lo ni ngei hi tie."
"Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.","Nisienlakhawm, keiin ka mit ngeia ka hung hmu hmakhat chun an hril chu ka lo awi nawh a, chuong- chun, ngai ta, a zâtve khawm an mi lo hril naw a nih, an hril ka lo hriet nêkin i varzie le i ṭhatzie a lo nasa hle lem a ni hi."
"Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.","I mihai, hieng i siehlaw, i bula um rawpa i varna thu ngai zing zing hlakhai hi an va hamṭha de aw!"
"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.","LALPA i Pathien, i chunga lâwm êm êm, Israelhai lalṭhungphaa in- ṭhungtirtu che hi inpâkin um raw se; LALPAIN kumkhuoin Israelhai hi a hmangai a, chuleiin, feltaka ro rêl dingin lalah a siem che a ni hi,” a ta."
"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.","Chun, lal chu rângkachak ta- lent za le sâwmhni le thil riminhnik tamtak el le, lunghluhai a pêk a, Seba lalnuin Solomon thil riminhnik a pêk ang zozaia tam hi a lût ta ngai nawh a."
"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.","Chun, Hiram lawngruol, Ophira inthawka rângkachak va phurtuhai khawm chun Ophira inthawk chun almug thing tamtak le lunghluhai an hung phur a."
"And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.","Chun, lal chun almug thinghai chu LALPA in le lal in inhuonna dingin le hlasaktuhai ta dinga ṭing- ṭang le perkhuonghai siemna ding chenin a hmang a; tu chen hin chuong ang almug thing hrim hrim chu a lûtin hmu khawm hmu a ni ta ngai nawh."
"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.","Chun, a hni sa naw Solomonin a pêk tihai naw khawm chu lal Solomon chun Seba lalnu chu a dit taphawt, a hni taphawthai chu a pêk a. Chuongchun, a rawihai leh a umna ram tieng chun a fe nâwk tah a."
"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,","Solomon kuoma kum khat sûnga rângkachak lût rikzie chu, rângkachak talent za ruk sâwmruk paruk a nih;"
"besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.","sumdâwngtuhaia inthawka sie- chawi lâklût le, thil zawrtuhai suk- hlâwk, Arab lalhai sie-chawi po po le ram awptuhaia inthawka lût tiem loin."
And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.,"Chun, lal Solomon chun rângka- chak sut phêkin phaw lien za hni a siem a, phaw pakhat chun shekel za ruk a dit a nih."
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.,"Chun, rângkachak sut phêkin phaw dang za thum a siem a, phaw pakhat chun rângkachak maneh thum pei a ngai a; chuonghai chu lal chun Lebanon rampui ina chun a sieh a."
"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.","Chun, lal chun saiha lal- ṭhungpha ropuitak a siem bawk a, chu chu rângkachak ṭha chi takin ân luon a."
"There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.","Lalṭhungpha hang lâwnnaa chun kalbi paruk a um a, chu lal- ṭhungpha hnungtieng chun a hung inkûm a, a ṭhungna sîrtuoka chun a dona a um ve veh a, chun a dona bulhaia chun sakeibaknei pahni an ngîr a."
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.,"Chun, kalbi paruka chun a sîrtuokah sakeibaknei sâwm le pahni an ngîr a, chuong ang chu khâwlai rama khawm an siem ngai hrim hrim nawh a."
"And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.","Chun, lal Solomon nohai po po chu rângkachak vawng an na, chun, Lebanon Rampui Ina bûr le bêlhai po po khawm chu rângkachak hlîr hlak vawng an nih; tangkaruo hrim hrim a ṭhang nawh, Solomon dam lai chun, chu chu ieng hûa khawm an ngai nawh."
"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.","Lal chun tuisuorieta chun Hiram lawng ruol inkawppuitu ding Tarsis lawng ruol a nei a, Tarsis lawng ruol chun kum thum dan peiah rângkachak dâm, tangkaruo dâm, saiha dâm, zâwng dâm, ârâwnhai dâm, a hung phur hlak a."
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.,"Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun khawvêla lal po po chu hausaka le vara chun a khûm vawng a nih."
"And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.",Pathienin a lungrila varna thu a siepêk chu ngai dingin khawvêla mi po pohai chun Solomon chu an hung pan huoi huoi hlak a.
"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.","Mi tinin lâwmman kum tina pêk bi neiin tangkaraw bûr le bêlhai, rângkachak bûr le bêlhai, puonhai dâm, râlthuomhai dâm, thil rimin- hnikhai dâm, sakawrhai dâm, sa- bengtung lien chi hai dâm an hung pêk hlak a."
"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.","Chun, Solomon chun tawlai- lîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai a ko khâwm ṭeu a, tawlailîr sâng khat le za li le sakawr chung chuong mi sîng khat le sâng hni a nei a, chuonghai chu tawlailîr siena khuo- haia, Jerusalem khuoa lal umnaa dâm chun ân umtir a."
"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.","Chun, lal chun Jerusalem khuoa chun a tam êm leiin tangka- ruohai chu lung ang ela ngai khawpin ân umtir a, Sidar thinghai dâm chu phaia theichang thing ang ela ngai khawpin ân umtir a."

"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.","Chun, ama ruolpui tlangvâlhai chun a kuomah, “Hieng mipuihai, ‘I pa khan kan rîngkawl a sukrik êm hlak a, nang chun chu mi sukzângpêk raw khai,’ i kuoma tituhai kuoma chun, hieng ang hin ti la, hieng ang hin an kuoma chun hril rawh, ‘Ka pa kâwng nêk chun ka kutte khawm hi a lien lem a."

"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.","Chun, chu ni ma chun inchikna a pêk a, “Hi hi LALPAIN inchikna ding a ti chu a nih, ‘Ngai ta, maichâm hi la kawi phawk a ta, a chunga meivâm- hai hi lân baw vawng a tih,’ ti hi,” tiin."
"And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.","Chun, Pathien miin Bethela maichâm a hang hrângkhum lalin a lo hriet chun, Jeroboam chun, “Man ro,” tiin maichâma inthawk chun a kutin a hei ban a. Chun, man tuma a banna kut chu a hung zeng tah a, chuongchun, a kut chu a lâk nâwk thei ta nawh a."
"The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.","Pathien miin LALPA thua in- chikna ding a hril ang khan maichâm khawm chu a kawi phawk a, mai- châma meivâmhai chu ân baw ta vawng a."
"And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, Pathien mi kuoma chun, “Ka kut hi a hung dam nâwk theina dingin LALPA i Pathien ngên la, mi ṭawngṭaipêk ta khai,” a ta. Chun, Pathien mi chun LALPA kuoma chun a ngên a; chun, lal kut chu a hung dam nâwk tah a, a hma ang bawkin a hung um nâwk tah a."
"And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.","Chuongchun, lal chun Pathien mi kuoma chun, “Ka in tieng ka kuomah hung la, va châwl hadam hri raw khai, chun, lâwmman khawm ka pêk ding che annâwm,” a ta."
"And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;","Chun, Pathien mi chun lal kuom- ah, “I insûng zâtve khawm mi pe ding ni la, i kuoma chun hung chuong naw ning ah, hi hmuna hin bei ka fâkin tui hrim hrim khawm ka dâwn ding a ni nawh;"
"for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.","‘Bei va fain, tui hrim hrim khawm va dâwn naw la, i va fena lampuia khawm kîr nâwk ta naw rawh,’ tia LALPA thua tir ka nih i sawnnaw,” a ta."
"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.","Chuongchun, lampui dangah a feh a, Bethel hung pana a hungna lampuia chun a fe nâwk ta nawh a."
"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father.","Chuong lai chun Bethel khuoa chun zâwlnei tar pakhat hi a um a, a naupasalhai chun chu nia Bethela Pathien mi thilthawhai po po chu ama chu an hril vawng a; lal kuoma a thu hril khawm chu an pa an hril a."
"And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah.","Chun, an pa chun an kuomah, “Khaw tieng lampui am a fe ta leh?” a ta. A naupasalhai chun Juda rama inthawka hung Pathien mi fe nâwkna lampui chu an khîkhmuh a."
"And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.","Chuongchun, a naupasalhai kuomah, “Sabengtung mi hung siem- pêk ta u,” a ta. Chuongchun, sabeng- tung chu an siempêk a, a chuong tah a."
"And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.","Chun, Pathien mi chu a hnawt tah a, thingsaisaw hnuoia ṭhung hi a va hmuh a, a kuomah, “Nang hi i ni maw Juda rama inthawka hung Pathien mi chu?” a ta.

"Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.","Chuongchun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ka in tieng ka kuomah hung la, bei va fa raw khai,” a ta."
"And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:","Chun, ama chun, “I ruola kîr nâwk thei ka ni nawh a, i kuoma hung thei khawm ka ni bawk nawh; hi hmuna hin i kuomah bei fa naw ning a, tui hrim hrim khawm dâwn naw ning ah."
"for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.","‘Bei va fain tui hrim hrim khawm va dâwn naw la, i va fena lampuia khawm kîr nâwk ta naw rawh,’ tiha, LALPA thua hril ka ni sih a” a ta."
"And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Kei khawm nanga ang bawka zâwlnei ka ni annâwm, vântirkoin, LALPA thuin, ‘Bei dâm fah a, tui dâm dâwn dingin i in tieng ṭhuoikîr nâwk raw khai,’ tiin a mi biek i sawnnaw,” a ta.

"So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.","Chuongchun, a kuoma chun a kîr ve nâwk a, a ina chun bei dâm a fâkin tui dâm a dâwn tah a."
"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back;","Chun, dawkân an awt lai chun a ṭhuoi kîrtu zâwlnei kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a;"
"and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,","Juda rama inthawka hung Pathien mi kuoma chun, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, LALPA thuhril i awi nawh a, LALPA i Pathienin thu a pêk che i pawm naw lei le,"
"but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.","i hung kîr nâwk a, ‘Bei va fain, tui hrim hrim khawm va dâwn naw rawh,’ a tina hmun ngeiah, bei i fâk a, tui dâm i dâwn leiin i ruong hi i puhai thlâna sie ni ve naw nih, tiin,” tiin a hril suok tah a."
"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.","Chun, bei dâm a fâk a, tui dâm a dâwn zo chun zâwlnei a ṭhuoi kîr nâwk chu sabengtung a siem- pêk a."
"And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.","Chun, a fe chu lampuia chun sakeibaknei leh an intuok tah a; a lo se tah a; a ruong chu lampuia chun inthal dêr hin a um a, sabengtung chu a kâwla chun a ngîr a, sakeibaknei khawm chu ruong bula chun a ngîr ve zing a."
"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.","Chun, ngai ta, mihai an va feh a, lampuia ruong inthal dêra um le, ruong bula sakeibaknei ngîr zing chu an va hmuh a, zâwlnei tartak umna khuoa chun an va hril a."
"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake unto him.","Chun, lampuia va ṭhuoi kîr nâwktu zâwlnei chun chu thu chu a lo hriet phing chun, “Pathien mi, LALPA thu hril awi nuom nawpa kha a ni chu; LALPAIN a kuoma a hril, a thu ang peiin, LALPAIN sakeibaknei kuomah a pêk a, a lo ham a, a se hlum tah a ni chu,” a ta."
"And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it.","Chun, a naupasalhai kuoma chun, “Sabengtung mi siemrêlpêk ta u,” tiin a hril a. Chun, an siempêk tah a."
"And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass.","Chun, a fe tah a, a ruong lampuia inthal dêra lo um le, sabeng- tung le sakeibaknei ruong bula lo ngîr zing chu a va hmuh a; sakeibaknei chun ruong chu a lo la fâk nawh a, sabengtung khawm chu a lo la sukpawp naw bawk a."
"And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.","Chun, zâwlnei chun Pathien mi ruong chu ân hlawm a, sabengtung chunga chun a sie kai a, a kîrpui nâwk tah a; chuongchun, zâwlnei putar umna khuoa chun sûn ding le vûi dingin a lût tah a."
"And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!","Chun, a ruong chu ama thlâna chun ân zâl a, chuongchun, “A va pawi ngei maw, ka unaupa,” tiin a ṭah a."
"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.","Chun, a vûi hnung chun a nau- pasalhai kuomah, “Ka thi pha chun Pathien mi phûmna thlâna hin mi hung phûm ve unla; a ru bula chun ka ruhai hi hung sie unla."
"For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.","Pathien thua Bethela maichâm le, Samari ram khawpuihaia bâwl- hmun inhai po po a hrângkhumna thu kha hung tlung ngei ngei ding a ni sih a,” tiin a hril a."
"After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.","Chuong thil hnunga khawm chun Jeroboam chun a umdân indik- naw chu a la bân chuong nawh a, vântlâng laia mihai bâwlhmun thiempu dingin a la siem ta rawp a; bâwlhmun thiempuhai an um theina dingin a nuom taphawthai chu a la suktum ta rawp a."
"And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.","Chun, thil chu Jeroboam sûng- kuo suolna, anni ngei sukchimittu le khawvêla inthawka sukbohmang hlautu a hung ni tah a."
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.,Chuong lai chun Jeroboam naupa Abija chu a damnawh a.
"And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spake concerning me that I should be king over this people.","Chun, Jeroboam chun a nuhmei kuomah, “Tho la, Jeroboam nuhmei a nih ti an hriet nawna ding chein insukdanglam la, Silo-ah va fe ta khai; ngai ta, chutaka chun zâwlnei Ahija, hieng mihai chunga lala ka la um dingzie, ka chungchâng thu hriltu kha a um ie."
"And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.","Beiphêk sâwm le, bei tlang chitê tê, khuoizu bûr khat leh chawi la, a kuomah va fe ta, naupang um dân ding chu lo hril a ti che,” a ta."
"And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.","Chun, Jeroboam nuhmei chun chuong ang chun a thawh a, a tho a, Silo-a chun a feh a, Ahija ina chun a va fe tah a, Ahija chun khuo khawm a hmu thei ta nawh a, a upat leiin a mit ân thim sih a."
"And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.","Chun, LALPAIN Ahija kuomah, “Ngai ta, Jeroboam nuhmei a naupa chungchâng thua râwn ding chein a hung a; a damnaw a na, hieng ang hin lo hril rawh; hieng ang hi nîng a ta, a hung lût pha chun, nuhmei dang ni âwmtakin a hung insiem ding a nih,” a ta."
"And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.","Chun, Ahija chun chuonga kawt- khâra a hung lût laia a ke sir ri a hei hriet phing chun, “Nang Jeroboam nuhmei, hung lût raw khai, iengtiziea mi danga insiem am i nih a?

"Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,","Fe nâwk ta la, Jeroboam kuom- ah, ‘LALPA Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih, Mipuihaia inthawk hin ka dawmsâng cheh a, ka mi Israelhai chunga hin hotuah ka siem cheh a,"
"and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,","David sûnghai ram ka lâkpêk a, chu chu ka pêk cheh a; nisienla- khawm, nang chu ka siehlaw David angin i um ve nawh a; ama chun chu ka thupêkhai a pawm a, ka mithmua thilṭha chau thaw tumin a lungril po poin a mi zui hlak a;"
"but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:","nang ruok chun chu i hmaa mihai po po nêkin thil i suksuol nasa bîk a, mi suklunginsenna dingin pathien danghai le milim sunghai i siem a, hnung i mîn nghatsan tah a,"
"therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone.","chuleiin, ngai ta, Jeroboam sûng- kuo chunga hin thil ṭha naw hung intlungtir ka ta.

Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it.,"Jeroboam sûngkuo laia mi, khawpuia thi taphawthai chu uiin fâng an ta; rama thi taphawthai chu chunglêng vatehaiin fâng an tih; chu chu LALPAIN a hril tah a nih,’ ti rawh."
"Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.","Chuongchun, tho la, i in tieng fe nâwk el rawh, khawpui sûng i sir phingleh naupang chu a thi ding a nih."
"And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po chun sûn an ta, vui an tih; Jeroboam sûngkuo lai chun ama chau chu thlâna sie ding a ni ding a ni sih a; Jeroboam sûngkuo lai hin ama chaua hin LALPA Israelhai Pathien chunga ṭhatna ieng amanih ân lang leiin."
"Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.","Chun, LALPAIN tu ela Jero- boam sûngkuo hung sukbohmangtu ding Israelhai chunga lal siem a ta; tuta inthawk ngei hin."
"For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger.","LALPA chun tuia phairuong kûng inhnîng inhnîng angin Israelhai chu hung vaw hnîng a ta; chuong- chun, LALPA lung suksena an Aserahai chu an siem leiin, an puhai a lo pêk tah, hi ram ṭhataka inthawk hin Israelhai chu la keidawk fai vawng a ta, vadung khêl tienga chun la sukdar vawng a tih."
"And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.","Chun, Israelhai chu thil insuk- suoltira a thaw Jeroboam suolnahai leiin Israelhai chu nghatsan a tih,” a ta."
"And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.","Chun, Jeroboam nuhmei chu a tho a, a suok tah a, Tirza khuo chu a va tlung a, chun, in kawtkhâr bul a va tlung phingle chun naupang chu a thi tah a."
"And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the prophet.","Chun, LALPAIN a siehlaw zâwlnei Ahija hmanga thu a lo hril ta ang ngei khan Israelhai po po chun an sûn a, an vui tah a."
"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.","Jeroboam chanchin dang, a râl do thu le a rorêl thu chu, ngai ta, Israelhai lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a."
"And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Jeroboam rorêl sûng chu kum sâwmhni le kum hni a na; chun, a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, a naupa Nadab chu a aiawin ân lal tah a."
"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.","Chun, Solomon naupa Reho- boam chu Judai ramah ân lal a.

"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;","Chun, lal Rehoboam inlal kum nga kum chun Aigupta ram lal Sisak chun Jerusalem khuo chu a hang rûn a."
"and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.","LALPA ina rohai le lal rohai chu a lâk a, a rêng el chun a lâk fai vawng a; Solomon rângkachak phaw siem po po khawm kha a lâksa vawng a."
"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun chuong aia chun dâr phawhai a siem a, lal in kawtkhâr vêngtu hotuhai ân kawltir a."
"And it was so, that, as oft as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.","Chun, lal chu LALPA ina a lût po leh vêngtuhai chun an chawi a; chun, vêngtuhai pindana chun an sie nâwk pei hlak a."

And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.,"Chun, Jeroboam le Rehoboam chu indo zing zingin an um hlak a."
"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Rehoboam chu a puhai kuomah a in tah a, David khawpuia a puhai kuoma chun an phûm tah a; a nu hming chu Naama, Ammon mi a nih.

Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.,Tûn Nebat naupa lal Jeroboam chu kum sâwm le kum riet ân lal kum chun Judahai chungah Abijam chu ân lal ṭan a.
Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.,"Jerusalem khuoah kum thum ân lal a, a nu hming chu Maaka, Abisa- lom naunu a nih."
"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.",A hmaa a pain thil suol a thawhai po po kha a thaw veh a; a pu David lungril angin a lungril chu LALPA a Pathien tienga chun a ṭha famkim ve nawh a.

Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.,Rehoboam chu a dam sûng po chu Jeroboam leh an indo zing zing hlak a.
"And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.",Abijam chanchin le a thilthaw danghai po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.,"Abijam le Jeroboam chu an indo hlak a. Chun, Abijam chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, David khaw- puia chun an phûm tah a; ama aiawin a naupa Asa chu ân lal tah a."
And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.,Israel lal Jeroboam chu kum sâwmhni ân lal kum chun Asa chu Judahai chungah ân lal ṭan a.
And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.,"Chun, kum sâwmli le kum khat chu Jerusalemah ân lal a, a pi hming chu Maaka, Abisalom naunu a nih."
"And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did David his father.",Asa chun a pu David ang bawkin LALPA mithmua thilṭha a thaw hlak a.
"And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.","Chun, pasal inzawrhai chu a rama inthawkin a hnawt suok a, a puhaiin milim an lo siemhai po po chu a sukbo vawng a."
"And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.","A pi Maaka khawm chu milim tirdakumtak Asera a siempêk leiin, a lalnu nina chu a bân a; chun, Asa chun a milim siem chu a sât thlûk a, Kidron vadungah a rawh a."
But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.,"Bâwlhmunhai ruok chu a sukbo nawh a, nisienlakhawm, Asa lungril chu a dam sûng po chun LALPA tieng chun a ṭha famkim a nih."
"And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.","Chun, a pain thil a lo inhlân tasahai le ama ngeiin a lo inhlân tah, tangkaruohai, rângkachak dâm, bûr le bêlhai chu LALPA inah a lâk lût a."
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.,"Chun, Asa le Israel lal Baasa chu an inlal sûng po chu an indo zing hlak a."
"And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.","Israel lal Baasa chun Judahai chu a hang thawh a, Juda lal Asa kuoma lût ding le suok ding dangna dingin Rama khuo a siem a."
"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,","Chuongchun, Asa chun LALPA ina le lal ina ro la um tangkaruo le rângkachak po po chu a lâk a, a siehlawhai a pêk a; chun, lal Asa chun Damaska khuoa um Suria lal Hezion nau Tabrimon naupa Ben- hadad kuoma chun,"
"There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.","“Nang le keia kâra le ka pa le i pa kârah thuthlung a um a, ngai ta, lâwmman dingin tangkaruo le râng- kachak ka hung thawn che; thaw ta, Israel lal Baasa hin a min kiensanna dingin a kuoma i thuthlung kha ṭhiek el ta,” tiin a thawn a."
"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.","Chun, Benhadad chun lal Asa thu chu a lo pawm a, chuongchun, Israel khuohai chu thaw dingin a sipai hotuhai a tir a.

"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.","Chun, Baasa chun chu thu chu a lo hriet phingleh Rama khaw siem chu a ma a, Tirza khuoa chun a um tah a."
"Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.","Chuongchun, lal Asa chun Judai ram po poa chun thu ân phur vêl tah a; tukhawm a âwl bîk hrim hrim an um nawh, chuongchun, Baasain Rama khaw siemna dinga thing le lung a hmanghai chu an thak a; chuonghai chu hmangin lal Asa chun Mizpa khuo le Benjamin rama Geba khuo a siem a."
"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.","Asa chanchin dang po pohai, a thilthawtheizie po pohai, a thilthaw po pohai, a khaw siemhai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?

"And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Asa chu a puhai kuomah a in tah a, a pu David khawpuiah a puhai lai chun an phûm tah a; a naupa Jehosaphat chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.,"Chun, Jeroboam naupa Nadab chu Juda lal Asa inlal kum hninaa chun Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a; Israelhai chunga chun kum hni ân lal a."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.","LALPA mithmuin thil ṭha naw- tak a thaw hlak a; a pa lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a suksuolna kha a thaw veh a."
"And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.","Chun, Issakar sûnghai laia mi Ahija naupa Baasa chun ama chu a phier rûk a, Philistin mihai chan, Gibbethon khuoah Baasa chun a that tah a, Nadab le Israelhai po po chun Gibbethon khuo chu an inhuol lai tak a nih."
"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.","Juda lal Asa inlal a kum thumnaah a nih Baasa chun a that a, a aiah ân lal chu."
"And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;","Chun, lal a hung ni phing chun a sukchimit dêr hmakhat chun Jeroboam sûnghai po po chu a that a, a dam taphawt chu pakhat khawm Jeroboam chu a hlapêk nawh a; LALPAIN Shilo khuoa mi a siehlaw Ahija hmanga a lo hril ta ang khan,"

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.,"Chun, Asa le Israel lal Baasa chu an inlal sûng po chu an indo zing hlak a."
"In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty and four years.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum thumnaa chun Ahija naupa Baasa chu Tirza khuoah Israelhai po po chungah ân lal ṭan a, kum sâwmhni le kum li ân lal a."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.","LALPA mithmuin thil ṭhanaw- tak a thaw hlak a, Jeroboam lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltirnaa a suksuolna kha a thaw veh a."
"And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,","Chun, Baasa chungchâng thuah Hanani naupa Jehu kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a,"
"Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;","“Pilvuta inthawkin ka dawm sâng cheh a, ka mi Israelhai chunga hin hotuah ka siem cheh a, chun, nangin Jeroboam lampui hraw chu i hrawh a, an suolnahaia an mi suklungsenna dingin ka mi Israelhai chu thil în suksuoltir a;"
"behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","ngai ta, Baasa le a sûnghai hi ka sukbo hlau ding a nih; chuongchun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam sûnghai ang elin i sûnghai hi siem ka tih."
Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.,"Baasa sûngkuohai laia khawpuia thi taphawthai chu uiin fâng an ta, chun, a sûngkuo laia mi rama thi taphawthai chu chunglêng vatehaiin fâng an tih,” tiin."
"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Baasa chanchin danghai, a thilthaw dâm, a thilthawtheizie dâm chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Baasa chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, Tirza khuoah an phûm a; a naupa Ela chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
"And moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Jehovah against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.","Chun, Baasa le a sûngkuohai chungchâng thua chun a kutsuoka LALPA suklungsenna dinga Jero- boam sûnghai hawina neia LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtak a thaw lei le, ama chu a that leiin Hanani naupa zâwlnei Jehu hmanga a hril LALPA thu chu a hung tlung tah a."
"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwmhni le kum ruknaah Baasa naupa Ela chu Tirza khuoa Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a, kum hni sûng ân lal a."
"And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:","Chun, a siehlaw Zimri, a taw- lailîr zâtve chunga hotuin ama chu a phier rûk a, chuong lai chun Tirza khuoa chun, Tirza khuoa a insûng tieng hotu Arza inah a lo dâwn in- rui a;"

"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.","Chun, ama chu a hang inlal ṭan a, a lalṭhungphaa a hang ṭhung phingle chun, Baasa sûnghai po po chu a that vawng a, a laibunghai le a ruolhai laia mi naupasal taphawt chu pakhat khawm a hla nawh."
"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,","Chuongchun, zâwlnei Jehu hmanga Baasa chungchâng thu a lo hril ta ang khan, Zimri chun Baasa sûnghai po po chu a sukchimit vawng tah a;"

"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwmhni le kum sari kum chun Zimri chu Tirza khuoa chun ni sari ân lal a. Philistin mihai chan, Gibbethon khuo chu mihai chun an inhuol a."
"And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.","Chun, ân huoltuhai chun, Zimri chun lal a phier rûk a, lal a that tah ti mi hril an lo hriet a; chuong- chun, Israelhai po po chun sipai ho- tu Omri chu, chu ni chun an riek- hmuna Israelhai lal dingin an siem tah a."

"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,","Chun, Zimri chun khuo chu an lâk tah ti a hriet chun, lal ina kula chun a tlânlût a, lal ina chun ân râwkhum a, a thi tah a."

"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.","Chuongchun, Israel mipuihai chu pâwl hniah an hung inṭhe tah a, mipui zâtve chun Ginath naupa Tibni chu lala siem tumin an zui a; chun, a zâtvein Omri chu an zui bawk a."
"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.","Nisienlakhawm, Omri zuituhai chun Ginath naupa Tibni zuituhai chu an hne tah a, chuongchun, Tibni chu a thih a, Omri chu ân lal tah a."
"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwm- thum le kum khatnaah Omri chu Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a, kum sâwm le kum hni sûng ân lal a; Tirza khuoa chun kum ruk ân lal a."
"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.","Semer ta Samari tlâng chu tangka talent hniin ân châwk a; chun, tlânga chun khuo a siem a; a khaw siem hminga chun chu tlâng neitu Semer hming chawiin Samari ân puttir a."

And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.,"Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwm- thum le kum rietnaah Omri naupa Ahab chu Israel chungah ân lal ṭan a; chun, Omri naupa Ahab chu Samari khuoa chun Israelhai chungah kum sâwmhni le kum hni ân lal a."

"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.","Chun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolna ang thaw ve dâm chu ienga khawm ngailo ni âwmtakin, Zidon mihai lal Ethbaal naunu Jezebel nuhmeiah a nei a; Baal rawng dâm bâwlsanin a biek ve ta el a."
"And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.",Samari khuoa Baal in a bâwla chun Baal ta dingin maichâm a siem tah a.
"And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.","Chun, Ahab chun Asera a siem a; a hmaa Israel lalhai po po nêkin Ahab chun LALPA Israelhai Pathien suklungsenna dingin thil a thaw nasa bîk a nih."
"In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.","Ama ân lal lai chun Bethel mi Hielin Jeriko khuo a siem a, a nau- lutîr Abiram chu chânin a lungphûm chu a phûm a; chun, a nau mitlum Segub chu chânin a kul kawtkhâr- hai chu ân ngîr a, LALPAIN Nun naupa Josua hmanga a lo hril ta ang khan."
"And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.","Tisbe khuo, Gilead rama Tisbe khuoa mi Elija chun Ahab kuoma chun, “LALPA, a hmaa ka ngîrna hlak, Israelhai Pathien hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih; kum ieng zât amani sûng chu ka thu naw chun ruo le dâidaw tla hrim hrim naw nih,” a ta."

"Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.","“Hitaka inthawk hi suok la, khawsak tieng panin fe la, Jordan bula um Kerith vadunga chun hang inbihmang rawh."
"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.","Chun, chu vadung tui chu tlân i ta, chutaka châwm ding chein vaâkhai thu ka pêk tah a nih,” tiin."
"So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.","Chuongchun, a feh a, LALPA thu ang chun a thaw tah a; Jordan kâwla um Kerith vadunga chun a hang um tah a."
"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.","Chun, vaâkhai chun zîngkâr hin bei le sâ an hung putpêk hlak a; zântieng chun bei le sâ an hung putpêk nâwk hlak a, chun, vadung tui chu a tlân a."

"And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu a kuomah a hung tlung a;"
"Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.","Tho la, Zidon rama Zarephath khuoah fe la, chutaka chun um rawh; ngai ta, a châwm ding chein hmeithai pakhat thu ka pêk tah,tiin."
"So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.","Chuongchun, a tho a, Zarephath khuoa chun a fe tah a; chun, chu khaw kul kawtkhâr chu a va tlung chun, ngai ta, hmeithai pakhat thing inkhâwm hi a lo um a; ama chu a hang ko a, bêlin tui tlâwmte mi hung lapêk ta, hang dâwn ka tih,a ta."

"And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.","Ama chun, LALPA i Pathien hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, bei chu chu ka nei nawh a, bêla beiphit vei- khat bak le, bûrah sahriek tlâwmte chau ka nei a; chun, ngai ta, ka feh a, kei le ka naupa ta dinga siemna dingin thingrieu pahni amani chau kân khâwm a na; chuongchun, chu chu fâng kan ta, kan thi el ding a nih,a ta."
"And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.","Chun, Elija chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, i hril ang chun va thaw phawt la, amiruokchu, chu chun bei chite bêk mi hung siempêk phawt la, chu chu mi hung chawipêk la, chu zoa chun i ta ding le i naupa ta ding chu i la siem ding annâwm."
"For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth.","LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘LALPAIN hnuoi chunga hin ruo a hung insûrtir hmakhat chun bei phit bêl chu ruok chuong naw nih a, sahriek bûr khawm kang naw nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.","Chuongchun, Elija hril ang chun a va thawh a, chun, ama le a sûnghai le Elija le chun ni iengzât lai sûng amanih an ring a."
"The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Elijah.","Elija hmanga a hril LALPA thu ang khan, beiphit bêl chu a ruok chuong nawh a, sahriek bûr khawm chu a kang bawk nawh."
"And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.","Chun, chuong thil hnunga chun in neitunu, hmeithai naupa chu a na tah a; a na chu a na hle el a; a thuok a tâwp tah a."

"And he said unto her, Give me thy son.

"And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?","Chun, LALPA chu a ko a, “Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka umna hmei- thainu chunga hin a naupa hi suk- hlumpêkin thil ṭha naw khawm i hung intlungtir a ni maw?” a ta."
"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.","Chuongchun, naupang chunga chun vawi thum a bawk a, LALPA chu a ko a, “Aw LALPA ka Pathien, lunginsiettakin hi naupang hringna hi amaa hin hung inumtir nâwk rawh,” a ta."

"And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.","Elija chun naupang chu a ṭhuoi a, pindana inthawk chun in sûngah a fe thlâkpui a, a nu a pêk tah a; Elija chun, “En ta, i naupa hi a dam nâwk tah,” a ta."
"And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth.","Nuhmei chun Elija kuoma chun, “Tu zet hin chu Pathien mi i na, i baua LALPA thu hi thutak a nih ti ka hung hriet tah,” a ta."
"And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.","Chun, ni tamtak hnunga chun, a kum thum kuma chun LAL- PA thu chu Elija kuomah a hung tlung a, “Va fe la, Ahab kuomah vân lang rawh; chuongchun, hnuoi chung- a hin ruo hung insûrtir ka tih,” tiin."
And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.,"Chun, Elija chu Ahab kuoma inlangtir ding chun a fe tah a. Samari rama chun ṭâm chu a nasa hle el a."
"And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:","Chun, Ahab chun Obadia, a insûng tieng hotu chu a ko a, (Obadia chu LALPA ṭi mi tak a na,"
"for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)","Jezebelin LALPA zâwlneihai a râwt rak lai khan Obadia chun zâwl- nei za a ṭhuoi a, pûkah sâwmnga peiin a thuphmang a, bei le tuiin a châwm hlak a nih.)"
"And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.","Chun, Ahab chun Obadia kuoma chun, “Tuihnâr po po le varuom umna po po va fang ta khai; sakawrhai le sabengtung lien chi hai hi ei sandam theina dingin hlobet dâm ei hmupêk thei el rawi mawh; chuong naw chun chu ranhai hi chân vawng rawi ei tih,” a ta."
"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.","Chuongchun, ram fang suok ding chu an insem a, Ahab chu a khâtin lampui dangah a feh a; Obadia khawm chu a khâtin lampui dangah a feh a."
"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?","Chun, chuonga Obadia a fe lai chun, ngai ta, Elija le chun an intuok a; ama chun a la hriet a; chuongchun, a bawkkhup a, “Nang i ni maw, ka pu Elija?” a ta."

"And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?","Chun, ama chun, “Thil ieng am ka suksuol a, i siehlaw hi that dinga Ahab kuta pêk i nuom el am a nih a?"
"As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.","LALPA i Pathien hringna sâlin ka hril a nih; ka pu hin nangma inzawngtir nawna hnam le ram hrim hrim a nei nawh i sawnnaw, ‘Hitaka hin a um nawh,’ an ti chun, an hmu naw che thuah ram le hnam chu ṭawng ân khâmtir pei a na."
"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.","Tuhin nangin, ‘Fe la, ngai ta, Elija sawtaka sawn a um ie, tiin i pu va hril rawh,’ i ti el a."
"And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.","Ka mâksan phing che hin LALPA thlarauin ka hriet nawnaah la hmang sîng a ti cheh a, chuong- chun, Ahab chu ka va hril a, a hung hmu thei si naw che chun a mi that el ding i sawnnaw; nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw hin ka tleirawla inthawk tah LALPA chu ka ṭi hlak sih a."
"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?","Jezebelin LALPA zâwlneihai a râwt rak laia ka thil thaw, LALPA zâwlneihai laia mi za, sâwmnga pâwla pûka ka thuphmang a, bei le tuia ka châwmzie kha ka pu hi an hril naw che nîng a ti maw?"

"And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.","Elija chun, “A hmaa ka ngîrna hlak sipaihai LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, vawisûn hin a kuomah kân lang ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.","Chuongchun, Obadia chu Ahab va be ding chun a fe tah a, a hril a; chun, Ahab chu Elija hmu tum chun a fe tah a."
"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?","Chun, Ahab chun Elija chu a va hmu chun a kuomah, “Nang i ni maw, Israelhai suklungzîngtupa?” a ta."
"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim.","Ama chun a dawn a, “Israelhai hi ka suklungzîng nawh ie, nang le i pa sûnghaiin annâwm an suk- lungzîng lem chu.

"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel’s table.","Chuleiin, tuhin Israelhai po po le Baal zâwlnei za li le sâwmnga leh, Asera zâwlnei, Jezebel dawkâna thlaithlêng awt ve hlakhai za li kha ka kuomah Karmel tlângah vân ko khâwmtir rawh,” a ta."
"So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.","Chuongchun, Ahab chun Israel thlahai po po lai chun mi a tir a, zâwlneihai chu Karmel tlânga chun a ko khâwm a."
"And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.","Chun, Elija chun mipuihai po po chu a va hnai a, “Lung âwpinkaiin ieng chen am in um ding a na?

"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.","Chuongchun, bâwngchal pahni mi hung pe hai sienla, anni chun bâwngchal pakhat chu an puol dingin thlang hai sienla, chan nawi hai sienla, thing chungah sie hai sienla, a hnuoia mei sêm loin; chun, keiin bâwngchal pakhat chu buotsai vêng ka ta, thing chunga chun sieng ka ta, mei sêm bîk naw ning ah."
"And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.","Chun, nangni chun in pathien hming chu lam unla, kei khawma LALPA hming lam ka ta, chuong- chun, meia hung dawntu Pathien taphawt chu Pathien ni raw se,” a ta.

"And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.","Chuongchun, Elija chun Baal zâwlneihai kuoma chun, “Nangnîn bâwngchal pakhat hi in puola dingin thlang unla, buotsai hmasa ro, nangni chu in tam deu hi; in pa- thien hming chu ko unla, amiruok- chu, a hnuoiah mei chu sêm naw ro,” a ta."
"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.","Chun, bâwngchal an puol chu an lâk a, an buotsai tah a, “Aw Baal, mi hung dawn raw khai,” tiin zîngkâra inthawka sûn chenin Baal hming chu an ko a.

"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.","Chun, sûnlai tak chun Elija chun anni chu tielin, “Khêk inring ta unla, pathien a ni sih a, ân ngaituo hri amanih, annawleh a in hlau a, sukṭhang ding amani khawm nîng a tih,” a ta."

"And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.","Chun, nisa a hung inher chun zân tieng inthâwi hun chen ding hin an hril ruol duol duol zing a, nisienlakhawm, râwl riva hrim hrim a um nawh a, dawntu ding hrim hrim amanih, a lo ngaisaktu hrim hrim amani khawm an um bawk nawh a."
"And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.","Chuongchun, Elija chun mipui- hai po po kuoma chun, “Mi hung hnai ta u khai,” a ta; chun, mipuihai po po chun an va hnai a.

"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.","Chun, “I hming chu Israel nîng a tih,” ti lo dawngtu Jakob nauhai hnam zât lung sâwm le pahni Elija chun a lâk a."
"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.",Chuong lunghai chun LALPA hmingin maichâm a siem a; maichâm vêl chu bu chi tekhâwng hni inleng ding zet hin a cho khur a.
"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.","Chun, thing chu a hang sep fel a, bâwngchal chu a chan nâwi a, thing chunga chun a sieh a.

And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.,"Chun, tui chu maichâm vêla chun a luong ta dum dum a; chun, cho khur chu tuiin a suksip bawk a."
"And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.","Chun, zântienga inthâwi hun lai chun zâwlnei Elija chun a va pan hnai a, “Aw LALPA, Abraham hai, Isaak hai, Israel hai Pathien, nang hi Israel rama Pathien i ni le, kei hi i siehlaw ka na, hieng po po hi nangma thua thaw ka ni ti vawisûn hin hre tâwl raw hai se."
"Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.","Mi lo ngaipêk la, hieng mipuihai hin nang LALPA hi Pathien i na, an lungrilhai în lettir nâwk tah a ni ti an hriet theina dingin aw LALPA, mi lo ngaipêk rawh,” a ta."
"Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.","Chuongchun, LALPA mei chu a hung tlah a, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân dâm, thing dâm, pilvut dâm, lung dâm chu a kâng hmang a, cho khur a tui khawm chu a hîp kang ta vawng a."

"And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.

"And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.","Chuongchun, Elija chun Ahab kuoma chun, “Hang fe la, fain hang dâwn ta rawh, ruopui sûr ding ri a um a nih ie,” a ta."
"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.","Chuongchun, Ahab chu fa le dâwn dingin a hang fe tah a.

"And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing.

"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.","Chun, a vawi sarinaa chun, “Ngai ta, tuisuorieta inthawkin mi- hriem kut ruol chau hi sûm a lâwn kai nel nel el,” a ta.

"And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:","Chun, sâwt nawtêa chun vân chu thli le sûmin a hung dum ta khup el a, ruopui vânâwn a hung sûr tah a.

"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.","Ahab chun Elija thilthaw po po, kâwl hnâma zâwlneihai po po a that thuhai leh Jezebel chu a hril a."
"Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.","Chuongchun, Jezebel chun Elija kuomah, “khâng mihai laia mi pa- khat hringna anga zîngah hieng tik phât hin i hringna ka siempêk ve naw che chun pathienhai chun an law law mi law el hai sienla, chu nêka nasa lem khawm a,” tiin mi a tir a."
"And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.","Chuongchun, a ṭih a, a tho a, a tlânse tah a, Judai rama Beer-seba khuo a va tlung a, chutaka chun a siehlaw chu a mâksan a."
"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.","Ama ruok chu thlalêrah ni khat lama hlaah a feh a, Juniper thing hnuoia hin a ṭhung a, thi a hni tah a, “A hun tah ie, aw LALPA, tuhin ka hringna hi la el ta, ka puhai nêkin ka ṭha chuong bîk si nawh a,” a ta."

"And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water.

"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.","Chun, a tho a, a fâkin a dâwn a, chuongchun, chu bu lei chun Pathien tlâng Horeb chenin ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli a feh a."
"And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?","Chun, chutaka pûk pakhat a va tlung a, chutaka chun a um tah a; chun, ngai ta, LALPA thu a kuomah a hung tlung a, a kuomah, “Hitaka hin ieng am i thawh a, Elija?” a ta."
"And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.","Ama chun, “LALPA sipaihai Pathien ta ding hin ṭhahnem ka ngai êm êm hlak a, Israel thlahai hlak chun i thuthlung an nghatsan a, i maichâmhai an sukchim a, i zâwl- neihai kâwlhnâmin an sâthlum sih a; a la um chu kei bak hi ka na, ka hring- na mi lâkpêk an tum a nih,” a ta."
"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah.

"And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah.","Chun, ama chun, “Ram hi ka ta a ni tah ti le, Israelhai po po khawm hin keima hi lal dingin an mi thlîr zing a nih ti i hriet a, amiruokchu, ram chu ka unaupa ta dingin a hung inlet ta lem a; LALPA lo ruot dânah a ta a ni hrim a nih."
"And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.","Tuhin thil pakhat hni ding che ka nei a, mi remti nawpêk naw hrâm rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuom- ah, “Hril ta la,” a ta."
"And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka hni che a nih, lal Solomon kuoma chun hril la, (i thu chu a sêl âwm si nawh a) Sunam mi Abisag hi nuhmeiah mîn neitir raw se,” a ta."
"And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.","Chun, Bathseba chun, “Aw le, lal chu lo bepêk ka ti che,” a ta."
"Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.","Chuongchun, Bathseba chu Adonija va bepêk dingin lal Solomon kuoma chun a fe tah a.

"Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.","Chuongchun, “Thil pakhat chi- terek ka hni ding che a nih, mi remti nawpêk naw hrâm rawh,” a ta. Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Hni ta la, nu, remti nawpêk naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta."
"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.","Chun, ama chun, “Sunam mi Abisag hi i unaupa Adonija nuhmeiah inneitir rawh,” a ta."
"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.","Chun, lal Solomon chun a dawn a, a nu kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea Sunam mi Abisag hi Adonija ta dinga hni am i ni leh?

"Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun, “LALPA hming sâlin, Adonija thil hni hin ama chunga thina thuhril a ni naw tâkleh, Pathienin a law law mi law el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawm a."
"Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.","Chuongchun, LALPA a thutiem anga mi sukdet a, ka pa lal David lalṭhungphaa mîn ṭhungtir a, sung- kuo mi lo inngîrpêktu hringna sâlin ka hril hi, Adonija hi vawisûn le le hin sukhlum nghâl ding a nih,” a tih a; ṭawng ân khâm tah a."
"And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu a tir a, ama chu a va thawh a, a thi tah a."
"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.","Chun, thiempu Abiathar kuoma chun lal chun, “Anathoth khuoa nanga in le loah fe dai rawh, thi tlâk chu i ni ngei a, amiruokchu, ka pa David hmaa LALPA Pathien bâwm i lo zâwn hlak lei le, ka pa rinum tuornahai po poa chun i lo tuor ve ta hlak leiin tuhin chu chu la sukhlum hri naw ning che,” a ta."
"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Abiathar chu LALPA thiempu a nina chu a bân tah a; LALPAIN Silo khuoa Eli sûnghai chungchâng thu a hril kha ân tlungtir theina dingin."
"And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.","Chun, chu thu chu Joab chun a lo hriet a, Joab chu Absalom tieng khan a ṭhang naw a chu, Adonija tienga ṭhang a ni sih a.

"And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.","Chun, “LALPA puon inah Joab a tlân a, ngai ta, maichâm bulah a um,” tiin lal Solomon chu an hril a. Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu, “Hang thaw rawh,” tiin a tir a."
"And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.","Benaia chu, LALPA puon ina chun a hang feh a, a kuoma chun, “Lalin, ‘Hung thla raw se’, a tih” a ta.

"And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “A hril ang chun hang thaw la, phûm rawh, a san um dêr loa Joabin thisen ân suoa inthawka kha kei le ka pa sûnghai chu i sukfihlîm theina ding- in."
"And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.","Chuongchun, ama nêka mi ṭha lem le mi fel lem pahni Nera naupa Abner, Israelhai sipai hotu le, Jether naupa Amasa, Judahai sipai hotu kha ka pa David hriet loa a thawh a, kâwlhnâma a that leiin LALPAIN a thisen chu ama lu chung ngeiah hung inlêttir a tih."
"So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.","Chuongchun, an thisen chu Joab lu chung le a thlahai lu chungah kumkhuoin lêt a ta, David chunga dâm, a thlahai chunga dâm, a sûng- hai chunga dâm, a lalṭhungpha chunga dâm ruok chun LALPA kuoma inthawka lungmuongna kum- khuoin um zing lem a tih,” a ta."
"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.","Chuongchun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu a hang feh a, a hang thawh a, a that tah a; chun, thlalêra ama ina chun an phûm tah a."
And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.,"Chun, lalin Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu sipaihai chungah a ai ân awtir a, chun, thiempu Zadok chu lalin Abiathar ai ân awtir a."
"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.","Chun, lalin Simei chu ân kotir a, a kuomah, “Jerusalema hin in bâwl la, chutaka chun um la, chutaka inthawk chun khâwlai dang khawm suok naw rawh."
"For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.","I suok ni, Kidron vadung i kân ni le le chun i thi ngei ding a nih ti hre raw khai, chun, i thisen chu nangma lu chunga ngei um a tih,” a ta."
"And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.","Simei chun lal kuomah, “An dik ie, lal ka puin a hril ang chun i siehlaw hin thaw pei a tih,” a ta. Chun, Simei chu Jerusalema chun sâwtrei chu a um a."
"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.","Chun, kum thum ân vawi hnung chun Simei siehlawhai pahni chu Gath khaw lal Maaka naupa Akis kuomah an zâm a.

"And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.","Simei chu a tho a, a sabengtung chu a buotsai a, siehlawhai zawng dingin Gath khuoa Akis kuoma chun a fe tah a; chun, Simei chun Gath khuoa inthawk chun a siehlawhai chu a va ṭhuoi tah a."
"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.","Chun, Simei chu Gath khuoah a va feh a, Jerusalemah a hung nâwk tah, ti Solomon chu an hril a."
"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good.","Chun, lal chun Simei chu ân kotir a, a kuomah, “ ‘I suok ni, ram danga i suok ni le lein i thi ngei ding a nih,’ ti khan LALPA hming sâlin ṭawng kân khâmtir chein, kân hriet- tir che a ni naw am a nih? chun, nang khawma ka kuomah, ‘I thu hril ka hriet hi a ṭha ie,’ i ti kha."
"Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?",Iengdinga LALPA ṭawng in- khâm le thu ka pêk che kha hlen lo am i nih a?” a ta.
"The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.","Chun, lal ma chun Simei kuom- ah, “I lungril sûng rîtlozie, ka pa David chunga i thawziehai kha i hriet vawng a, chuongchun, LALPAIN i rîtlona hi nangma lu chunga ngei hung inlêttir a tih."
"But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.","Lal Solomon ruok chu mal- sâwmin um a ta, David lalṭhungpha chu LALPA hmaah kumkhuoa sukdet ning a tih,” a ta."
"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.","Chuongchun, lal chun Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu thu a pêk a, ama chu a va thawh a, a that tah a. Chuongchun, ram chu Solomon kuta suknghetin a um tah a."
"And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.","Suria lal Benhadad chun sipaihai po po chu ân khâwm vawng a, lal sâwmthum le pahni an ṭhang a, sakawr le tawlailîrhai leh a hang feh a, Samari khuo chu a hang inhuol a, a hang thawh a."
"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,","Israel lal Ahab kuoma chun khawpui sûngah mi a tir a, a kuomah, “Benhadad chun hieng ang hin a tih,"

"And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have.","Chun, Israel lal chun a lo dawn a, “Aw laltak ka pu, i hril ang chu a ni annâwm, keima le ka nei po po chu i ta a nih,” a ta."
"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;","Chun, a mi tirhai chu an fe nâwk a, “Benhadad chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘I kuomah, i tangkahai, i rângka- chakhai, i nuhmeihai le i nauhai leh i mi pêk ding a nih, tiin mi ka hung tir luoh a;"
"but I will send my servants unto thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.","amiruokchu, zîngah hi pha vêla hin ka mihai i kuomah hung tir ka ta, i in le i mihai inhai chu an hung dap ding a nih; chun, i thil ngainat zâwng- hai chu lâng an ta, hung pui vawng an tih,’ tiin,” an ta."
"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chun a rama upahai po po chu a ko a, “Lo hre ta u khai, hi mipa hin thil ṭha nawtak thaw a tumzie hi; ka kuomah mi a hung tir a, ka nuhmeihai, ka nauhai, ka tangka dâm, ka rângkachak dâm a hung ngên a, ka lo sêl hlak khawm ni si loin,” a ta."

"Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.","Chuongchun, Benhadad mitirhai kuoma chun, “Laltak ka pu kuoma chun, ‘I siehlaw kuoma mi tira i hung ngên hmasak ang po po khan chu thâwng ka ta, amiruokchu, hi hi chu chu thaw thei naw ning, a tih,’ ti ro,” a ta.

"And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.","Chun, Benhadad chun a kuom- ah mi a tir nâwk a, “Ka hnungzuitu- hai po po hin Samari khaw pilvut veikhat chau khawm an changkim thei ding chun pathienhaiin an law law mi law hai sienla, chu nêka nasa khawm a,” a ta."

"And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.","Chun, ama le a lalhaiin bûktêah zu an lo dâwn laiin, chu thu chu Benhadad chun a lo hriet a, a mihai kuoma chun, “Insiem ro khai,” a ta.

"And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, ngai ta, zâwlnei pakhat hin Israel lal Ahab chu a va hnai a, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hieng mipui tamtak hi i hmu am? ngai ta, vawisûn hin i kutah ka pêk ding a nih; chuongchun, kei hi LALPA chu ka nih ti hrieng i tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.","Chun, Ahab chun, “Tu hmangin am ie?” a ta. Ama chun, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ram bunghaia tlangvâl hotuhai hmang hin,’ tiin,” a ta.

"Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.","Chuongchun, ama chun ram bunghaia hotu tlangvâlhai chu a ko khâwm a, za hni le sâwmthum le pahni an na; chuhai zoa chun mi po po, Israel thlahai po po chu a ko khâwm a, sâng sari an nih."
"And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.","Chun, sûnchang laitakin an va suok tah a. Benhadad le lalhai, ama ṭhangpuitu lal sâwmthum le pahni- hai ruok chu an bûktêa chun an lo indâwn rui a."
"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.","Chun, ram bunghaia hotu tlangvâlhai chu an va suok hmasah a, chun, Benhadad chun mi a tir a, anni chun, “Samari khuoa inthawka hung suok an um,” tiin an hril a."

"So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.","Chuongchun, chuonghai, ram bunga hotuhai tlangvâlhai chu a hung zuitu sipaihai le chun khuoa inthawk chu an suok a."
"And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.","Chun, an va bitum senghai chu an va that a, chuongchun, Suria mi- hai chu an tlânse tah a, Israelhai chun an hnawt a, chun, Suria lal Benhadad chu sakawr chunga chuongin sakawr chung chuong mi- hai leh an tlânsuok tah a."
"And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.","Chun, Israel lal chu a va suok a, sakawr le tawlailîrhai chu a va thawh a, Suria mihai chu a va that rak el a."
"And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.","Chun, zâwlnei chun Israel lal chu a va hnai a, a kuomah, “In- sukhrât sau sau la, i thaw dân ding ngaituo raw khai, kum a hung invawi hin Suria lal chun a hung thaw nâwk ding che a nih,” a ta."
"And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.","Chun, Suria lalhai chun a kuomah, “An pathien hi tlâng pathien a na, chuleiin, eini nêkin an hrât a ni hi, phaizâwlah thaw ta inla, anni nêk chun hrât lem ngei ei tih."
"And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;","Chun, hieng ang hin thaw rawh, lalhai hi an rêngin thleng vawng la, an aia hin ram awptuhai sie lem la,"
"and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.","chun, sipaihai tawlailîr dâm, sakawr dâm, i chân ta zât ang chie kha sipaihai siemṭha nâwk la; chuongchun, phaizâwla thâwng kan ta, anni nêk chun hrât lem ngei kan tih,” an ta.

"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.","Chun, a kum nâwka chun Benhadad chun Suria mihai chu a kei khâwm a, Israelhai chu thaw dingin Aphek khuoa chun a hang feh a."
"And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu an pungkhâwm a, fâk dinghai an thak zet zet a, thaw dingin an inthawk tah a; chun, Israel thlahai chun kêlte tlâwmte ruol hni ang chau tê hin an va ep veh a; Suria mihai ruok chu a ram sip hin an sip mup el a."
"And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, Pathien mi chun Israel lal chu a va hnai a, a va biek a, a kuomah, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Suria mihaiin LALPA chu tlâng- hai pathien a na, ruom pathien chu a ni nawh an ti a nih; chuleiin, hieng mipui tamtakhai hi i kutah ka pêk ding a nih; chuongchun, kei hi LALPA chu ka nih ti hrieng in tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.","Chun, ni sari sûng zet chu an inep zing a.

"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.","Mi danghai ruok chu Aphekah khawpui sûnga chun an tlânlût a, a la umhai chu mi sîng hni le sâng sari kul chimin a delhlum a.

"And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.","Chun, a rawihai chun a kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, Israel sûng kuohai laia lalhai hi mi lunginsietthei tak an nih ti thu kan hriet a, saiip puon bilin, ei lua hin hruia inkhitin Israel lal kuomah mi vân fetir raw khai; ama chun a hla nuom khiet che rawi mawh,” an ta."
"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live.

"Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him.

"And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.

So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.","Chun, Benhadad chun a kuom- ah, “Ka pain i pa kuoma inthawka khuo a lo lâkhai kha pe kîr nâwk ka ta; chun, ka pain Samari khuoa dâwrpui hmun a siem ang khan Damaska khuoah i dâwrpui hmun ding i siem ve ding annâwm,” a ta.

"Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.","Ama chun a vuok nuom nawh a, Chuongchun, a kuomah, “LALPA thu chu i awi naw leiin, ngai ta, nang hin i mi liemsan phingleh, sakeibakneiin lo sêng a ti che,” a ta.

"Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.","Chuongchun, mi dang a va hmu nâwk a, “Mi hang vaw ta khai,” a ta. Ama chun a hang vuok a, a vuok sil tah a."
"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.","Chuongchun, zâwlnei chu a feh a, lampuia hin lal chu a lo inchân a, a chal khitnaa a mit inkhumin ân siem danglam a."
"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.","Chun, lal a hung tlung chun lal chu a lo ko a, “I siehlaw hin indona rûnpui hmunah ka va feh a; chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat hi a hung nghah a, ka kuomah mi pakhat a hung ṭhuoi a, ‘Ama hi lo vêng tlat rawh, a tlân- hmang hlau chun a hringna aiah i hringna chân i tih, annawleh tangka talent khat i pêk ding a nih,’ a ta."
"And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.","Chun, i siehlaw hi ka buoi êm kâr chun a lo fe hmang dai el tah a,” a ta. Chun, Israel lal chun a kuomah, “Chuong ang tak chu a nih, i chunga thu tlu chu, nangma ngeiin i suk- thlûk diem ta chu teh,” a ta."
"And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.","Chun, ama chun a mita inthawk chun a chal khitna chu a hlîp ta vak a; chun, Israel lal chun zâwlneihai laia mi a nih ti a hriet tah a."
"And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ṭawngsie ka înphur ta chu în suo ta leiin a hringna aiah i hringna; a mihai aiah i mihai chân i tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.","Chun, Israel lal chu ngûitak le lungâwi nawtakin a fe tah a; Samari khuoa chun a fe tah a."
"And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.","Chun, Jezreel mi Naboth chun grêp huon a nei a, chu chu Jezreela Samari lal Ahab in bul ela um a nih."
"And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.","Chun, Ahab chun Naboth chu, “Ka in bul a ni lei hin i grêp huon hi thlai huon dingin mi pe raw khai, a aia chun grêp huon ṭha lem pêng ka ti che; annawleh i nuom lem chun a tangkain a man tâwk chu pêng ka ti che,” a ta, a biek a."
"And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.","Chun, Naboth chun Ahab kuom- ah, “Ka puhai ro hang pêk che chu ka ta dingin a âwmin a âwm nawh ie,” a tih a."
"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.","Chun, Jezreel mi Naboth chun a kuoma chuong ang thu chu a hril lei chun Ahab chu ngûitak le lungâwi nawtakin a inah a lût tah a, “Ka puhai ro pe thei naw ning che,” a ti tlat sih a. Chuongchun, a khuma chun a zâl a, khingtieng a nghah a, bu hrim hrim khawm a fâk nuom ta nawh a."
"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?","Chuongchun, a nuhmei Jezebel chu a va feh a, a kuomah, “Iengtiziea i lungril chuong lâwma a lungngai a, bu hrim hrim i fâk naw am a ni leh?” a ta."
"And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Jezreel mi Naboth chu ka va biek a, a kuomah, ‘I grêp huon hi min châwktir rawh, annawleh i dit lem chun a aiah grêp huon dang pêng ka ti che,’ ka tih a, ama chun, ‘Ka grêp huon chu pe thei naw ning che,’ tiin a mi dawn annâwm ie,” a ta."
"And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.","Chun, a nuhmei Jezebel chun a kuomah, “Israel ram lal hi i nih a ni naw am a nih? Tho la, bu fa la, lungril hlimtakin um raw khai, Jezreel mi Naboth grêp huon chu keiin pêng ka ti che,” a ta."
"So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth.","Chuongchun, Ahab hming chun lekha a ziek a, a namna chun a nam a; chun, lekha chu a umna khuoa Naboth tuolbâwm upahai le mi ṭhahai kuomah ân phur a."
"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:","Chun, lekhaa chun, “Bu nghei thu lo phuong unla, mipui lai Naboth chu inhmatâwngtir unla,"
"and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.","mi pahni Belial nauhai a hmaa chun inṭhungtir unla, ‘Pathien le lal i hrilsiet a nih,’ tia a hêktu dingin lo siem ro. Chun, ama chu ṭhuoi suok unla, lo dêng hlum ro,” a ta."
"And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.","Chun, a umna khuoa mi, a umna khuoa um upahai le mi ṭhahai chun Jezebelin ân phur lekhaa a ziek ang chun an thawh a."
"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.","Bu nghei thu chu an phuong a, mipuihai lai Naboth chu an inhma- tâwngtir a."
"And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.","Chun, mi pahni Belial nauhai chu a hmaa chun an va ṭhung a; chun, Belial mihai chun mipuihai hmaa chun, “Naboth hin Pathien le lal a hrilsiet a nih,” tiin ama Naboth chu an hêk a. Chuongchun, khuoa in- thawk chun an ṭhuoi suok a, lungin an dêng a, a thi tah a."
"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.","Chuongchun, Jezebel kuoma chun, “Naboth chu lungin an dêng a, a thi tah,” tiin mi an tir a."
"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.","Chun, Jezebelin Naboth chu lungin an dêng a, a thi tah ti a hrietin Jezebel chun Ahab kuoma chun, “Tho la, Jezreel mi Naboth grêp huon, ân châwktir phal naw che kha nei ta raw le, Naboth chu a dam ta nawh a, a thi tah a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.","Chun, Ahab chun Naboth a thi tah ti a hrietin Jezreel mi Naboth grêp huon chu nei dinga fe thla dingin Ahab chu a tho tah a."
"And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Tisbe mi Elija kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a."
"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.","“Tho la, Samari khuoa um, Israel lal Ahab be dingin zu fe raw khai, ngai ta, Naboth grêp huona chun a um a; nei tumin chutaka chun a fe thla a nih."
"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.","A kuoma chun, ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, I that a, i neipêk nâwk nghâl a ni maw? tiin,’ ti la, a kuomah, ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Uiin Naboth thisen an liekna hmun ngeia hin nanga thisen khawm hi an liek ve ding a nih, tiin,’ ti rawh,” a tih a."
"And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah.","Chun, Ahab chun Elija kuomah, “I mi hung hmu ta maw, ka hmêl- mapa?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Ka hmu ta che a ni hi, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw thaw dingin inzawr ta che chu."
"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:","Ngai ta, i chunga hin thil ṭha- naw hung intlungtir ka ta, hung suk- bohmang ka ti cheh a, Ahaba inthawk hin naupasal taphawt chu Israel rama mi khuokhira um amanih, khuokhir naw amani khawm chu sukbohmang ka ta,"
"and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin.","nangin i mi suklungsen lei le, Israelhai chu thil în suksuoltir leiin Nebat naupa Jeroboam sûnghai le Ahija naupa Baasa sûnghai ang elin i sûnghai hi siem ka tih,” a ta."
"And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.","Chun, Jezebel chungchâng thu khawm LALPAIN a hril a, “Jezreel khaw kul bulah Jezebel hi uiin la fâng an tih."
Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.,"Ahab sûngkuohai laia mi khawpuia thihai po chu uiin fâng an ta; rama thihai po chu chunglêng vatehaiin fâng an tih,” tiin."
"(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.","(A nuhmei Jezebel infuipawr a, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw thaw dinga inzawr Ahab ang hrim hrim hi tukhawm an um nawh."
"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)","LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawtsuok Amor mihai thilthaw tin- rêng ang, milimhai bein thil tirdak- umtakin a thaw hlak a)."
"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.","Chun, Ahab chun chuong thu chu a hriet chun a puon a keithlêr a, saiip puon a sil a, bu a nghei a, saiip puon chungah a zâl a, ngûitakin ân lawn vêl a."
"And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Tisbe mi Elija kuoma chun a hung tlung a,"
"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s day will I bring the evil upon his house.","“Ahab ka hmaa an ngaitlâwm- zie hi i hmu am?

And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.,"Chun, kum thum sûng chu Suriahai le Israelhai chu indo loin an um a."
"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.","Chun, a kum thum kum chun Juda lal Jehosaphat chu Israel lal kuomah a zu feh a."
"And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?","Israel lal chun a siehlawhai kuomah, “Ramoth-gilead khuo hi eini ta a nih ti hre zing sih a, iengtizieha Suria lal hi lâkpêk loa um am ei ni aw?” a ta. Chun, Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Ramoth-gilead khuo hi mi hang thawpui ve nuom i tim chu?” a ta."
"And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.","Chun, Jehosaphat chun Israel lal kuoma chun, “Kei le nang, i mihai le ka mihai chu pumkhat ei na, ka sakawrhai le i sakawrhai chu pum- khat an nih annâwm,” a ta."
"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.","Chun, Jehosaphat chun Israel lal kuoma chun, “LALPA thu chu la ngai hri phawt la tie,” a ta."
"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chun zâwlneihai mi za li lai a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Ramoth-gilead khuo hi thaw dingin ka hang inthawk ding am inthawk lo ding?” a ta. Anni chun, “Hang inthawk rawh, LALPAIN lal kuta hin a pêk ding a nih,” an ta."
"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?","Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun, “Hitaka hin LALPA zâwlnei dang tu amani bêk ka hang râwn ding hi an um naw am a ni aw?” a ta."
"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.","Chun, Israel lal chun Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “LALPA mi râwnpêk ding Imla naupa Mikaia kha chu a la um kha maw, nisienlakhawm, ama hi chu ka theida zâwngtak a nih; ka chungchâng thu hi a se tieng ngawt naw chu a ṭha tieng a hril hrim hrim ngai nawh,” a ta. Chun, Jehosaphat chun, “Lal hin chuong ang chun chu ti naw raw se khai,” a ta."
"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chun hotu pakhat a hang ko a, “Imla naupa Mikaia kha hung ṭhuoi vak ta,” a ta."
"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","Chun, Israel lal le Juda lal Jehosaphat chu Samari khaw kul kawtkhâr lûtna bula hrizâwla chun an lal puona inthuomin an lalṭhung- pha ve vea chun an ṭhung a; chun, zâwlneihai po po chun an hmaa chun thu an hril a."
"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.","Chun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chun thîr kihai a siempêk a, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hienghai hin Suria mihai chu chimit dêr khawpin sik i tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuong ang bawkin zâwlnei po pohai chun, “Ramoth-gileada chun hang fe la, hang hlawtling raw khai, LALPA chun lal kuta hin a pêk ding a nih,” tiin an hril a."
"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.","Chun, Mikaia va ko dinga an tir chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta khai, zâwl- neihai hin thu inang vawngin a ṭha tiengin lal kuoma hin thu an hril seng a, an hril ta ang seng chun hang hril ve la, a ṭha tiengin hang hril ve rawh aw,” tiin a hril a."
"And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.","Mikaia ruok chun, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, LALPAIN ka kuoma a hril chu a nih ka hang hril ding chu,” a ta."
"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chun, lal kuoma a hang tlung chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Mikaia, Ramoth-gilead khuo thaw dingin ka hang inthawk ding am a ni, hang inthawk lo ding?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Hang inthawk la, hang hlawtling raw khai, LALPA chun lal kutah a pêk ding a nih,” a ta."
"And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Thu- tak ngawt naw chu LALPA hminga ka kuoma hril lo dingin vawi iengzât rau am ṭawng kân khâmtir ding che a ni leh?” a ta."
"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.","Chun, ama chun, “Israelhai po po vêngtu neilo berâm angin tlânga an indar vawng ka hmuh a, LALPA- IN, ‘Hienghai hin hotu an nei ta nawh a, mi tin mâni in tieng seng lung- muongtakin fe diel el ta raw hai se,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?","Chun, Israel lal chun Jeho- saphat kuomah, “Ka chungchâng thu hi a se tieng ngawt naw chu a ṭha tieng hrim hrim chu hril naw ni ti ka hril che a ni naw am a ni kha?” a ta."
"And Micaiah said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Chuleiin, LALPA thu hi lo ngai ta u, LALPA chu a lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ka hmuh a, vâna mipuihai po po, a changtieng le vawitienga ngîrhai leh."
"And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.","Chun, LALPAIN, ‘Ahab hi Ramoth-gilead khuoa hang feh a, râla thi dingin tuin am thlêm an ta?’ a ti a nih, pakhatin hieng hin a ta, mi dangin chuong chun a ta."
"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.","Chuongchun, thlarau pakhat hi a hung suok a, LALPA hmaa chun a ngîr a, ‘Keiin thlêm ka tih,’ a ta."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.","Chun, LALPAIN a kuomah, ‘Iengtin am ie?’ a ta. Chun, ama chun, ‘Va fêng ka ta, zâwlnei po pohai hmûra chun thlarau khêlinhlipah vân chang ka tih,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun, ‘Thlêm ngei i ta, hlaw khawm hlawtling ngei i tih, va fe la, chuong ang chun va thaw raw leh,’ a ta."
"Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.","Chuongchun, ngai ta, LALPAIN hieng i zâwlneihai po po hmûra hin thlarau khêlinhlip a sieh a, i chungchâng thu hi a ṭha naw tiengin LALPAIN a hril tah a nih,” a ta."
"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?","Chuongchun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chun a hung hnai a, Mikaia bienga chun a hung ben a, “LALPA thlarau chun i kuoma thu hril dingin khawtieng am a mi mâksan leh?” a ta."
"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.","Mikaia chun, “Ngai rawh, pin- dan sûngrila inbi dinga i lût ni chun la hrieng i tih,” a ta."
"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;","Chun, Israel lal chun, “Mikaia hi ṭhuoi unla, khawpui awptu Amon le lal naupa Joas kuomah fepui ta u;"
"and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.","chun, lalin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hi mipa hi lung inah khum unla, lungmuongtaka ka hung nâwk hma- khat chun rinumna tui lo pe ro,’ tiin, ti ro,” a ta."
"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Lung- muongtaka i hung nâwk tâk leh, LALPAIN kei mi hmang hin thu a hril naw nîng a tih,” a ta. Chun, ama ma chun, “Nangni mipuihai, in rêngin lo hre seng ro,” a ta."
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.,"Chuongchun, Israel lal le Juda lal Jehosaphat chu Ramoth-gileada chun an hang feh a."
"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.","Chun, Israel lal chun Jehosa- phat kuomah, “Insiem danglam ka ta, indonaa chun hang fe vêng ka tih a, nang ruok chun chu i lal puon sil la,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israel lal chu ân siem danglam a, indonaa chun a hang feh a."
"Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.","Chun, Suria lal chun a tawlailîr chunga hotu sâwmthum le pahnihai kuoma chun, “Israel lal ngawt naw chu, mi lien khawm, mi chîn khawm a tu tukhawm thaw naw ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.","Chun, tawlailîr chunga hotuhai chun Jehosaphat an hei hmu chun, “Israel lal a ni ngei el leh,” an ta; chuongchun, thaw tum chun an inhuol tah a; chun, Jehosaphat chu a khêk suok a."
"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.","Chun, tawlailîr chunga hotuhai chun Israel lal a ni nawh ti an hriet chun, an hnawt lai chu an lêt nâwk tah a."
"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.","Chun, mi pakhat hin tum bîk neilo hin a thalngul a kuoi a, Israel lal chu âwmphaw le âwmphaw inkârah a kâp a, chuongchun, a tawlailîr khaltu kuoma chun, “Kei her la, sipaihai laia inthawk hi mi suokpui raw khai, hliemna natak ka tuok ta hi,” a ta."
"And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.","Chun, chu ni chun inthawna chu a nasa ta hle el a, lal chu a tawlailîra chun Suria mihai hmua chun an inngîrtir a, chun, zântieng chun a thi tah a; ama inhliemnaa inthawk chun thisen chu tawlailîr sûnga chun a luong dup dup a."
"And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.","Chun, nisa tlâk tâwm lai vêl chun, sipaihai lai chun, “Mi tin mâni in tieng seng, mi tin mâni ram tieng seng fe vawng ta raw hai se,” tiin an khêk vêl ta rak el a."
"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.","Chuongchun, lal chu a thi tah a, Samari khuoa chun an lûtpui a; Samari khuoa chun lal chu an phûm tah a."
And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves there); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.,"Chun, Samari khaw dil panga chun tawlailîr chu an sâwp a; chun, LALPA thu hril ta ang ngei khan a thisen chu uiin an liek tah a; (chutaka chun nawchizawrhai chu an insâwp hlak)."
"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Chuongchun, Ahab chanchin danghai, a thilthaw po pohai, a saiha in bâwl dâm, a khaw siemhai po po chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.,"Chuongchun, Ahab chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a; chun, a nau- pa Ahazia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.,"Chun, Israel lal Ahab inlal kum linaah Asa naupa Jehosaphat chu Judahai chunga chun ân lal ṭan a."
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.,"Jehosaphat chu ân lal ṭan lai chun kum sâwmthum le kum nga a na; Jerusalem khuoa chun kum sâwmhni le kum nga ro a rêl a. A nu hming chu Azuba, Silhi naunu a nih."
"And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.","A pa Asa lampui hraw po po chu a hraw veh a; pêtsan dêr loin LALPA mithmuah thilṭha a thaw hlak a, bâwlhmunhai chu a sukbo vawng nawh a, bâwlhmunahai chun mihai chu an inthâwiin riminhnikhai chu an la raw zing hlak a."
And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.,"Chun, Jehosaphat chun Israel lal le inremna a siem a."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Jehosaphat chan- chin danghai dâm, a thilthawtheizie a suklang thuhai dâm, a râl do thu- hai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.","Chun, a pa Asa dam laia pasal inzawrhai a la umhai kha a rama inthawkin a hnawt suok vawng a."
And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.,"Chun, Edom rama chun lal an um nawh a, lal aiawtu chun ro a rêl a."
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.,"Jehosaphat chun Ophira râng- kachak phur ding Tarsis lawnghai a tuk a, nisienlakhawm, an fe ta nawh a; Ezion-geber hmuna chun lawnghai chu a se ta vawng sih a."
"Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.","Chuongchun, Ahab naupa Aha- zia chun Jehosaphat kuomah, “Ka mihai hi i mihai leh lawngah fe hmunkhat raw hai se chu,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun a remti nawh a."
"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Jehosaphat chu a puhai kuomah a in tah a, a puhai lai, a pu David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; chun, a naupa Jehoram chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.","Chun, Juda lal Jehosaphat inlal kum sâwm le kum sari kum chun Ahab naupa Ahazia chu Samari khuoa chun Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a; Israelhai chunga chun kum hni ân lal a."
"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.","Chun, LALPA mithmua chun thil ṭhanaw a thaw hlak a, a nu le a pa lampui hrawhai, Nebat naupa Israel- hai thil insuksuoltirtu Jeroboam lampui hrawhai chu a hraw ve hlak a."
"And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.","Chun, a pa thaw ang taphawt thawin Baal rawng a bâwl a, a biek hlak a, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu a suklungsen hlak."
"And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.","Chun, Solomon chun Aigupta lal Pharao le inkungkeina a siem a, Pharao naunu a nei a, ama in le LALPA in a bâwl hma le, Jerusalem khuo kula ân huol vêl hmakhat chun David khawpuia chun ân umtir a."
"Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.","Mipuihai chu bâwlhmunahai an inthâwi el hlak a, chu hma chun LALPA hming ta dinga in bâwl a la um hri naw leiin."
"And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.","Solomon chun LALPA chu a hmangai a, a pa David thuruothai chu a zâwm hlak a, bâwlhmunahai ân thâwi a, rim inhnikhai a raw el hlaka chu."
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.,"Chun, lal chu inthâwi dingin Gibeon khuoah a feh a, chu chu bâwl- hmun ropuitak a ni sih a; Solomon chun chu maichâm chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân sâng khat zet ân hlân a."
"In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.","Chun, Gibeon khuoa chun zânah LALPA chu Solomon kuomah a mangah a hung inlâr a; chun, Pa- thienin, “Hni ta, ieng am a na ka pêk ding che?” a ta."
"And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.","Solomon chun, “I siehlaw ka pa David kha i mithmua thutak le, felnaa leh, lungril indiktak puta a um ang pei khan nang chun a kuomah lunginsietna nasatak în langtir a, nangin hi lunginsietna nasatak hi a ta dingin i vopêk a, nangin a lal- ṭhungphaa ṭhung ding naupa i pêk a, vawisûna a hung um ta ang ngei hin."
"And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.","Chuongchun, aw LALPA ka Pathien, nang chun i siehlaw hi ka pa David aia chun lalah i lo siem tah a; kei chu chu naupangsie el ka la na, thu hung tieng le fe tieng khawm hi ka la hriet nawh a,"
"And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.","I siehlaw hi i mihai i thlanghai, mi tamtak, an tam leia tiem sêng ruollo le, a zât hriet sêng ruol lohai lai hin a um a na."
"Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?","Chuongchun, i mihai rorêlpêkna dingin i siehlaw hi hrietna lungril hung pe la, a sie le a ṭha ka thlier theina dingin, i mi hieng zât zozai hi tuin am ro rêlpêk thei a ta le?” a ta."
"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.","Chun, Solomonin chu thil chu a hni leiin, chu thuhril chun LALPA a suklâwm hleh a."
"And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;","Chun, Pathien chun a kuomah, “Nangin i ta dinga dam sâwtna hni lo a, hieng ang hi i hni lem leiin le, i ta dinga hausakna khawm hni lo a, i hmêlmahai thina ding khawm hni lo a, i ta dinga rorêl thiemna i hni leiin, ngai ta, i hni ang chun ka thaw tah a;"
"behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.","ngai ta, varna le hrietna lungril ka pêk che a nih; chuongchun, i hmaah nangma ang hrim hrim tu- khawm an um nawh a, i hnunga khawm nanga ang hrim hrim chu tukhawm hung um ta naw bawk an tih."
"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days.","Chun, i hni naw hausakna le ropuina khawm ka pêk bawk che; Chuongchun, i dam sûngin lalhai lai chun nanga ang hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
"And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.","I pa Davidin a hraw anga, ka thuruothai le ka thupêkhai pawm dinga ka lampuihai i hraw chun in- dam sâwttir bawk ka ti che,” a ta."
"And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.","Chun, Solomon chu a hang har a, ngai ta, mang a lo ni zing el a; chun, Jerusalemah a feh a, LALPA thu- thlung bâwm hmaah a ngîr a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thilinhlân ân hlân a; a siehlaw po pohai ta dingin ruoi a ṭheh a."
"Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.","Nuhmei pahni nawchizawr, lal kuoma chun an hung a, ama hmaah an hang ngîr a."
"And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.","Chun, nuhmei pakhat chun, “Aw ka lalpa, hi nuhmei le hin in khata um ve ve kan na, chu ina a um ve lai chun nau ka nei a."
"And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.","Chun, ka nau nei ni thum hnunga chun hi nuhmei khawm hin a nei veh a; um hmunkhat kan na, chu ina um keini pahni chau naw chu, chu ina chun tukhawm mikhuol um an um nawh a."
"And this woman’s child died in the night, because she lay upon it.","Chun, hi nuhmei nau hi zânah a lo thih a; a delhlum a nih."
"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.","Chuongchun, zân lai chun a tho a, i suoknu hi a in kârin ka naupa ka kuoma um chu a lâk a, a pawm a, a nau thi chu a mîn pawmtir a."
"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.","A zînga zîngkâra ka nau nêne pe dinga ka hang tho chun a thi a lo ni zing el a, nisienkhawm, zîngkâra ka hang en chieng chun, ngai ta, ka naupa, ka inei kha a lo ni ta dêr da el a,” a ta."
"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.","Nuhmei dang chun, “Ni lo, a dam lem hi ka naupa a na, a thi hi i naupa a nih,” a ti veh a. Pakhat chun, “Ni lo, a thi hi i naupa a na, a dam hi keia naupa a nih,” a lo ti tlat bawk a. Chuong ang chun lal hmaa chun an hril ve ve a."
"Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.","Chuongchun, lal chun, “Pakhat- in, ‘A dam lem hi ka naupa a na, a thi hi i naupa a nih,’ a tih a, chun, pa- khatin, ‘Ni lo, a thi hi i naupa a na, a dam hi ka naupa a nih,’ a ti bawk sih a,” a ta."
"And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.","Chun, lal chun, “Kâwlhnâm mi hung lapêk ta u,” a ta. Chuongchun, kâwlhnâm chu lal hmaa chun an hung lâk a."
"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.","Chun, lal chun, “Nautê a dam kha tum hni insuo unla, a chenve chu pakhat kha pe unla, a chenve chu pakhat kha pe ro,” a ta."
"Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.","Chuongchun, nautê dam lem a nu chun nautê chu a lainat êm êm el sih a; lal kuoma chun, “Aw ka lalpa, nautê dam hi ama kha pe el rawh, a that chu that lul naw raw khai,” a ta.

"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.","Chuongchun, lal chun a dawn a, “Nautê dam kha a hmasanu kha pe ro, that dêr naw ro, ama ngei kha a nu a ni kha,” a ta."
"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.","Chun, Israelhai po po chun chu thua lal rorêl dân chu an lo hriet a; lal chu an ṭi ta hle el a; rorêlna dinga Pathien varna amaa chun a um ti an hriet ta sih a."
And king Solomon was king over all Israel.,Lal Solomon chu Israelhai po po chungah lalin a um tah a.

"And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Vadunga inthawkin Philistin mihai ram le Aigupta ramri chenin ram po po chunga chun ro a rêl a; lâwm- manhai an hung chawi hlak a, Solomon dam sûng po chun a rawng an bâwl hlak a."
"And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,","Solomon ni khat fâk khawp chu beiphit inditak tekhâwng sâwmthum le, beiphit narân tekhâwng sâwmruk a nih;"

"And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.",Solomon varna chun khawsak nauhai po po varna le Aigupta mihai varna po po chu a khûm vawng a.

And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.,"Chun, Tura lal Hiram chun Solomon kuoma chun a siehlaw- hai a tir a, a pa aia lal dingin hriek an nâl ti a lo hriet sih a; Hiram chu David ngainatu a ni rawp hlak hrim a."
"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,","Chun, Solomon chun Hiram kuoma chun,"
"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.","“Ka pa David khan LALPAIN a hmêlmahai a ke hnuoia a sie hmakhat khan chu a vêl kil tin kil tanga indonahai lei khan, LALPA a Pathien hming dingin in a bâwl thei nawh ti i hriet a."
"But now Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.","Tu ruok hin chu LALPA ka Pathien chun kil tinah muongna a mîn neitir tah a, hmêlmahai khawm an um ta naw bawk a."
"And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name.","Chun, LALPA chun ka pa David kuoma, ‘I naupa i aia i lalṭhungpha kân hluotir ding chun ka hming dingin in chu la bâwl a tih,’ tia a lo hril ta ang khan, LALPA ka Pathien hming dinga in bâwl ka tum a."
Now therefore command thou that they cut me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that knoweth how to cut timber like unto the Sidonians.,"Chuongchun, Lebanon tlânga mi sidar thinghai mi phûrpêk dingin thu pe la, ka siehlawhai khawm i sie- hlawhai lai hung ṭhang vêng an ta; chun, i siehlawhai hlaw ding chu i hril ang taphawtin pe pei ka ti che; Zidon mihai anga thing phûr thiem keini lai tukhawm an um nawh ti i hriet sih a,” tiin mi a tir a."
"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.","Chun, Hiramin Solomon thu a lo hriet chun a lâwm ta êm êm el a, “Hieng mi tamtak chunga rorêl dinga naupa vartak David kuoma petu LALPA chu vawisûn hin inpâkin um raw se,” a ta."
"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the message which thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.","Chun, Hiram chun Solomon kuomah, “I thu mi hung incha chu ka lo hriet a, sidar thing thu le fâr thing chu i mamaw ang peiin lo thâwng ka tih."
"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.","Ka siehlawhaiin Lebanon tlânga inthawkin tuisuoriet chenin hung la thlâng an ta; chun, i hmun mi ruotpêk dinga tuisuorieta tawl dingin intêltir ka ta; chun, chu hmuna chun insuttir ka ta, nangin lo lâng i ta; chun, nang khawma ka sûngkuohai fâk ding tumin ka mamaw chu i lo phuhrûk ve thung ding annâwm,” tiin mi a tir a."
So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.,"Chuongchun, Hiram chun sidar thing le fâr thing chu Solomon chu a mamaw ang ang chun a pêk a."
"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.","Chun, Solomon chun Hiram chu a sûngkuohai fâk dingin bu tekhâwng sîng hni le hriek sâwr tekhâwng sâwmhni a pêk a, chu chu Solomonin kum tina Hiram a pêk ang dân chu a nih."
"And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.","Chun, LALPAIN a tiem ang ngeiin Solomon chu varna a pêk a, chun, Hiram le Solomon inkâra chun inremna a um a, an pahni chun thu an thlung ve ve tah a."
And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.,"Chun, lal Solomon chun Israel mihai po po laia chun mi sinthawa ruoi lui pâwl a siem a; ruoi lui pâwl chu mi sîng thum an nih."
"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork.","Lebanona chun thla khata in- thlâk peiin sîng khat a tir hlak a, thla khat Lebanona chun an hang um a, thla hni chu anni in tieng, Adoniram chu sinthawa ruoi luihai hotu a nih."
"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;","Chun, Solomon chun thil phur mi sîng sari le, lung sut mi sîng riet tlânghaia chun a nei a;"
"besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.","Chuonghai chu tiem loin Solomon chun a sin chunga hotubîk, sinthaw vêngtu sâng thum le za thum a nei bawk a."
"And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone.","Chun, lal thupêk angin lung- phûm chu lung sutsaa rem dingin lung lientak tak el, lung man tamtak takhai an hung lâk a."
"And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.","Chun, in bâwltuhai Solomon mihai le Hiram mihai le Gebal mihai chun lunghai chu an sut a, in bâwlna ding chun thing le lunghai chu an buotsai a."
"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.","Israel thlahai Aigupta rama an suok chena inthawk kum za li le kum sâwmrietna kum, Israelhai chunga Solomon inlal kum lina, Ziv thla, thla hninaa chun LALPA in bâwl chu a ṭan a."
"And the house which king Solomon built for Jehovah, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.","Chun, Solomonin LALPA ta dinga a in bâwl chu a dung tieng tawng sâwmruk a na, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhni a na, ân sâng tieng chu tawng sâwmthum a nih."
"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.","Chun, chu ina Hmun inthieng hmaa tuolpûk chu a in khang tieng chen tawng sâwmhnia sei a na, a hma tienga mi khang tieng chu tawng sâwm a nih."
And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work.,"Chun, ina chun tukverhai a sûnga inthawka a puotienga chîn zuihai chu a siem a."
"And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.","Chun, in bang vêlin, biekna in bang vêla khawm, biekna hmun inthieng bang vêla khawm chun, chu in bang sik chun in sâwng nei a bâwl a; chun, a vêl el chun pindanhai a siem a;"
"The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.","a sâwng hnuoi hnung tak chu a khang tieng tawng nga a na, a laia mi chu a khang tieng tawng ruk a na, a pathumna chu a khang tieng tawng sari a nih; kalkhanghai chu in banga chun rawl ngai loin, a puotienga chun a vêlin a bang hrûla chun ân nghatna a siem a."
"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.","Chun, in chu an bâwl lai chun, lung a chona hmuna sut sa vawnga bâwl a na, chuongchun, an bâwl sûng po chu tubau ri dâm, hreipui ri dâm, thîr hriemhrei ri hrim hrim chu ina chun hriet a ni nawh a."
"The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.","Pindan lailungtakhai kawtkhâr chu, chu in changtieng panga chun a um a, a laia chun kailâwn inhera hin an lâwn kai a; chun, a lailunga inthawk chun a pathumnaah."
"So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.","Chuongchun, in chu a hang bâwl a, a zo tah a, in chu sidar tlungpûm le a phêkin ân khum a."
"And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.","Chun, a in sâwng neihai chu in sik vawngin tawng nga senga insângin a bâwl a; chuonghai chu in le chun sidar thinga zawm a nih."
"And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Solomon kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.","“Hi in bâwl lai mêk chungchâng thu hi ka thuruothai i pawm a, ka rorêlhai i zâwm a, ka thupêk po pohai zâwm dinga i pawm phawt chun, i pa David kuoma ka lo hril tah ka thu kha i chungah sukdet ka tih."
"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.","Chun, Israel thlahai laia hin chêng ka ta, ka mi Israelhai hi thlathlam naw ning ah,” tiin."
"So Solomon built the house, and finished it.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun in chu a bâwl a, a zo tah a."
"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.","In sûng tienga bang ding chun sidar thingphêk a hmang a, a ṭuonga inthawka a inchung thuo bang chen chun thingphêk a bel vawng a, a ṭuonga chun fâr thing phêk a pha sah a."
"And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls of the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.","Chun, in chawrtieng pang tawng sâwmhni chu a ṭuonga in- thawka a bang chenin sidar thing- phêkhaiin a siem vawng a, a biekna hmun, Hmun Inthieng tak ta ding khawm chun a sûngtienga chun a hmang a."
"And the house, that is, the temple before the oracle, was forty cubits long.","Chun, biekna hmun hma tieng biek in sûng chu a dung tawng sâwm- li a na."
"And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.","Chun, insûng tienga chun a kumûm le a pâr, pâr lima ker mawi sidar thing a um a, a rêng chun sidar thing vawng a nih; lung hrim hrim ân lang nawh a."
"And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA thuthlung bâwm siena dingin a sûngah hmun in- thiengtak a buotsai a."
"And within the oracle was a space of twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.","Chun, chu hmun inthiengtak chu a dung tieng tawng sâwmhni, a khang tieng tawng sâwmhni, ân sâng tieng tawng sâwmhni a nih; chu chu rângkachak hlirhlakin ân luon a; chun, sidar maichâm chu ân luon bawk a."
So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.,"Chuongchun, Solomon chun chu in sûng tieng chu rângkachak in- thiengin ân luon vawng a; chun, hmun inthiengtak hma tieng chu rângkachak khaidiethaiin a daidan a; chu chu rângkachakin ân luon a."
"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.","Chun, in chu a rênga a zo chenin a pumin rângkachak inthiengin ân luon pei a; hmun inthienga maichâm pumpui khawm chu rângkachak inthiengin ân luon a."
"And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.","Chun, hmun inthienga chun tawng sâwmhni ve vea insângin cherub pahni Oliv thingin a siem a."
"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.","Cherub thla pakhat chu tawng nga a na, cherub thla khingtieng chu tawng nga bawk a nih; thla pakhat hmawra inthawka thla khingtieng hmawr inkâr chu tawng sâwm a nih."
And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.,"Cherub pakhat insângtieng chu tawng sâwm a na, cherubhai chu intie chie le pieng dân inang ve ve a nih."
"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.","Cherub pakhat insâng tieng chu tawng sâwm a na, cherub pakhat khawm chu, chu chen bawk chu a nih."
"And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.","Chun, cherubhai chu insûng ril lema chun a sieh a; chun, cherubhai thla chu ân zar a, pakhat thla chun bang khingtieng a va tâwk a, cherub pakhat thla khawm chun bang khing- tieng chu a tâwk bawk a; chu in lailungtaka chun an thla le an thla chu ân tâwk a."
And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.,"Chun, cherubhai chu rângka- chak inthiengin ân luon a."
"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.","In bang po po chu a vêlin cherubhai intûm thing le pâr par ta sa limhai leh, ker mawiin sûngtieng le a puotienga chun a siem a."
"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.",A in ṭuong chu sûngtieng le a puotienga chun rângkachak in- thiengin ân luon a.
And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel and door-posts were a fifth part of the wall.,"Chun, hmun inthiengtak lûtna dinga chun Oliv thingin kawtkhâr a siem a, kawtkhâr lu chung le kawt- khâr bienghai chu a bang hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat tie a nih."
"So he made two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.","Chuongchun, Oliv thingin kawtkhâr pahni a siem a, chutaka chun cherubhai, intûm thing le pâr par tasahai lim dâm ker mawiin a siem a, chuong chu rângkachakin ân luon a; chun, cherubhai le intûm thinghai chu rângkachak a nâl a."
"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;","Chun, biekin lûtna dingin bang hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat ruolin Oliv kawtkhâr ban a siem bawk a,"
"and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.","fâr thing kawtkhâr pahni leh; kawtkhâr pakhata phêk hni chu thlep thei a na, kawtkhâr pakhata phêk hnihai khawm chu thlep thei ma a nih."
And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.,"Chuonghaia chun cherubhai, intûm thinghai pâr par tasahai lim chu a ker a, chuong ker mawihai chu innâmtakin rângkachakin ân luon a."
"And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.",Biekin huon sûng tuollai sûng- ril lem chu lung sut sâwng thum le sidar thingphêk thuo khatin a siem a.
"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.","A kum lina Ziv thlaa chun LALPA in lungphûm chu rem a na,"
"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.","chun, kum sâwm le kum khatna Bul thla, thla rietnaah in chu remruot ang chiein, a iengkim chu zo vawng a na. Chuongchun, kum sari sûng a bâwl a nih."
"And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.","Solomon chun ama in chu kum sâwm le kum thum a bâwl a, a in chu a zo vawng a."
"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.","Lebanon Rampui In sidar ban tlar li, ban chunga sidar thingphêk chunga chun a bâwl bawk a; a dung- tieng chu tawng za a na, a khangtieng chu tawng sâwmnga a na, ân sâng- tieng chu tawng sâwmthum a nih."
"And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.","Chun, banhai sâwmli panga chunga innghat pindanhai chunga chun sidar thingphêkhaia inkhum a na, banhai chu tlar khata chun sâwm le panga pei a nih."
"And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.","Tlar thumin tukver a um a, var le varhai chu ân ep vawng a."
And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.,"Kawtkhârhai le banhai po po chu thingphêkin kil li neia siem a na, var le varhai chu tlar thumin ân ep vawng a."
"And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.","Chun, tuolpûk chu ban neiin a siem a, a dungtieng chu tawng sâwm- nga a na, a khangtieng chu tawng sâwmthum a na; chun, chuong hmaa- hai chun tuolpûk a siem a, banhai le a hmaa lûtna kailâwnhai leh."
"And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.","Chun, a rorêlna ding lalṭhung- pha tuolpûk, rorêlna tuolpûk chu a siem bawk a, chu chu ṭuong khing- tienga inthawka khingtieng chena sidar thinga inkhum a nih."
"And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch.","Chun, a umna dingin tuolpûk sûng, huon sûng tuollai danga um chu chuong ang bawk chun siem a na. Chun, Pharao naunu (Solomonin nu- hmeia a inei) chu tuolpûk ang bawk chun a in a bâwlpêk a."
"All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.","Chuong po po chu lung man tamtak tak, a huntâwk ang chiea sut, âtnaa âta bâwl a na, a sûngtieng khawm, a puotieng khawm, lung- phûma inthawka a lêr chenin; chun, chuong ang bawkin tuol tieng chun inhuon sûng tuolzâwl khawlai lientak chenin."
"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.","Chun, lungphûmhai chu lung man tamtak tak, lung lientak tak tawng sâwm dâm, tawng riet dâma rem a nih."
"And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.","Chun, chu chung tieng chu lung man tamtak tak, lung a huntâwk ang chiea sut le sidar thing a na."
"And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.","A vêlin inhuon sûng tuolzâwl lientak chu lung sut sâwmthum le Sidar thingphêk thuo khata inhuon a na; LALPA in inhuon sûng tuollai sûngril lem leh, in tuolpûk ang bawk khan."
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.,"Chun, lal Solomon chun mi a tir a, Tura khuoa inthawk chun Hiram a ko a."
"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.","Ama chu Naphtali hnam hmeithai nau a na, a pa chu Tura khuoa mi dâr suttu a na, ama dâr sut kawnga hrim hrim chun a varin a hrietthiemin a themthiem hle el a. Lal Solomon kuoma chun a feh a, a sin po po chu a thawpêk vawng a."
"For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.","Dâr ban pahni a sûng kaw- rawngin, tawng sâwm pariet ve vea insângin a siem a, a lienzie chu tawng sâwmpahni ve ve le inchi li ve vea saa inkuol a nih."
"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.","Ban sîpa sie dingin dâr sung bâwk pahni a siem a, bâwk pakhat insâng tieng chu tawng nga a na, bâwk pakhat insâng tieng khawm chu tawng nga bawk a nih."
"There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.","Ban sîpa bâwkhaia chun ṭiel chikchek le, inher chîlchielhai hi a um a, bâwk pakhata chun pasari a na, pakhat danga khawm chun pasari bawk."
"So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.","Chuongchun, banhai chu a siem a, chuong ban sîpa a bâwkhai tuomna ding chun ṭiel chikchek theibufaihai leh pakhat chunga chun a vêlin tlar hni a um a; chuong ang bawk chun bâwk pakhat chunga khawm chun ân umtir a."
"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.","Chun, tuolpûka ban sîphaia bâwka chun lili lim hi a chuong a, tawng li a nih."
"And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.","Chun, ban pahni sîpa bâwkhaia chun a reia ṭiel chikchek bul ela chun theibufaihai lim a um bawk a; chun, theibufaihai chu chuong bâwkhaia chun za hni ve vea intlarin a um a."
"And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.","Chun, biek in tuolpûkhaia chun banhai chu ân ngîrtir a, changtieng ban chu ân ngîr a, a hminga chun Jakin ân bûk a, chun, vawitieng ban chu ân ngîr a, a hminga chun Boaz ân bûk a."
And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.,"Chun, ban sîpa chun lili lim a chuong a; chuongchun, ban tieng sin chu zo a ni tah a."
"And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.","Chun, dâr tuizêng, a reia in- thawka a rei khingtieng chena tawng sâwm tla, ân sâng tieng tawng nga a sung a; a rei chu tawng sâwmthum biel vêl a nih."
"And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.","A rei hnuoia chun kumûm lim hin a vêlsuok a, tawng sâwm a na, tuizêng rei vêla chun a um a; chuong kumûmhai chu tlar hniin an um a; sung sa nghâl an nih."
"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.","Chu chu bâwngchal sâwm le pahni chungah ân nghat a, pathumin hmartieng an nghah a, pathumin thlangtieng an nghah a, pathumin simtieng an nghah a, pathumin saktieng an nghah a. Chun, zêng chu an chungah ân ṭhut a, an mei tieng chun sûng tieng chu a ngha seng a;"
"And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.","kutpha bawka sa a nih; a rei chu lili pâr ang, no rei anga siem a na, bath sâng hni keng a nih."
"And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.","Chun, inṭhutna sâwm dârin a siem a, inṭhutna pakhat seizie chu tawng li a na, a khangtieng chu tawng li bawk a na, ân sâng tieng chu tawng thum a nih."
And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;,"Chun, inṭhutnahai siem dân chu hieng ang hi a nih: chuonghai chun khur a nei a, a khurhai chu a reihai inkâra chun a um a;"
"and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.","chun, a reihai inkâra khurhaia chun sakeibakneihai, bâwngchalhai, cherubhai a chuong a; a rei chunga chun innghatna a um a; chun, sakeibakneihai le bâwngchal hnuoia chun cheimawinahai a um nghien a."
"And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.","Chun, inṭhutnahaia chun dâr tawlailîr pali le dâr kalru a um seng a, a kihai palia chun ân nghatna a um seng a, insâwpna bêl hnuoi tieng chun ân nghatna sunga sung a um a, a rei senga chun cheimawina a um seng a."
"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.","Chun, a suonkuol bau rei chu tawng khat tla a na, a rei tlâng chu suonkuol anga chêng a na, tawng khat le a chenve a nih, chun, a rei tlânghai chu cheimawi a na, a khur- hai chu kil li a na, a chêng nawh a."
And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.,"Chun, tawlailîr palihai chu a khur hnuoi tiengahai chun a um a; chun, tawlailîr kalruhai chu inṭhut- naahai chun a um a, tawlailîr insâng tieng chu tawng khat le a chenve a nih."
"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.","Chu tawlailîrhai siem dân chu sakawr tawlailîr ke siem dân ang hi a na, a tlungzamhai, a suonkuolhai, a sunkalnahai, a laibâwkhai chu sung vawng a nih."
And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.,"Chun, inṭhutna kil li senga chun innghatna pali a um a, chuong innghatnahai chu inṭhutna le chun pumkhat vawng an nih."
And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.,"Chun, inṭhutna chunga chun suonkuol, tawng chenvea insâng hi a um a, inṭhutna chunga ân ṭhutna kalhai le a khurhai chu pumkhat vawng an nih."
"And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.","Chun, ân ṭhutna kephêkahai le, a khurahai chun a lienzie ang peiin cherubhai, sakeibakneihai, intûm thinghai ân chuongtir a, a vêl chun cheimawina hi a um seng a."
"After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.","Chuong ang vawng chun in- ṭhutna sâwmhai chu a siem a, a rêng chun pakhata sung an ni vawng a, intie seng, siem dân inang vawng an nih."
And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.,"Chun, insâwpna bêl sâwm dârin a siem a, maihûn pakhat chun bath sâwmli a dawng a; maihûn chu tawng li seng a na, inṭhutna sâwm chunga chun maihûn pakhat chu ân ṭhut pei a."
"And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.","Chun, inṭhutnahai chu in changtieng chun panga ân ṭhut a, vawitieng panga chun panga, chun, tuizêng chu in changtieng panga saktienga sim nghain ân ṭhut a."
"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:","Chun, Hiram chun insâwpna bêlhai, vutluohai, maihûnhai a siem a."
"the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;","Chuongchun, Hiram chun LALPA in ta dinga Solomon a siem- pêk po po chu a zo vawng ta a; ban pahni dâm, ban sîpa bêl anga inbâwkhai pahni, ban sîpa bêl anga inbâwk tuomna ṭiel chikchekhai pahni,"
"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;","chu tuomna ṭiel chikchek ta dinga theibufai za lihai dâm, ban sîpa bêl anga inbâwk pahni tuomna dinga ṭiel chikchek ve ve ta dinga theibufai tlar hnihai kha;"
"and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;","chun, inṭhutna sâwm le inṭhut- na chunga insâwpna bêl sâwmhai dâm,"
"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;","tuizêng pakhat le tuizêng hnuoia sebâwngchal sâwm le pahni- hai dâm,"
"and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.","bêlhai, vutluohai le maihûnhai le dâm, chuong bûr le bêlhai po po Hiramin LALPA in dinga Solomon a siempêkhai chu dâr nâwt tlêt ruok a nih."
"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.","Jordan phaizâwlah, Sukkoth le Zarethan inkâra bepil hmunah a nih lalpa chun a sung chu."
"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.","Chun, Solomonin chuong, bûr le bêlhai po po chu a tam êm leiin bûk suok loin a sie el a, dâr bûk zât chu hriet suok ruol a ni nawh."
"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA ina bûr le bêl um po pohai chu a siem a, rângkachak maichâm le entirna bei siena dawkân chu rângkachakin;"
"and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;","chun, hmun inthieng hma zâwna khâwnvar siena changtienga panga le vawitienga panga chu râng- kachak inthiengin; pârhai le, khâwn- varhai le chaichehai chu rângkachak bawkin;"
"and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, of gold.","nohai, khâwnvar puon chepna- hai, maihûnhai, haihawhai, rimin- hnik thlêng, meilâknahai, rângka- chak hlîr hlak vawngin; in sûngril lem, hmun inthiengtak kawtkhâra- hai le, in (biek in chu) kawtkhâr inbûknahai chu rângkachakin."
"Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun LALPA in dinga a siem po po chu a zo ta vawng a.

"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Israel upahai le, an hnam lusahai po po dâm, Israel thlahai sûngkuo upahai chu Jerusalem khuoa lal Solomon kuoma chun David khawpui Ziona inthawkin LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwn dingin a ko khâwm tâwl a."
"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.","Chun, Israel mi po pohai chu Ethanim thla (thla sarinaa chun) ruoiṭhenaah lal Solomon kuoma chun an inkhâwm ṭeu tâwl a."
"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.","Chun, Israel upahai po po chu an hung a, thiempuhai chun bâwm chu an zâwn a."
"And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.","LALPA bâwm le inbiekna puon in le, puon ina bûr le bêl inthienghai po po chu an zâwn a; chuonghai chu thiempuhai le Levi chihai chun an zâwn a."
"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.","Chun, lal Solomon le Israel mi pungkhâwm po po, a kuoma hung inkhâwmhai chu bâwm hmaa chun an um tâwl a; berâm le bâwngchal a tam leia tiem sêng ruol lo le a zât hriet sêng ruol lo chun an inthâwi a."
"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.","Chuongchun, thiempuhai chun LALPA thuthlung bâwm chu a umna dinga chun an lâklût a, in sûnga biekna hmun, hmun inthiengtakah, cherubhai thla hnuoia chun."
"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.",Cherubhai chun bâwm umna chung zâwna chun an thlahai an zâr zing sih a; cherubhai chun bâwm le a zâwnfunghai chu an huop vawng a.
And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.,"Chun, a zâwnfunghai chu a sei khawp a, a zâwnfung hmawrhai chu biekna hmun hma, hmun inthienga inthawk chun ân hmu thei a: tuola inthawk ruok chun ân lang nawh; tu chen hin chutaka chun a la um zing a nih."
"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.","Aigupta rama inthawka an suok a, LALPAIN Israel thlahai kuoma thu a thlung laia Mosiein Horeb tlânga lungphêk pahni a siehai chau naw kha chu, chu bâwm sûnga chun iengkhawm a um nawh."
"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,","Chun, thiempuhai chu hmun inthienga inthawka an hung suok phingle chun LALPA in chu sûm chun a hung sip ta mup el a;"
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.,"chuongchun, sûm lei chun thiempuhai chu rawngbâwlin an um thei ta naw hiel a, LALPA ropuinain LALPA in chu a suksip vawng ta sih a."
"Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun thu a hril tah a, “LALPAIN, ‘Inthim sa- mupa chun um ka tih,’ a ti hrim a."
"I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.","I chêngna ding in, kumkhuoa i umna ding in ka bâwlpêk ta che a ni hi,” a ta."
"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.","Chun, lal chu a hnungtieng chun a nghah a, Israel hung pung- khâwmhai po po chu mal a sâwm a, chuongchun, Israelhai pungkhâwm- hai po po chu an ngîr ṭhuop a."
"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,","Chun, ama chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien, ka pa David kuom- a ama bau ngei a,"
"Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.","‘Aigupta rama inthawka ka mi Israelhai ka ṭhuoi suok nia inthawkin Israelhai hnam laia khâwlai khuo khawm hi ka hming umna dinga in bâwlna dingin ka la thlang ngai nawh a, amiruokchu, ka mi Israelhai hotu ding chun David hi ka thlang a nih,’ tia lo hriltu ama kut ngeia hung suk- puitlingtu hi inpâkin um raw se."
"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Ka pa David khan Israelhai Pathien, LALPA hming ta dinga in bâwl a lungrilin a lo tum hlak a."
"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN ka pa David kuoma chun, ‘I lungrila chun ka hming ta dinga in bâwl i tum hlak a, hieng ang lungril i lo put hi i thaw ṭha a;"

"And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chun, LALPAIN a thuhril chu a hung sukdet tah a; LALPA lo tiem ta ang ngeiin ka pa David hmun chu ka lo hluo tain, Israel lalṭhungphaa chun ka lo ṭhung tah a; Israelhai Pathien, LALPA hming ta dingin in chu ka lo bâwl ta ngei sih a."

"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;","“Aw LALPA, Israelhai Pathien, i siehlaw an lungril po poa um ṭhahai kuoma thuthlung hlena lunginsietna suklang hlaktu, i siehlaw ka pa David kuoma thutiem hlentu, chungtieng vâna le hnuoitieng hnuoia hin nangma ang hi Pathien dang hrim hrim an um dêr nawh;"

"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.","Chuongchun, aw LALPA Israel- hai Pathien, i siehlaw ka pa David kuomah, ‘I thlahai chu ka mithmua i um anga ka mithmua um ve dinga an um dâna an fîmkhur phawt chun ka mithmuah Israelhai lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding tlasam naw ti nih,’ tia i lo tiem ta kha hung hlen la."

"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.","Chu ni ma chun lal chun LALPA in hma zâwna inhuon sûng tuollai chu a sukthieng a, chutaka chun LALPA hmaa dâr maichâm chu pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, beiphit thilinhlân dâm, inremna thilinhlân sa thâu dâm siena dinga a chîn talaw leiin, pumrawhmanga thil inhlân dâm, beiphit thil inhlân dâm, inremna sa thâu thil inhlân dâm ân hlân sih a."
