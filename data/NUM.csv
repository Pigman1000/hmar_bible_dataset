"Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?","Berâm ruol le ran ruol khawm thatpêk ta ang inla, an khawp ding am a nih? Tuisuorieta nga po po khawm manpêk inla, an khawp ding am a nih?” a ta."

"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu a suok a, LALPA thu chu mipuihai chu a hril a; mipuihai upahai sâwmsari chu a ko khâwm a, puon in vêla chun ân ngirtir a."
"And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu sûma chun a hung ṭum a, a hung biek a, amaa thlarau chu upa sâwmsari hai chunga chun a sieh a.

"But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.","Amiruokchu, bûka chun mi pahni an um a, pakhat hming chu Eldad a na, mi dang hming chu Medad a nih; thlarau chu an chungah a um a, tiemhai laia ṭhang chu an na, puon ina ruok chun an va fe ve nawh a; bûka chun thu an hril a."
"And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl pakhat a va tlân a, Mosie a va hril a, “Eldad le Medad chun bûkah thu an hril an hril el,” a va ta."
"And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.","Chun, Nun naupa Josua, a tleirâwl tira inthawka Mosie rawng- bâwltu chun a dawn a, “Pu Mosie, khap el rawh,” a ta."

"And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu bûka chun a lût nâwk a, ama le Israel mi upahai le chun."
"And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.","Chun, LALPA kuoma inthawk chun thli a hung hrâng a, tuisuorieta inthawk chun vamîm a hung lên a, bûk khingtieng ni khat lam, khing- tienga ni khat lam bawk dâpin bûk vêla chun tawng hni laia insângin ân tlâktir a."
"And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.","Mipuihai chun chu ni sûn- nithlâk le zânkhawvar le, a zingah sûnnithlak chun vamîm chu an va rût khâwm a; a rût tlâwm tak khawma homer sâwm a rût a, bûk vêla chun mâni ta dingin an em seng a."
"While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.","Chun, chu sa chu an fâk lai, an la fâk zo hmain, mipuihai chungah LALPA lung chu a hung chawk tah a, mipuihai chu hripui nasatakin LALPAIN a hrem tah a."

From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.,"Chun, Kibroth-hattaavaa in- thawk chun mipuihai chu Heze- rothah an feh a, Hezerotha chun an um tah a."
And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.,Miriam le Aron chun Mosien Kus mi nuhmeia a nei leiin an hrilsiet a; Kus mi chu a nei ngei sih a.
"And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.","Anni chun, “Mosie kuoma chau hin am a nih LALPAIN thu a hril bîk? Keini kâwla khawm hin a hril naw am a nih?” an tih a. Chu chu LAL- PAIN a lo hriet a."

"And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting.

"And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.","Ama chun, “Ka thu hi ngai ro, nangni lai hin zâwlnei in um chun ama chu kei LALPA hi inlârnain inhriettir ka ta, mang tieng bieng ka tih."

And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them; and he departed.,"Chuongchun, LALPA lung chu an chungah a chawk a, a fe nâwk tah a."
"And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.","Puon in chunga sûm chu ân kieng tah a; chun, ngai ta, Miriam chu vûr ang ela vârin a hung inphâr tah a; Aron chun Miriam chu a hei en a, inphâr a lo ni ta zing el ti a hmuh a."

"And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun, “Aw Pathien, sukdam nâwk ta khai,” tiin LALPA chu a ko a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “A pain a hmaia chil a sâk ngawt khawma ni sari chu ân zak naw ding am a nih?

"And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.","Chu zoa chun mipuihai chu Hazerotha inthawk chu an suok a, Paran thlalêrah umhmun an khuor a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie a biek a,"

These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.,Hieng hi ram enthla dinga Mosien a tirhai hming chu a nih. Nun naupa Hosea chu Mosie chun Josua tiin a thleng a.
"And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Kanaan ram enthla dingin anni rawi chu a tir a, an kuomah, “Simtieng fe phawt unla, tlângram tieng chun fe pei unla."

"and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.","Chun, huoitakin um unla, chu rama theirahai chu hung phur ro,” a ta. Grêp ra hmasa ra hun lai tak a nih."
"So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.","Chuongchun, an hang suok tah a, ram chu Zin thlalêra inthawka Hamath lûtna Rehob chenin an enthlâk vawng a."
"And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)","Simtienga chun an hang fe phawt a, Hebron an va tlung a, chutaka chun Anak thlahai, Ahiman mihai, Sesai mihai, Talmai mihai an um a, (Hebron chu Aigupta rama Zoan inngir hma kum saria inngir tah a nih)."
"And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; they brought also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.","Chun, Eskol ruom an va tlung a, chutaka grêp ra bâwr khat a kâu pumin an sât bawng a, hmawlin mi pahniin an zâwn a; theibufaihai le theichanghai an hâwn bawk a."

And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.,"An ram va enthlâk chu ni sâwmli an thang a, an hung kîr nâwk tah a."
"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.","Chuongchun, Paran thlalêra Kades a chun Mosie le Aron le Israel thla mipui po po kuom chu an hung tlung a, chu ram theihai chu an inentir a."
"And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.","Mosie kuomah, “I mi tirna rama chun kan feh a, nênêtui le khuoizu luongna a lo ni ngei el; hi hi a rama thei a nih."

"Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.","Amalek mihai chu sim rama chun an um a, Hit mihai, Jebus mihai, Amor mihai chu tlângahai chun an um a; chun, Kanaan mihai chu tuisuoriet pang le Jordan vadung pangah an um,” tiin an hril a."
"And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.","Amiruokchu, Kaleb chun, Mosie hmaa mipui chu a sukto ṭhuop a, “Hang inthawk vak ei tiu khai, hang la el ei tiu, hne ngei ngei ei tih,” a ta."

"And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai kuoma chun an ram hang enthlâk chu, “Ram enthla dinga kan hei fang chu, a sûnga umhai fa zo hmang a na, chun, a umhai kan hmuhai khawm chu mi âwmkhautak tak el an na;"

"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.","Chuongchun, a pungkhâwm- hai po po chu rawl insuo meuin an ṭap a; chu zân chun mipuihai chu an ṭap an ṭap el a."
"And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!","Israel thlahai po po chu Mosie le Aron chunga chun an chier a; a pungkhâwmhai po po chun an kuomah, “Aigupta rama khan mi lo sukhlum thên kha ni ta lem sien aw!

"And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?",Ieng dinga kâwlhnâma thi el dinga Pathienin hi rama hi mi ṭhuoi am a nih aw?

"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.","Chuongchun, an inbiek tâwl a, “Hotu siem ei tiu khai, Aigupta ramah kîr nâwk el ei tiu,” an tih a."
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.,"Chuongchun, Mosie le Aron chu Israel thla mipui pungkhâwm po pohai hmaa chun an bawkkhup a."
"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:","Chun, Nun naupa Josua le Jephunne naupa Kaleb, ram enthla- tuhai laia ṭhang vehai chun an puonhai an keithlêr a;"

"If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.","Ei chunga hin LALPA a lâwm chun, chu rama chun mi ṭhuoi a ta, mi pêng a tih; nênêtui le khuoizu luong- na ram chu."
"Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.","LALPA chungah hel naw phawt el unla, chu rama mihai khawm chu ṭi hlek naw ro, ei bu ding an ni el annâwm, an inhumhimna chu teplo mei mei a nih; LALPA chu ei kuomah a um annâwm; anni chu ṭi naw ro,” tiin an hril a."
But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.

"Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,","Hieng mipuihai hi i sukhlum phier chun i hming inthang hretu hnamhai chun,"

But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"Levi mihai ruok chu Israel thlahai laia tiem an ni ve nawh, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
"Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.","Chuong ang chun Israel thlahai chun an thawh a; LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang peiin a pâwl pâwlin an zar a, chun, chuong ang bawkin a chi chiin, a sûngkuo peiin an suok hlak."

And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.,Pungkhâwmhai chun tui an nei ta nawh a. Mosie le Aron chungchâng thuah an inhâwrkhâwm ngiel a.
"And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!","Chun, mipui chun, “LALPA hmaa ei unauhai an thi lai khan Pathienin mi lo sukhlum ve thên lem ta sien aw!"

"Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie chu, “Hmawl la la, pungkhâwmhai chu inumkhâwmtir la, nang le i unau Aron leh, an mithmuah lungpui chu a tui suksuok dingin hril la, lungpuia inthawk chun tui la suokpêk i ta; chuongchun, pungkhâwmhai le an ranhai chu în dâwntir ding annâwm,” tiin a biek a."
"And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.",Mosie chun LALPA hmaa in- thawk chun hmawl chu a thupêk ang chun a lâk a.
"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?","Mosie le Aron chun pung- khâwmhai chu lungpui bula chun an inumkhâwmtir a, an kuomah, “Mi hel hmanghai, ngai ta u, hi lungpuia inthawk hin tui kan lâk suokpêk ding cheu am a nih?” an ta."
"And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.","Mosie chun a bân a phar a, lungpui chu a hmawl chun vawi hni a hang vuok a; chuongchun, tui a hung suok ta zur zur el a, pungkhâwmhai le an ranhai chun an dâwn tah a."

"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.","Lunginsiettakin i ram hi fe thleng kan tih; lo amanih, grêp huon amanihah fe naw ning unga a, tuisunsuo tuihai dâwn bawk naw ning ung; lal lamlienah fe pei kan ta, i ram kan khêl hmakhat chun chang- tieng amanih, vawitieng amanih khawm pêt naw ning ungah,’ tiin,” a ta."

Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.,"an fe chu a phal ta nawh a, chuongchun, Israel mihai chun an kîrsan nâwk tah a."
"And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.","Chuongchun, Kadesa inthawk chun an suok a, Israel thla mipui po pohai chun Hor tlâng an va tlung a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie le Aron chu Edom ram dep Hor tlânga chun a biek a, “Aron chu a chipuihai kuoma ṭhuoi nîng a tih;"

"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aron chu a silfênhai a hlîppek a, Eleazar ân siltir a, chun, Aron chu tlâng sîpa chun a thi tah a; chun, Mosie le Eleazar chu tlânga inthawk chun an hung thla a."

"And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spake unto him.","Chuongchun, intuokna puon ina ama be dinga Mosie a lût chun thuthlung bâwm chunga zângaina ṭhungpha chungtienga cherub pahni- hai inkâra inthawk chun ama hung bein rawl a hriet a; rawl chun a biek tah a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
"Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.","“Aron hril la, a kuomah, ‘Khâwnvarhai chu i sitin khâwnvar pasari chun sathâu khâwnvar siena hmatieng a ên ding a nih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."

"And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which Jehovah had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.","Hi khâwnvar siena siem dân chu rangkachak, a suta sut a nih, a ngul bul le a pâr chena sut a nih; LALPAIN Mosie ân entir ang chiein khâwnvar siena chu a siem a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
"Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.","“Levi mihai chu Israel thlahai laia inthawkin suktum la, sukthieng rawh."
"And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.","Anni chu sukthieng dingin hieng ang hin i thaw ding a nih; an chungah intlêng faina tui infar la, an taksa po po chu invâwtir la; an puonhai insâwptir la, insukthiengtir rawh."
"Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.","Bâwngchal tuoi pakhat, a fâkmi thilinhlân, hrieka pawl beiphit inditak leh inlâktir la; suol thâwina dingin bâwngchal tuoi dang pakhat i kei bawk ding a nih."
And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:,"Levi mihai chu intuokna puon in bula chun ṭhuoi la, Israel thlahai mipui po po chu inpungkhâwmtir vawng rawh;"
and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:,"chun, Levi mihai chu LALPA kuomah inhlân i ta; Israel thlahai chun Levi mihai chunga chun an kuthai innghat an ta,"
"and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.","chuongchun, Aron chun Levi mihai chu LALPA rawng an bâwl theina dingin Israel thlahai hmingin a thêna thên thilinhlânah LALPA kuomah inhlân a tih."
"And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.","Levi mihai chun bâwngchal luahai chun an kut innghat an ta; chun, Levi mihai ta dinga inremna siemna dingin, pakhat chu suol thâwina dingin, pakhat chu pumraw- hmang thilinhlâna dingin LALPA kuomah în hlân ding a nih."
"And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto Jehovah.",Levi mihai chu Aron le a naupasalhai hmaa chun inumtir i ta; LALPA ta dinga a thêna thên thilinhlânah în hlân ding a nih.
Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.,"Chuong ang chun Israel thlahai laia inthawkin Levi mihai chu suktum i ta, chuongchun, Levi mihai chu ka ta nîng an tih."
"And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.","Chu zoa chun Levi mihai chu intuokna puon ina rawngbâwl dingin lût an ta; nangin anni chu sukthieng i ta, a thêna thên thilinhlânah în hlân ding a nih."
"For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.",Israel thlahai laia ka chanpuol dinga ruot an ni sih a; sul hung kêu ta po po Israel thlahai nau lutir po po aiah ka chanpuola ka nei tah a nih.
"For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.","Israel thlahai laia nau lutir po po chu ka ta an ni hrim a, mi- hriem ni leh, ran ni leh; Aigupta rama nau lutir po po ka sukhlum lai khan ka chanpuolah ka ruot tah a nih."
And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai lai nau lutir po po aiah Levi mihai hi ka nei tah a nih."
"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai aia intuokna puon ina rawngbâwl ding le, Israel thlahaiin hmun inthieng an hung hnai khawma Israel thlahai laia hri ân lêng nawna dinga inremna siem dingin Israel thlahai laia inthawkin Levi mihai hi Aron le a naupasalhai ka pêk a nih,” tiin."
"Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.","Chuong ang chun Mosie hai, Aron hai, Israel thlahai pung- khâwmhai po po chun Levi mihai chunga chun an thawh a; Levi mihai chungchâng thua LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang po po chun an chungah Israel thlahai chun an thawh a."
"And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai chu suola inthawk chun an insukthieng a, an puonhai an sâwp a; chun, Aron chun LALPA hmaa a thêna thên thilinhlân dingin ân hlân a; chun, anni chu sukthiengna ding Aronin inremna a siempêk a."
"And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.","Chun, chu zoa chun Levi mihai chu Aron le a naupasalhai hnuoia an rawngbâwl sin thaw ding chun intuokna puon in sûnga chun an lût a; Levi mihai chungchâng thua LALPA- IN Mosie thu a pêk angin an chunga chun an thaw tah a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:,"“Levi mihai chanpuol chu hieng hi a nih, kum sâwmhni panga chen chungtieng chun intuokna puon ina rawngbâwlna sin thâwng an ta;"
"and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,","kum sâwmnga mihai chun chu rawngbâwl sin chu châwlsan an ta, rawngbâwl ta naw ni hai."
"but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.","Amiruokchu, intuokna puon in enkawl thua chun an unauhai ṭhang- pui pei an ta, rawng ruok chu bâwl ta naw ni hai. Hieng ang hin Levi mihai chu an sin ding i rêlpêk ding a nih,” tiin."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,","LALPA chun Aigupta rama in- thawka an suok chen kum hnina thla khatnaah Sinai thlalêra chun Mosie a biek a,"
Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.,“Israel thlahai chun Fekân ruoiṭhe chu a hunbi peiah nei raw se.
"In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.","A hunbiah, hi thla ni sâwmpali zântieng in nei ding a nih; chu- taka thaw dinga ruot ang po po le, a dân ang po po chu in nei ding a nih,” tiin."
"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Israel thlahai chu Fekân ruoiṭhe chu nei dingin a hril a."
"And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Sinai thlalêra chun thla khatna ni sâwmpali ni zântieng fekân ruoiṭhe chu an nei tah a; LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang po po chun Israel thlahai chun an thawh a."
"And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:","Chun, tuhai amanih mithi ruong leia thieng naw an lo um a. Chu ni chun fekân ruoiṭhenaa chun an ṭhang ve thei nawh a. Chuongchun, chu ni chun Mosie le Aron hmaa chun an feh a."
"and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel?","Chuonghai chun a kuomah, “Mithi ruong leiin kan inthieng naw a ni tah a, iengleiin am Israel thlahai laia a hunbia LALPA kuoma thilin- hlân kan inhlân ding in mi khap a na?” an tih a."
"And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.","Mosie chun an kuomah, “Lo to ta u, in chungchâng thuah LALPAIN ieng angin am thu a pêk ding hang hre phawt ei tih,” a ta."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah.","“Israel thlahai kuomah, ‘Nang- ni laia mi khawm, in thlahai laia mi khawm, mithi ruong leia thieng naw amanih, lo thanghmang amanih an um hlau chun LALPA ta dinga Fekân ruoiṭhe chu an nei ve hrim hrim ding a nih."
In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:,Thla hnina ni sâwmpali ni zântieng an nei ding a nih. Chawl ṭhanglo bei hlohna kha leh an fâk ding a nih.
"they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.","A zînga dingin a iengkhawm an sie ding a ni nawh a, a ru khawm an sukthliek ding a ni bawk nawh; Fekân ruoiṭhe thaw dinga ruot ang po po chu an thaw ding a nih."
"But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.","Amiruokchu, thieng si, thang- hmangna khawm nei chuong loa Fekân ruoiṭhea ṭhang lo chu a chipuihai laia inthawk sât thlâk nîng a ta; a hunbia LALPA kuoma thilin- hlân chu ân hlân naw leiin ama chun a suol maw chu phur a tih."
"And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land.","Chun, hnam dang mi in kuoma umin, LALPA ta ding Fekân ruoiṭhea ṭhang ve a nuom chun Fekân ruoi- ṭhea thaw dinga ruot le a dân angin an thaw ding a nih; hi rama mi hrim hrim le hnam dang mihai ta dingin dân angkhat in nei ding a nih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta."
"And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.","Chuongchun, biekbûk indin ni chun biekbûk, inhriettirna puon in chu sûmin a tuom mup a, chun, zântieng chun biekbûk chunga chun meichawk ang el hi a zîng zîngkâr chenin a um a."
"So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.","Chuong ang chun a um zing a; sûm chun a tuom zing a, zâna chun mei angin ân lâng a."
"And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.","Sûmin puon in chu ân kiengsan po leh, Israel thlahai chun fe zai an rêl hlak a; chun, sûm a ngirna hmuna phawt chun Israel thlahai chun umhmun an khuor hlak."

"And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.","A châng chun sûm chu biekbûk chunga chun sâwt nawtê chau a um hlak a; chuongchun, LALPA thupêk angin an fe hlak."
"And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.","A châng chun sûm chu zân- tienga inthawkin zîngtieng chen a um a; chun, zîngkâra sûm chu ân vawr sâng chun an fe hlak a; ni khat chau amanih, zân khat chau amanih uma sûm chu ân vawr sâng chun an fe el hlak a."
"Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.","Biekbûk chungah sûm chu ni hni amanih, thla khat amanih, kum khat amani khawm a um chun, chutaka a um zing chun Israel thla- hai chun umhmun an khuor zing a, an fe ngai nawh a; ân vawr sâng ruok chun an fe hlak."
