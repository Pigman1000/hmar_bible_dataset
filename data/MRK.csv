"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",Pathien Naupa Isu Krista Chanchin Ṭha hung tlung phutna chu.
"Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way;","Zâwlnei Isai lekhabua, “Ngai ta, ka tirko i hmaah ka tir a, Ama chun i lampui siem a tih,”"
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;","Thlalêra mi khêk râwl chun, ‘Lalpa lamlien buotsai unla, A lampuihai suktlûn ro,’ a tih,” tia inziek ang khan."
"John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.","Johan, thlalêra Baptistu kha suksuolnahai ngaidamna dingin sim- na baptisma thu hrilin a hung suok a."
"And there went out unto him all the country of Judæa, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.","Chun, Judai rama mi po po le Jerusalema mi po pohai chu a kuomah an feh a, an suolhai thupha chawiin Jordan vadungah a kuomah baptisma an chang tâwl a."
"And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.","Chun, Johan chu sanghâwngsei hmul puonin ân thuom a, a kâwngah savun kâwngkhiin ân khit a, rama khuoizu le khâuṭhikṭhi buin a ring a."
"And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.","Chun, “Ka hnungah keia nêka ropui lem a hung zing a nih; kûna a kekawk hrui sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh."
I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.,"Kei chun tuiin ka baptis hlak cheu a; ama ruok chun chu Thlarau Inthiengin a baptis ding cheu a nih,” tiin a hril a."
"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.","Chuong nihaia chun Isu Galili rama Nazaretha inthawkin a hung a, Jordan vadungah Johan kuomah baptisma a chang tah a."
"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:","Chuongchun, tuia inthawka a hung suok phingle chun, vân in- hawnga Thlarau vâṭhu angin ama chunga hung ṭum a hmu tah a."
"and a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.","Chun, “Nang ka Naupa dittak i nih, i chungah ka lungni bêk bêk a nih,” tiin vâna inthawkin râwl a hung suok a."
And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.,Chu phingleh Thlarau chun thlalêrah ama a tir suok tah a.
And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.,"Chuongchun, Setan ithlêmin ni sâwmli zet thlalêra chun a um a, ramsahai lai a um a, vântirkohai chun a rawng an bâwlpêk a."
"Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,","Chun, Johan an man hnungin Isu, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha hrilin Galili ramah a hung a;"
"and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.","“Hun chu a hung tlung tah a, Pathien ram khawm a hung hnai tah a, sim unla Chanchin ṭha hi ring ro,” a ti pei a."
"And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.","Chun, Galili dîl panghrûla a fe laiin Simon le Simon unaupa Andri chu dîla chun lên dêngin a hmuh a; nga mantu an ni hrim a."
"And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Mi zui ro, chuongchun, mihriem mantu dingin siem ka ti cheu,” a ta."
"And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.","Chuongchun, lênhai chu mâk- sanin an zui tah a."
"And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.","Chun, tâwite a hei fe chun, Zebedai naupa Jakob le a unau Johan chu a hmuh a, anni khawm chu an lênhai siemṭhain lawnga bawk an um a."
"And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.","Chun, anni khawm chu a ko nghâl tah a: chuongchun, an pa Zebedai chu inhlawfa an iruoihai kuoma chun lawngah an mâksan a, an zui tah a."
And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.,"Chun, Kapernaumah an va feh a, chun Châwlni chun inkhâwmna inah a lût a, ân chûktir nghâl tah a."
"And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.","A thu inchûktir chu mak an ti hle a, Dân inchûktirtuhai ang loa, thuneina nei taka anni ân chûktir leiin."
"And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,","Chun, an inkhawmna ina chun khawhri inthieng naw nei mi pakhat a lo um a;"
"saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.","ama chun, “Nazareth Isu, keini le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna a um a? Mi sukbohmang dingin i hung am a nih? Nang ka hriet che, Pathien mi inthieng i nih,” tiin a khêk suok nghâl tah a."
"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.","Chun, Isûn a hal a, “To la, a sûnga inthawkin hung suok rawh,” a ta."
"And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.","Chun, khawhri inthieng naw chun ama a sawisah a, inringtakin a khêk a, a sûnga chu a hung suok tah a."
"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.","Chun, an rêngin mak an ti ta bêk bêk a, chuongchun, “Ahi ieng am a ni ta leh, inchûktirna thar a ni hi tên! Khawhri inthieng naw khawm thuneitakin thu a pêk a, a thu an awi pei el hi,” tiin an insêl a."
And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.,"Chun, Galili ram vêl po poah, ram tinah a chanchin ân thang nghâl tah a."
"And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.","Chun, inkhâwmna ina inthawk- a an suok chun, Simon le Andri inah Jakob leh Johan leh an lût a."
Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:,"Chun, Simon tarpinu khaw- sikin a nah a, a lo zâl a; chuongchun, a umzie chu Isu an hril nghâl tah a;"
"and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.","chun, ama chun, a kut a va chel a, a keitho tah a. Chuongchun, a khawsik chu a bo tah a, an rawng a bâwlpêk tah a."
"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.","Chun, zântienga nisa tlâk hnung chun, damnaw po po le khaw- hri iman dâm a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
And all the city was gathered together at the door.,A khuo chun kawtkhâr bulah an hung inkhâwm tup el tah a.
"And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.","Chuongchun, mi tamtak natna tinrêng invawihai chu a sukdam a, khawhri tamtak a hnawt suok bawk a; khawhrihai chun ama an hriet leiin an ṭawng a phal nawh a."
"And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.","Chun, zîngkâr inhmatakin, khawvar hma daiin a tho a, a suok a, hmun fienrielah a va feh a, chutaka chun a ṭawngṭai a."
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;,"Chun, Simon le a ruolhai chun an hnawtzui a;"
"and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.","ama an va hmu chun, a kuomah, “Mi po poin an zawng che i sawnnâwm ie,” an ta."
"And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hmun danga khaw hnaiahai dâm chun fêng ei tiu, chuonga hai khawm chun thu ka hril theina dingin, hi lei taka hung ka ni nghâl a,” a ta."
"And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.","Chuongchun, thu hrila, khaw- hrihai khawm hnawt suok peiin Galili ram po poa an inkhâwmna inahai chun a lût pei a."
"And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","Chun, a kuomah phâr a hung a, “I nuom chun i mi sukthieng thei,” a ta, a hmaah a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a ngên rak el a."
"And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.","Ama chun a lo lunginsiet bêk bêk a; a hei ban a, a them a, “Ka nuom ie, sukthiengin lo um ta rawh,” a ta."
"And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.","Chuongchun, kârloin ân phârna chu a bo nghâl el tah a, a hung inthieng tah a."
"And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,","Chun, ama chu hril lo dingin a tiem tlat a, ân fetir tah a;"
"and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","a kuomah, “Tu kuoma khawm iengkhawm va hril dêr naw raw kha; nisienlakhawm, thiempu kuomah vân entir la, an hriet fel theina dingin Mosie thil ruothai kha i înthienna dingin vân hlân rawh,” a ta."
"But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu a suok a, tlânginsamin chu thu chu a phuong dar phut el tah a; chuongchun, Isu chu inphuongtakin khuo a lût thei ta nawh a; thlalêr hmunahai a um lem tah a; chun hmun tina mi a kuomah an hung hlak a."
"And he arose from thence, and cometh into the borders of Judæa and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.","Chun, a tho a, chutaka inthawk chu Judai ram le Jordan râlah a fe tah a; chun, mi- puihai chu a kuomah an hung inkhâwm nâwk a, chuongchun, a thaw dân ta ang rawpin a lo inchûktir nâwk a."
"And there came unto him Pharisees, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? trying him.","Chun, Pharisaihai ṭhenkhat a kuomah an hung a, ama fiena dingin “Mîn a nuhmei a mâk a thieng am?” tiin an indawn a."
"And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Mosien iengtin am thu a pêk cheu a?” tîn a dawn a."
"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.","Chun, anni chun, “Mosie chun inmâkna lekha inziekin mâk a phal hlak a nih,” an tih a."
"But Jesus said unto them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn an kuomah, “In lungril ngar leiin a nih in sawnnaw chu thu chu ân ziekpêk cheu chu."
"But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them.","Nisienlakhawm, leilung insîeng tîra inthawk chun, ‘Anni chu nuhmei le pasalin a siem a nih,’"
"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;","‘Chuleichun, pasalin a nu le pa mâksan a ta, a nuhmei chel a ta;"
"and the two shall become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.","chuongchun, an pahni chun tisa pumkhat lo ni tâng an tih, chuongchun, pahni an ni ta nawh a, tisa pumkhat an lo ni ta lem a nih’."
"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.","Chuleiin, Pathienin a izawm ta hnung chu mihriemin ṭhe naw raw se,” a ta."
And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.,"Chun, ina chun, a închûk- tirhaiin chuong thu chu an indawn nâwk a."
"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her:","Ama chun an kuomah, “Tû- khawm a nuhmei mah a, mi dang nei taphawt chun a nuhmei chu a retsan a nih;"
"and if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.","ama khawm chun a pasal inṭhepuia mi dang a nei chun a uire a ni bawk,” a ta."
"And they were bringing unto him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.","Chun, a ithem dingin naupang- tehai an hung ṭhuoi a; chun, inchûktirhai chun an lo hal a."
"But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn chu chu a hmuin a lung a ni naw bêk bêk a, an kuoma chun, “Naupangtêhai ka kuomah inhungtir unla, khap naw ro; Pathien ram chu hieng ang mihai ta a ni sih a."
"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu, tû- khawm Pathien ram chu naupang- têin a lâwm anga lâwm naw phawt chu a sûngah lût naw tawp an tih,” a ta."
"And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.","Chun, annirawi chu a hang kuoh a, an chungah kut innghatin mal a sâwmpêk tah a."
"And as he was going forth into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?","Chun, fe dinga a suok laitakin mi pakhat a kuom tieng a hung tlân a, a hmaah a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a kuom- ah, “Inchûktirtu ṭha, kumkhuoa hringna ka nei theina dingin ieng am thâwng ka ta?” tiin ân dawn a."
"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good save one, even God.","Chun, Isu chun a kuomah, “Iengdinga ṭha i mi ti? Mi pakhat chau naw chu tukhawm ṭha an um nawh, chu chu Pathien a nih."
"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor thy father and mother.","Thupêkhai chu i hriet annâwm: ‘Tuol that naw, Uire naw, Inru naw, Hrietpuina inkhêl pe naw, Hlêm naw, I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ tihai hi,” a ta."
"And he said unto him, Teacher, all these things have I observed from my youth.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, chuong thu po po chu naupang chîte ka ni laia inthawkin ka zâwm hlak,” a ta."
"And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.","Chun, Isûn ama chu a en a, a hmangai tah a, a kuomah, “Kawng khat i la bâk, fe la, i nei taphawt zawr la, pasiehai kuomah pe rawh, chuongchun, vânah ro nei i tih; chun, hung la mi hung zui rawh,” a ta."
"But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thu lei chun a hmêl chu a hung inthim khup el a, lungzîngtakin a fe hmang tah a, sum tamtak nei mi a ni sih a."
"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","Chun, Isûn a en vêl a, a închûk- tirhai kuoma chun, “Sumhauhai chu Pathien rama lût a vân tak âwm deh e,” a ta."
"And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!","Chun, inchûktirhai chun, a thu hril chu mak an ti hle a, Isu ruok chun a dawn nâwk a, an kuomah, “Nauhai, sum ringhai ta ding chun Pathien rama lût a vân tak hlak deh aw;"
"It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","Mihausa Pathien rama a lût nêkin sanghâwngsei ṭhim naa a lût thleng awl lem a tih,” a ta."
"And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?","Chun, anni chun mak an ti nasa bêk bêk a, a kuomah, “Anleh, tu am sandam ni thei an ti leh?” an ta."
"Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.","Isûn anni chu a en a, “Chu chu mihriem ta dingin thaw ruol a ni nawh a, Pathien ta ding ruok chun thaw ruol lo a ni nawh; Pathien ta dingin iengkim thaw thei a ni sih a,” a ta."
"Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.","Peterin a kuomah, “Ngai ta, keinîn iengkim mâksanin kan zui cheh a,” tiin a hang hril phut a."
"Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,","Isu chun, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu, tûkhawm keia lei le Chanchin Ṭha leia in amanih, unaupahai amanih, farnuhai amanih, nu ama- nih, pa amanih, nauhai amanih, ram dâm khawm amanih fe san taphawt chu,"
"but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.","hi dam sûng ngei khawm hin, inhai, unaupahai, farnuhai, nuhai, nauhai, ramhai dâm a lêt zain, suknawmnatnahai leh, hmu naw ding tukhawm an um nawh, hun la hung tlung dinga chatuona hringna leh."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.,"Nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak a hmasataka umhai chu a nuhnung- takah la um an ta, a nuhnungtakhai khawm chu a hmasatakah la um an tih,” a ta."
"And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,","Chun, Jerusalema hang fe dingin lampuiah an um a; Isu chu a hmasah a. Anni chun mak an ti hleh a, a hung zuituhai chun an ṭih a. Chun, ama chun sâwm le pahnihai chu a tumin a ṭhuoi nâwk a,"
"saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:","“Ngai ta u, Jerusalemah ei hang fe nâwk ding a ni hi; Mihriem Naupa hi thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûk- tirtuhai kuoma inmantirin a la um ding a nih. Anni chun thi dingin a chungah thu rêlthlûng an ta, Jentailhai kuomah pêng an tih."
"and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.","Chun, nuizat siemnân hmang an ta, chil sâk khum an ta, vuong an ta, sukhlum an tih; chun, ni thum chenah thonâwk a tih,” tiin a chunga thil hung tlung dinghai chu an kuomah a hril tah a."
"And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.","Chun, Zebedai naupahai Jakob le Johan chun ama chu an hung hnai a, a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i kuomah kan hni dinghai hi i mi thawpêk kan nuom,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In ta dingin ieng am thawpêk inla cheu in nuom a?” a ta."
"And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy glory.","Anni chun a kuomah, “I ropuinaa chun i changtieng pakhat, i vawitieng pakhat mîn ṭhungtir rawh aw?” an ta."
"But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?","Isu ruok chun an kuomah, “In hni chu in hriet naw a nih. Ka no dâwn ding chu in dâwn thei am a nih? Ka baptisma chang ding khawm chu in chang thei am a nih?” a ta."
"And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Thei e,” an tih a. Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Ka no dâwn ding chu dâwn in ta, ka baptisma chang ding khawm chu chang vêng in tih;"
but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka chang- tienga manih ka vawitienga manih, ṭhung ding thu chu keia pêk ding a ni nawh a, an ibuotsaipêkhai ta ding ni lem a tih,” a ta."
"And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.","Chun, sâwmhai chun chu chu an lo hrietin Jakob le Johan chunga chun an lungninaw ta bêk bêk a."
"And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.","Isu ruok chun annihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Jentailhai chunga rorêltua an iruothai chu an chungah an inlal bêk bêk hlak a, an mi lienhai chun an chungah thu an nei nasa hle ti in hriet a."
"But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;","Nangni lai ruok chun chuong chu ni naw nih, tukhawm in laia mi lien ni nuom phawt chu in rawngbâwltuin a um lem ding a nih!"
"and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.",Tukhawm nangni laia a hmasatak ni nuom phawt chu mi po po rawng bâwltuin a um bawk ding a nih.
"For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.","Mihriem Naupa meu khawm rawngbâwlpêka um dinga hung a ni nawh a, mi tamtak intlanna dinga a hringna pe ding lema hung a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timæus, Bartimæus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.","Chun, Jeriko an hung tlung a; chun, Isu Jerikoa inthawk chun a închûktirhai leh, mipui nasatak leh a suok laiin kutdaw mitdel, Timai naupa Bartimai chu lampui sîrah a lo ṭhung a."
"And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Chuongchun, Nazareth Isu a nih ti a hriet phingin, “Isu David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk tah a."
"And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Mi tamtakin to dingin an hal a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk zuol det a."
"And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.","Isu chu a lo ngîr a, “Ama chu hung ko ta u,” a ta. Chun, mitdel chu an ko a, a kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin um rawh, a ko che,” an ta."
"And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.","Chun, ama chun a puon a pei a, ân châwm tho a, Isu kuomah a feh a."
"And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.","Chun, Isûn ama chu a lo biek a, “I chungah ieng ang am ka thaw i nuom a?” a ta. Chun, mitdel chun a kuomah, “Rabboni, hmu thei ka nuom,” a ta."
"And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.","Chun, Isûn, “Fe ta rawh, i ring- na hi i dampui a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, a hmu thei nghâl tah a, lampuia chun Isu a zui tah a."
"And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,","Chun, Jerusalem an tlung tâwm a, Oliv tlânga Bethphage le Bethani khuo kâwl an tlungin, a închûktirhai laia mi pahni a tir a,"
"and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.","an kuomah, “In hma zâwn khuoa sawn fe unla; chun, in hei lût hlimin sabengtungte thlung, tukhawm la chuongna ngainaw va hmûng in ta; chu chu sût unla hung kei ro."
"And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.","Chun, tûkhawmin, ‘A kha ieng- ding am in tih a?’ an ti cheu chun, ‘Lalpain a mamaw a nih, ahin hung insietir nâwk vak a tih,’ ti ro,” a ta."
"And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.","Chuongchun, an fe tah a, kawt- thlêra kawtkhâr puotienga sabeng- tungte inthlung an va hmuh a. Chun, chu chu an sût tah a."
"And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?","Chun, chutaka ngîr tuhai amani chun an kuomah, “Sabengtungte kha iengdinga in sût?” an ta."
And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.,"Chun, anni chun, Isu hril ang tak khan an kuoma chun an hril a; chuongchun, an fe an phal tah a."
"And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.","Chun, sabengtungte chu Isu kuomah an hung kei a, a chunga chun puonhai an phah a; chuongchun, a chungah a chuong tah a."
"And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.","Chun, mi tamtakin lampuia chun an puon an phah a; mi dangin loa sâwlhna an va sât a, an pha bawk a."
"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:","Chun, a hma tienga fehai le a hnunga hung zuituhai chun, “Hosanna, Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se;"
"Blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.","Ram hung tlung ding ei Pa David ram chu, inpâkin um raw se; A chunghnungtaka khin Hosanna,” tiin an khêk a."
"And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien biekina chun a va lût a; iengkim a en vêl zo chun; zântieng khawm a lo ni tah a, a suok a, sâwm le pahnihai leh Bethaniah an fe tah a."
"And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.","Chun, azîng Bethania inthawka a suok hnungin a phîng a ṭâm tah a."
"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.","Chun, theichang kûng hna nei hlataka hin a hei hmuh a, “A ra ka hmu duoiin,” tiin a va feh a; a va tlung chun a hna chau naw chu iengkhawm a hmu nawh a; theichang ra pha a ni naw hrim a."

"And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;","Chun, Jerusalem chu a tlung a, Pathien biekinah a va lût a, biekina iengkhat zawrtuhai le ân chawtuhai chu a hnawt suok tah a.

and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.,"Chun, Pathien biekina chun tukhawmin thuomhnaw an chawi thleng chu a phal ta bawk nawh a."
"And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “ ‘Ka in chu hnam tin ta dinga ṭawngṭaina in tîng an tih,’ ti ziek a ni naw am a nih?

"And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Dân in- chûktirtuhai chun chu chu an hriet a, a sukbo theina ding zie an zawng a.

And every evening he went forth out of the city.,"Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, Isu le a inchûktirhai chu khawpuia inthawk chun an fe suok a."
"And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.","Chun, zîngkâra an fe malam chun theichang kûng chu a zung chena thêm zo vawngin an hmu tah a."
"And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.","Chuongchun, Peterin a hriet suok nâwk a, a kuomah, “Rabbi en ta, theichang kûng ṭawngsie în phur kha a lo thêm vawng tah,” a ta."

"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?","Chun, an inngaituoh a, “ ‘Vâna mi thu,’ ei ti chun, ‘Ieng dinga a thu in awi naw?’ a mi ti âwm sih a."
"But should we say, From men—they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.","‘Mihriem thu,’ ei ti el ding am a ni chu?” an ta. Nisienlakhawm, mipui chu an ṭih a, mi po poin Johan chu zâwlnei takin an ngai tâwl sih a."

"And he began to speak unto them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.","Chun, tekhithuin an kuomah a hril tah a, “Tuin amanih grêp huon a siem a, palin ân huon a, grêp sâwrna ding khur a cho a, in insâng a bâwl a, lo enkawltuhai kuomah thlo hlaw dingin a pêk a, ram dangah a fe tah a."
"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.","Chun, a lo pha chun huona ra chu a chanâi lo enkawltuhai kuoma va la dingin lo enkawltuhai kuoma chun suok pakhat a tir a."
"And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.","Chun, chu mipa chu an lo man a, an vuok a, kut ruokin an infetir tah a."
"And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully.","Chun, suok dang an kuoma chun a tir nâwk a; chu khawm chu a lu an lo sukpawp a, inzakumtakin an lo sawisah a."
"And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some.","Chun, suok dang a tir nâwk pei a, chu mipa chu an lo sukhlum a. Suok dang tamtak khawm aṭhen an lo vuok a, aṭhen an lo sukhlum a."
"He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.","Chun, pakhat, naupa dittak chu a la nei a, ‘Ka naupa hi chu inza êm naw ni hai am,’ tiin ama chu a nuhnungtakah an kuomah a tir a."
"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong lo en- kawltuhai chun, ‘Hi mipa hi rohluotu ding chu a nih; that ei tiu khai; chuongchun, a ro hluo dinghai hi ei ta a ni el ding a nih,’ an in tih a."
"And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.","Chuongchun, ama chu an lo man a, an sukhlum a, grêp huona inthawk chun an the suok tah a."
"What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.","Chuongchun, huon neitu chun iengtin am hung thâwng a ta? Lo enkawltuhai chu hung sukbo a ta, huon chu mi danghai pêng a tih."

"And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.","Chun, ama chu man an tum tah a, nisienlakhawm, mipui an ṭi sih a, chu tekhithu chu anni demin a hril a nih ti an hriet sih a.

"And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk.","Chun, a thu hrila inthawka man dingin Pharisaihai le Herod pâwla tuhai amanih a kuomah an tir a."
"And when they were come, they say unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?","Chun, anni chu an hung tlung chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, mi indiktak i na, tukhawm pawisak chuong i nei nawh ti kan hriet a, tukhawm thlier bîk nei loin, theipatâwpin Pathien thu în chûktir hlak a.

"And Jesus said unto them, Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled greatly at him.","Chuongchun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kaisar thilhai chu Kaisar kuomah pe unla, Pathien thilhai chu Pathien kuomah pe ta unla,” a ta. Chuong- chun, mak an ti bêk bêk a."
"And there come unto him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,","Chun, Saddukaihai, thonâwkna a um nawh tituhai chu a kuomah an hung a,"

"There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed;","Awle, Sal sari hi an um a, a upatakin nuhmei a nei a, suon- mawngin a thih a."
"and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise:","Chuongchun, a pahnina chun a nuhmei chu a hluoh a, suon mawngin a thi nâwk bawk a; pathumna khawmin chuong bawk chun."
and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.,"Chuongchun, sal sarihai chu suon hrim hrim nei loin suon mawngin an thi vawng el tah a. A nuhnungtaka chun nuhmei khawm chu a thi tah a."
In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.,"Thonâwk phaleh a tu tak nuhmei am nîng a ta? An pasari chun nuhmeiin an nei seng sih a,” tiin an indawn a."
"Jesus said unto them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?","Isûn an kuomah, “Hi lei hin a nih in ngai suol rawp hlak, Pathien Lekha Thu le Pathien thil thaw theizie in hriet naw leiin."
"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.","Mithi laia an tho nâwk hnungin nuhmei pasal innei ta naw nihai a, vâna vântirkohai ang an ni lem ta ding a nih."
"But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have ye not read in the book of Moses, in the place concerning the Bush, how God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?","Chun, mithihai keithoa an um ding thu chu, Mosie lekhabua chîmbuk thua khan Pathienin ‘Kei Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien ka nih,’ tia a biekzie kha in tiem naw am a nih?"

"And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai laia mi pakhat a hung a, an insêl chu a lo ngai zing a, Isûn annirawi chu ṭhatakin a dawn ti a hriet a, a kuomah, “Thupêk po po lai ieng him a ropui tak a?” tîn ân dawn a."
"Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:","Isun “A ropui tak chu hi hi a nih, ‘Israelhai, ngai ta u, Lalpa ei Pathien chu Lalpa pakhat chau a nih,"
"and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.","Lalpa i Pathien chu i lungvar po poin, i thlarau po poin, i lungril po poin, i hrâtna po poin i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi."
"The second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.","A dawttu chu hi hi a nih, ‘Nang le nang în hmangai angin i vênghai khawm i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi. Hieng nêka thupêk ropui lem hrim hrim hi a um nawh,” tiin a dawn a."
"And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he:","Chun, Dân inchûktirtu chun a kuomah, “A ni luo ie, inchûktirtu, Ama chu pakhat chau a na, ama naw chu tukhawm dang an um nawh,"
"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.","ama chu lungril po poa, hrietna po poa, hrâtna po poa hmangai a, mâni inhmangai anga vênghai hmangai chu pumrawhmang ser pêk po po le inthawina po po nêkin a ṭha lem bêk bêk ti hi i hril dik ngawt el,” a ta."
"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.","Chun, vartakin a dawn ti Isûn a hrietin a kuomah, “Pathien ram i hlat naw hi” a ta.

"they that devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.","Hmeithai sum an fâk a, vân- tlâng hlêmna dingin sâwt tak tak an ṭawngṭai hlak a, chuonghai chun thiemnaw chang nasa zuol an tih,” a ta."
"And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.","Chun, thawlâwm bâwm zâwna chun a ṭhung a, thawlâwm bâwma mipuihai tangka thlâkzie chu a en a, mihausa tamtakin tamtak an thlâk a."
"And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.","Chun, hmeithai pasetak a hung a, dâr tangka dere pahni a thlâk a, (chu chu pawisa khat hu a nih.)"
"And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury:","Isu chun a închûktirhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, thawlâwm bâwma thlâktu po po hai nêkin hi hmeithai pasetak hin a thlâk tam lem."

"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.","Fimkhur unla, inring zinga umin ṭawngṭai ro, a hun chu in hriet si nawh a."
"It is as when a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch.","Mîn a in mâksana, a suokhai chu thu inneitira, an sin thaw ding pe seng a, kawtkhâr vêngtu khawm chu inring zinga um ding thu a pêk zet a, ram hlataka inzin ta dai ang a nih."
"Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning;","Chuongchun, inring zingin um ro, in neitupa hung ding phâ chu zântienga manih, zâna manih, ârkhuona manih, zîngkara mani ding in hriet si nawh a;"
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.,"chuong naw chun hung phut a ta, inin hung hmu hlau rawi a ti cheu."
"And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.","Chun, in kuoma ka hril hi mi po po kuoma hril ka nih, inring zingin um ro,” a ti tah a."
"Now after two days was the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him:","Chun, ni hni hnung chun Fekân Ruoiṭhe le Chawl- ṭhanglo bei Ruoiṭhe a um ding a na; Thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûk- tirtuhai chun ama chu zâwra, mana sukhlum theina dingzie an zawng an zawng a."
"for they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people.","Nisienlakhawm, “Ruoiṭhe sûng chu ni naw sienla, chuong naw chun vântlâng lai buoina hung um hlau rawi a tih,” an ta."
"And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head.","Chun, Bethania phâr Simon ina bu a fâk a, a um laiin nuhmei pakhat alabastar bûra spiknard hriek riminhnik totak chawiin a hung a, a bûr chu a sukkawi a, a lu a buok khum a."
"But there were some that had indignation among themselves, saying, To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made?","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen chu an lung a sen tâwla, “Iengdinga hriek rim inhnik hi a sukhmangthai mei mei am a na?"
"For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.","Hi hriek hi duli zathum nêka tama zawr a, pasiehai kuoma pêk thei a ni sih a,” an ta. Chuongchun, a chunga chun an chier tah a."
"But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.","Isu ruok chun, an kuomah, “To san ro, iengdinga ama in sukbuoi am a na? ka chunga hin thil mawi tak a thaw a nih."
"For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always.","Pasiehai chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um an na, in nuom phâ phâ anni chu in lunginsiet thei annâwm, kei ruok chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um ding ka ni nawh hi."
She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying.,A thaw thei ang tâwk a thaw a nih; ka taksa hi phûm dingin a lo nâl lâwk a ni hi.
"And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","Chuongchun, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, khawvêl po poah, khâwlai khawm Chanchin Ṭha an hrilna taphawta chun hi nuhmei thil thaw hi ama hriet zingna dingin hril sa pei an tih,” a ta."
"And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them.","Chun, Juda Iskariot, sâwm le pahni laia mi pakhat khan, Isu chu an kuoma ân mantir theina dingin thiempu lalhai kuomah a va feh a."
"And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him unto them.","Chun, anni chun an hriet phingleh an lâwm hle a, a kuoma tangka pêk an tiem a, chuongchun, a înmantir dingzie remchâng a zawng tah a."
"And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover?","Chun, Chawlṭhanglo bei Ruoi- ṭhe ni hmasatak Fekan Ruoiṭhena berâmte an thatna hlak nia chun a închûktirhaiin a kuomah, “Fekân Ruoi bu i fâk theina dingin khâwlai am va siem inlang i nuom a?” an ta."
"And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him;","Chuongchun, a închûktirhai laia mi pahni a tir a, an kuomah, “Khawpuiah va lût unla, pasal bêla tui putin intuokpui a ti cheu a, ama chu zui lût ro."
"and wheresoever he shall enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?","Chun, a lûtna naa chun, chu in neitupa kuoma chun, ‘Inchûktirtu chun, ka închûktirhai le Fekân Ruoi bu kan fâkna ding ka mikhuol pindan chu khâwlai am a na? a tih’ ti unla."
And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready: and there make ready for us.,"Chuongchun, ama ngei chun pindan chunghnung lientak, thuom- hnaw umsa, inrêlsa diem, inentir a ti cheu a, chu hmuna chun ei ta dingin va siem ro,” a ta."
"And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.","Chun, inchûktirhai chu an feh a, khawpuia chun an va lût a; an kuoma a hril ang khan an va hmuh a, chun, Fekân Ruoi bu chu an siem tah a."
And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve.,"Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, ama chu sâwm le pahnihai le chun an va fe tah a."
"And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with me.","Chun, an awt a, an fâk laiin Isûn, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, nangni laia mi pakhat ka kuoma fa ve ngei hin mîn mantir a tih,” a ta."
"They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I?","Chun, an lungngai ta hle a, pakhat khatin a kuomah, “Kei am ka nih?” an ti seng a."
"And he said unto them, It is one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Sâwm le pahni laia mi pakhat thlênga a mîn chiepuitu hi a nih."
"For the Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.","Mihriem Naupa hi a chanchin an ziek ang tak khan a fe ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, Mihriem Naupa inmantirtu ding mihriem chung chu a rik; chu mipa chu lo insieng naw sienla a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih,” a ta."
"And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body.","Chun, an fâk laiin Isûn bei a lâk a, mal a sâwm zoin a khawi a, an kuomah a pêk a, “La ro, hi hi ka taksa a nih,” a ta."
"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it.","Chun, no a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin anni a pêk a, chuongchun, an rêngin an dâwn ta seng a."
"And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.","Chun, ama chun, an kuomah, “Hi hi ka thisen, mi tamtak ta dinga suok ding thu thlungna chu a nih."
"Verily I say unto you, I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Pathien rama a thar ka dâwn ni a tlung hmâkhat chu, grêp hrui raa hi dâwn nâwk ta naw ning,” a ta."
"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.","Chuongchun, hla an sak zo chun an fe suok a, Oliv tlânga chun an fe tah a."
"And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “In rêngin lungniloin la um vawng in tih, ‘Berâmpu vuong ka ta, berâmhai chu indar an tih,’ ti ziek a ni sih a."
"Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thonâwk hnungin Galili ramah in hmaah fêng ka tih,” a ta."
"But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.","Peter ruok chun a kuomah, “An rêngin lungniloin um hai sienla khawm, kei chu um naw ning,” a ta."
"And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that thou to-day, even this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a kuom- ah, “Titakzetin ka hril che, vawisûn, vawizân le le hin âr vawi hni a khuong hmâin nangin vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a ta."
"But he spake exceeding vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.","Ama ruok chun nasatakin, “I thinaa chun thi ve ding ni lang khawm, inphat naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuongchun, ama ang chun an ti ta seng a."
"And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.","Chun, Gethsemane an ti hmun chu an tlung a; chuongchun, ama chun a închûktirhai kuomah, “Ka ṭawngṭai sûng po hitaka hin lo ṭhung ro,” a ta."
"And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled.","Chun, Peter hai, Jakob hai, Johan hai chu a ṭhuoi a; nasatakin a thlaphângin a lunginzing ta bêk bêk a."
"And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch.","Chuongchun, an kuomah, “Ka lungril a lungngai bêk bêk a, thipui khawp rau a nih, hitaka hin um unla inring zing ro,” a ta."
"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.","Chun, hmatieng chun a va fe hlek a, hnuoia chun a bawkkhup a, thaw thei ni sien chu chu hun chun ama khêl dingin a ṭawngṭai a."
"And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt.","“Abba, (Pa,) tinrêng i thaw thei a, hi no hi ka kuoma inthawkin la sawn rawh; nisienlakhawm, keia thu ni loin, nangma thu thu ni lem raw se,” a ta."
"And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour?","Chun, a hung a, annirawi chu inin a hung hmuh a; chuongchun, Peter kuomah, “Simon, i in a ni maw? Dâr kâr khat khawm inring zingin i um thei naw maw?"
"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.","Thlêmnaa in lût nawna dingin inring zingin ṭawngṭai ro. Thlarau chun chu a pei a, tisa ruok chu a hrât naw a nih,” a ta."
"And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.","Chun, a va fe nâwk a, a thu hril ngai bawk chu hrilin a ṭawngṭai nâwk a."
"And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.","Chun, a hung kîr nâwk chun annirawi chu inin a hung hmu nâwk a, an îmu a suok hle sih a, ama dawn ngaina an hriet nawh a."
"And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Chun, a hung a, a vawi thumnaa chun an kuomah, “Tuhin chu in unla châwl ta ro, a hun tâwk tah! a hun chu a tlung a ni ta hi! Ngai ta u, Mihriem Naupa hi mi suolhai kutah an inmantir ding a ni hi."
"Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.","Tho unla fêng ei tiu, en ta u, a mîn mantirtu ding chu a hung hnai ta hi,” a ta."
"And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.","Chun, a la hril lai zingin, Juda, sâwm le pahnihai laia mi pakhat chu a hung tlung nghâl el tah a, ama ruol chun thiempu lalhai le Dân in- chûktirtuhai le upahai kuoma inthawk, mipui chu, kâwlhnâm le hembâwk dâm chawiin an hung tlung bawk a."
"Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.","Chun, a înmantirtu ding chun, “Ka ifâwp chu ama nîng a ta, man unla feltakin ṭhuoi hmang el ro,” tîn a hmân inchikna dâm a lo hril vawng ta sa a na."
"And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him.","Chuongchun, a tlung phingleh ama a va pan nghâl tah a, “Rabbi,” tiin a fâwp ngâwi ngâwi a."
"And they laid hands on him, and took him.","Chun, ama chu an chel a, an man tah a."
"But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.","Chun, a kuoma ngirhai laia tuin amanih a kâwlhnâm a phawi a. Thiempu Laltak suokpa chu a sât a, a nakâwr a sât thlâkpêk a."
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?","Chun, Isûn anni chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Kâwlhnâmhai, hembâwk- hai chawiin suomhmang man ding ang elin, mi man dingin in hung a ni maw?"
"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled.","Pathien biekinah ni tin inchûktirin ka um hlak a, in mi man si nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Lekha Thu chu a hung tlung theina ding a ni hi,” a ta."
"And they all left him, and fled.","Chun, an rêngin ama chu an zâmsan a, an tlân hmang vawng tah a."
"And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him;","Chun, tlangvâl tu amanih puon zai inhmi chaua inbelin, ama chu a zui a; chuongchun, ama chu an lo man a."
"but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.","Nisienlakhawm, a puon zai inhmi chu a mâksan a, ruokin a tlân hmang tah a."
And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.,"Chun, Isu chu Thiempu Laltak kuomah an ṭhuoi a; ama ruol chun thiempu lalhai, upahai, Dân in- chûktirtuhai po po an hung khâwm a."
"And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.","Chun, Peterin hlataka hin ama chu, Thiempu Laltak in in huonna sûng tuol chen chun a zui a; chuongchun, manmihai lai chun mei lum awiin a ṭhung veh a."
Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not.,"Chuongchun, Isu chu an sukhlum theina dingin thiempu lalhai le rorêltuhai po po chun ama hêkna an zawng a; an hmu si nawh a."
"For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together.","Mi tamtakin khêlin an hêk a; nisienlakhawm, an hêkna thuhai chu ân hmu thei si nawh a."
"And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,","Chun, tuhai amanih an ngîr a, khêlin an hêk a,"
"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.","“Hi mipa hin, ‘Hi Pathien biekin kuta bâwl hi ṭhiek ka ta, ni thum kâr chauin biekin dang, kuta bâwl naw mi bâwl ka tih,’ a ti kan hriet,” an ta."
And not even so did their witness agree together.,Chuong khawm chun an hêkna thu ân hmu thei chuong nawh a.
"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chu a ngîr suok a, Isu kuomah, “Ieng- khawmin i dawn naw maw? Hienghaiin an hêkna che hi ieng tizie am a na?” tiin ân dawn a."
"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?","Ama ruok chu a to zing a, iengkhawmin a dawn nawh a. Thiempu Laltak chun a kuomah, “Krista, Inpâk tlâk Naupa chu i ni maw?” tiin ân dawn a."
"And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.","Chun, Isûn, “Ni e, Mihriem Naupa hi thilthawtheina chang tienga ṭhunga, vân sûm laia hung la hmûng in tih,” a ta."
"And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses?","Chun, Thiempu laltak chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, “Hretu dang ieng dingin am ngai tâng ei ta?"
Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.,"Pathien a hrilsietzie hlak chu in hriet tah a; iengtin am in ngai?” a ta. Chun, an rêngin ama chu thi tlâkah an ruot tâwl tah a."
"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.","Chuongchun, aṭhen lem chun chil an sâk khum phut nghâl el tah a, a hmai an tuom a, an vuok a, a kuomah, “Hril rawh!” an tih a. Chun, manmihai khawm chun chel pumin an ben sawk sawk a."
"And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest;","Chun, Peter chu hnuoi tienga in inhuonna sûng tuollaia a um laiin, Thiempu Laltak rawngbâwltu nu- nghâkhai laia pakhat a hung a."
"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, even Jesus.","Peter mei lum awi chu a hmuh a, a en zing a, “Nang khawm hi Isu Nazareth mi kuoma um kha i ni hi,” a ta."
"But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.","Ama ruok chun, “I thu hril chu ka hriet naw tawp el, a ngaina hrim hrim khawm ka hriet naw tawp el,” tîn ân phah a. Chun, tuolkawt bula chun a va suok a, chuongchun, âr a khuong tah a."
"And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.","Chun, nunghâk chun a hmuh a, a kâwla ngîrhai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa hi anni laia mi a nih,” a ti nâwk a. Nisienlakhawm, ân pha nâwk a."
"But he again denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, Of a truth thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilæan.","Chun, a nakie deu chun a kâwla ngîrhai chun Peter kuomah, “Anni laia mi i ni ngei hi maw, Galili rama mi i ni sih a,” an tih a."
"But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.","Ama ruok chun, “Chu mihriem in hril chu ka hriet naw tawp,” tiin ṭawngsie inphurin ân khâm a."
"And straightway the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.","Chun, âr khuong vawi hnina chu a khuong nghâl tah a; chun, Peter chun Isûn a kuoma, “Âr vawi hni a khuong hmain nangin vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a ti thu kha a hung hriet suok tah a. Chuongchun, chu thu chu a ngaituoin a ṭap tah a."
"And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.","Chun, zîngkâr a hung ni phingleh thiempuhai chu upa- hai le Dân inchûktirtuhai le rorêltuhai po po leh an inrâwn a, Isu chu an phier a, an ṭhuoi a, Pilat kuomah an pêk nghâl tah a."
"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.","Chun, Pilat chun a kuomah, “Judahai lal i ni am a nih?” tiin ân dawn a; ama chun, “I hril ang chun ka nih,” tiin a dawn a."
And the chief priests accused him of many things.,"Chun, thiempuhai chun kawng tamtakin an hêk a."
"And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.","Chuongchun, Pilatin ân dawn nâwk a, a kuomah, “Iengkhawmin i dawn naw maw? Ngai ta, an hêkna zozai che hi,” a ta."
But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.,"Isu ruok chun iengkhawmin a dawn ta nawh a: chuleichun, Pilat chun mak a ti hle a."
"Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.","Chun, Pilatin Ruoiṭhe ni chun mi intâng pakhat an ngên taphawt chu ân suopêk hlak a."
"And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.","Chun, mi pakhat Barabba an ti chu, helhai laia phiera intâng ve zing a na, chuonghai chun an helnaa chun tuol an that a nih."
And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them.,"Chun, mipuihai chu an hang feh a, an ta dinga a thawpêk hlak anga thaw dingin an ngên tah a."
"And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?","Chuongchun, Pilatin an kuomah, “Judahai lal hi insuopêk lang cheu in nuom am?” a ta."
For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.,(Thiempu lalhaiin an îtsîk leiin an hung ṭhuoi a ni ti a hriet sih a).
"But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.","Nisienlakhawm, Thiempu lal- hai chun mipuihai chu Barabba chu insuopêk lem dinga hni dingin an infui a."
"And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?","Chun, Pilat chun an kuomah, “Anleh Judahai lal in ti hi iengtin am thaw tâng ka ta?” tiin a dawn nâwk a."
"And they cried out again, Crucify him.","Anni chun, “Krawsah hemde rawh,” tiin an khêk nâwk a."
"And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.","Pilat chun an kuomah, “Iengdingin am ie? Ieng am a suksuol leh?” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, anni chu, “Krawsah hemde rawh,” tiin an khêk zuol sau a!"
"And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.","Chuongchun, Pilatin mipuihai suklungawi a nuom a, Barabba chu ân suopêk tah a. Chun, Isu chu a vuok zoin krawsa hemde dingin a pêk tah a."
"And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.","Chun, sipaihai chun in inhuonna sûng tuollai Praitorion an tia chun ama chu an ṭhuoi lût a, an pâwla mi po po an ko khâwm a."
"And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;","Chuongchun, puon sen duk an insiltir a, hlingin lukhum an phier a, an inkhumtir a."
"and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!","Chuongchun, “Chibai, Judahai Lal,” tiin chibai an bûk a."
"And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.","Chun, a lua chun luongin an vuok a, chil an sâk khum a, dingṭhaṭhuonin chibai an bûk a."
"And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.","Chun, nuiza siemnaa an hmang zo chun, puon sen duk chu an hlîp a, ama puon an insiltir nâwk a. Krawsah hemde dingin an ṭhuoi suok tah a."
"And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.","Chun, mi invâk mei mei pakhat, rama inthawka hung, Simon Kurinia um, Alexander le Rufa pa chu a kraws puttu dingin an man a."
"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.","Chun, Isu chu Golgotha hmunah an ṭhuoi a, (chu chu “Luru hmun” tina a nih)."
And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.,"Chun, uoin murra le pawl an pêk a,nisienlakhawm, a lâk nuom nawh a."
"And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.","Chun, krawsah an hemdeh a, an chang ding hrietna dingin, aisânin a silfênhai chu an insem a."
"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.","Chun, Isu an hemde hun chu vairik lai a nih."
"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Chun, a hêkna lekha a chungah an ziek a, “JUDAHAI LAL,” tiin."
"And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.","Chun, ama ruol chun suom- hmang pahni an hemde veh a, a chang- tieng pakhat, a vawitieng pakhat."
,"[Pathien Lekhathu, “Bawsetu- hai leh tiemsain a um tah” ti kha a hung tlung tah a.]"
"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,","Chun, mi fe vêl po chun an lu thinin, “A hei! nang Pathien biekin ṭhiek a, ni thum kâra bâwl nâwktu,"
"save thyself, and come down from the cross.","insukdam la kraws lêra kha hung ṭum ta la,” tiin an ti el a."
"In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.","Chuong ang bawkin thiempu lalhai chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai leh, anni lai chun ti elin, “Mi dang hman a sukdam hlak a, ama ân sukdam thei si nawh a."
"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.","Ei hmuh a, ei awi theina dingin Krista, Israelhai lal chu, tuhin kraws lêra inthawkin hung ṭum ta sienla,” an ta. Chun, ama ruola an hemde vehai khawm chun ama chu an hal a."
"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.","Chun, nisa inding huna chun, zânbu suong pha chenin khawvêl a hung inthim ta vawng a."
"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?","Chun, zânbu suong phâ chun Isu chu râwl inringtakin, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabakthani?” tiin a khêk suok a. (Chu chu “Ka Pathien, ka Pathien, iengdinga i mi mâksan?” tina a nih)."
"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.","Chun, a kuoma ngîr ṭhenkhat chun chu chu an hrietin, “Ngai ta u, Elija a ko a nih,” an ta."
"And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.","Chun, mi pakhat a tlân a, sponj uoin thûra inchie sipin, hmawl lêrah a târ a, a hang indâwntir a. “Hun raw se, ama la thla dingin Elija a hung am en ei tiu,” an ta."
"And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.","Chun, Isu chu râwl inringtakin a khêk a, a thlarau ân thla tah a."
And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.,"Chun, Pathien biekina puonzâr chu a chungtienga inthawkin a mawng tlung rakin a lo inthlêr suo tah a."
"And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.","Chun, a hmaa sipai za hotu ngîr chun, a thlarau chuonga ân thla a hmu chun, “Hi mipa hi Pathien Naupa a ni ngei el,” a ta."
"And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;","Chun, nuhmeihai khawm hlataka thlîrin an um a; chuhai lai chun, Mari Magdalin hai, Mari, Jakob chîn le Jose nu hai dâm, le Salomi hai an ṭhang a, (chuonghai chu Galili rama a um laia ama zuia a rawng bâwlpêk hlak hai chu an nih);"
"who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.",nuhmei dang tamtak Jeru- salema ama ruola hang fe vehai chu an ṭhang bawk a.
"And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,","Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun Inringlâwk ni a ni leiin (chu chu Châwlni hmaa ni hi a nih),"
"there came Joseph of Arimathæa, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.","Josef Arimathaia mi, rorêltu inzaum, Pathien ram beisei ve mi bawk, a hung a, huoitakin Pilat kuomah a lût a, Isu ruong chu a hni tah a."
"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.","Chuongchun, Pilatin a thi vak chu mak a ti hle a; sipai za hotu chu a ko a, a thina a sâwt ta amanih ti ân dawn a."
"And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.","Chun, sipai za hotu baua thu a hriet phing chun a ruong chu Josef kuomah a pêk a."
"And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.","Chun, ama chun puon innêm ân châwk a, ama chu a lâk thlâk a, puon innêm chun a tuom a, thlân, lung inkerkuoah ân zâl a, thlân kawtkhâr chu lungin ân del a."
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.,"Chun, Mari Magdalin le Josef nu Mari chun an inzâlna chu an hmu zing a."
"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.","Chun, Châwlni a hung bo chun Mari Magdalin hai, Mari Jakob nu hai, Salomi hai chun ama nâl dinga an va fe theina ding chun thil riminhnik an inchâwk a."
"And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.","Chuongchun, ni saria ni hma- sataka, zîngkâr nisa suok hnungin, thlân chu an va tlung a."
"And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?","Chun, “Thlân kawta lung chu tuin am mîn hlum hmangpêk a ta?” an inti lai zingin,"
"and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.","an hang nghah a, lung chu inhlum hmang sain an hang hmu tah a, a lien hle sih a."
"And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.","Chun, thlân sûngah an lût a, tlangvâl pakhat puon vâr silin changtieng panga ṭhung an hmuh a; an lunginzîng tah a."
"And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah, “Lunginzing naw ro, Isu Nazareth mi, an hemde kha in zawng a ni âwm a, a thonâwk tah a, hi hin a um ta nawh; en ta u, an inzâlna hi."
"But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.","Nisienlakhawm, fe unla a închûktirhai le Peter kuoma chun, ‘Galili ramah in hmaa a fe ding a na; in kuoma a hril ang ngei khan chu chun hmûng in tih,’ tiin hril ro,” a ta."
"And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.","Chuongchun, an inthin a, an lunginzîng hle lai chun, an suok a, thlâna inthawk chun an tlân ta vang vang a, an ṭi luotin tu kuoma khawm iengkhawm an hril nawh a."
"Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.","[Chun, ni saria ni hmasatak, zîngkâra a thonâwk chun, Mari Magdalin, a sûnga inthawka khawhri pasari a hnawt suokpêk kuoma khan ân lâr hmasatak a."
"She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.","Chun, ama chu Isu umpui hlakhai kuomah a va feh a, mithi ngaia an ṭaplai chu a hril tah a."
"And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun, a hring nâwk a, hmu khawm a hmu ti chu an hriet dea chu an awi si nawh a."
"And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.","Chun, chu hnunga chun anni laia pahni ram tieng pana an fe laiin hmêl danglam putin an kuomah ân lâr nâwk a."
And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.,"Chun, anni chun inchûktir danghai kuomah an va hril a, anni thu khawm chu an awi chuong nawh a."
"And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.","Chun, chu hnung nâwka chun buthlêng an awt laiin sâwm le pakhat hai kuom ngeiah ân lâr nâwk a, a thonâwk hnunga a hmutuhai thu chu an awi naw leiin an awi nawna le an lungril ngar kawnga chun a kâwk tâwl a."
"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.","Chun, an kuomah, “Khawvêl po poah fe unla, thilsiemhai po po kuomah Chanchin Ṭha hi hril ro."
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.,"Awia, baptisma chang chu sandamin um an tih; a awi naw ruok chu thiemnaw changin um an tih."
And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;,"Chun, hieng inchiknahai hin a awituhai chu zui pei a tih: Ka hmingin khawhrihai hnawt dawk an ta, ṭawng tharhaiin ṭawng an tih."
"they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.","Rûlhai kut chungah dawm an ta, thina tûr iengang khawm dâwn hai sienla iengkhawm ti naw ni hai; damnawhai chungah an kut innghat an ta, dam pei an tih,” a ta."
"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.","Chuongchun, Lal Isu chu an kuoma thu a hril zo chun vâna zuk ṭhuoiin a um tah a, Pathien changtieng a hang ṭhung tah a."
"And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.","Chuongchun, anni chu an fe suok a, ram tinah thu an hril tah a; Lalpain anni ân thlawppui a, a zuitu inchiknahai chun an thu chu a sukdet pei a, Amen]."
"And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house.","Chun, ni ieng zât amani hnunga Kapernaum a hung lût nâwkin, inah ama a um ti thu ân thang tah a."
"And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he spake the word unto them.","Chuongchun, kawt bula khawm umna um naw khawp rakin, mi tamtak an hung khâwm a; an kuoma chun thu a hril tah a."
"And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.","Chun, mi zeng pakhat, mi palia zâwn a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
"And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.","Chun, mipui leia Isu kâwl hnai an tlung thei naw leiin, a umna in chung chu an ṭhiek tah a; chuonga an ṭhiek zo phing chun mi zeng chu a puonpha pum chun an zuk thlâk tah a."
"And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven.","Chuongchun, Isûn an ringzie chu a lo hmuh a, mi zeng kuoma chun, “Naupa, i suolhai ngaidam a ni tah,” a ta."
"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,","Chun, Dân inchûktirtu ṭhenkhat chutaka chun an ṭhung a, an lungril chun hieng hin an ngaituoh a,"
"Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, even God?","“Hi mipa hin ieng dinga hieng thu hi hril am a ni leh? Pathien a hrilsiet a ni hi. Mi pakhat, Pathien chau naw chun tuin am suolhai a ngaidam thei a?” tiin."
"And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?","Chun, chuong thu chu an ngaituo a ni ti Isûn a lungrilin a hriet nghâl tah a, an kuomah, “Chuong thu chu iengdinga in lungrila in ngaituo am a na?"
"Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?","Zeng kuoma chun, ‘I suol ngai- dam a ni tah,’ ti le, ‘I puonpha la la, kein fe ta rawh,’ ti hi a ieng am hril a awl lem a?"
"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy),","Iengkhawm ni sienla, khawvêla hin, Mihriem Naupan suol ngaidam theina a nei ti in hrietna dingin,” (Zeng kuoma chun)"
"I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.","“Tho la, i puonpha la la, i inah fe ta rawh, ka ti che,” a ta."
"And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.","Chuongchun, ama chu a tho a, a puonpha chu a lâk a, an rênga mithmu ngei chun a suok tah a; chuongchun, an rêngin mak an ti hle a, “Hieng ang hrim hrim hi ei la hmu ngai nawh,” tîn Pathien an inpâk tah a."
"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.","Chun, a suok nâwk a, dîl panga chun a fe tah a; chun mipui po po chu a kuomah an va feh a, a lo inchûktir tah a."
"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphæus sitting at the place of toll, and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.","Chun, a fe malamin, Levi, Alphai naupa chu siechawina hmuna ṭhung a hmuh a, a kuomah, “Mi hung zui rawh,” a ta. Ama chu a tho a, a zui tah a."
"And it came to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.","Chun, Isu chun Levi inah thlaithlêng a awt a; siedâwltuhai le mi suol tamtakin a închûktirhai chu an awtpui tâwl a, tamtak el an na, ama chu an zui ve bawk hlak."
"And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?","Chun, Pharisaihai laia Dân inchûktirtuhaiin Isûn mi suol le siedâwltuhai a awtpui an hmuin, a închûktirhai kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea siedâwltuhai lai a fâkin a dâwn am a na?” an ta."
"And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.","Chun, Isûn chu chu a lo hriet a, “Mi hrâthai chun dâktawr an ngai nawh a, mi hrivawisiehai lemin an ngai a nih; mi feltakhai indawn dinga hung ka ni nawh a, mi suolhai lem indawn dinga hung ka nih,” a ta."
"And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?","Chun, Pharisai le Johan in- chûktirhai chun bu an nghei a; chun, “Ieng dinga Johan inchûktirhai le Pharisai inchûktir haiin bu an nghei hlak a, i închûktirhai hlakin an nghei ve ngai naw?” an ta."
"And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.","Isûn an kuomah, “Mo ṭhuoitu- hai kuoma a pasal ding chu a um sûng po chu mo ṭhuoituhai chun bu nghei thei naw ni hai,"
"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.","nisienlakhawm, a pasal ding chu an kuoma inthawka ṭhuoi hmang ni la hung tlung a ta, chu nia ruok chun la nghei an tih."
"No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made.","Tukhawmin puon hlui puon la rin mar lo hlekin an phâwk ngai nawh; phâwk ang sienla, a phâwkna chun keiek lem a tih, a thar chun a hlui chu keiek a ta, inek nasa det lem a tih."
"And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins.","Chun, tukhawmin uoin thar savun uoin peng hluiahai an thun ngai nawh; thun ang sienla, uoin chun savun peng chu mawrdar a ta, uoin le savun peng chu bo hmang ve vêng a tih, uoin thar chu savun uoin peng tharahai an thun lem hlak a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears.","Chun, Isu chu châwlniin bu bilahai a fe thleng a, chuongchun, a închûktirhai chun an fe malamin buvûihai chu an thliek tah a."
"And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?","Chun, Pharisaihai chun a kuomah, “En ta, iengdinga châwlnia thaw thieng naw chu an thaw am a na?” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “David le a ruolhai an tlâksama, an phîng a ṭâm laia an thil thaw kha in tiem naw am a nih?"
"How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?","Khânga Abiathar Thiempu Laltak a ni laia Pathien inah a lût a, Thiempuhai chau naw chun fâk thieng lo bei chu a fâk a, a ruolhai khawm a pêk ve thu kha?” a ta."
"And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:","Chun, ama bâwkin an kuoma chun, “Châwlni hi mihriem ta dinga siem a na, mihriem hi Châwlni ta dinga siem a ni nawh;"
so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.,"chuongchun, Mihriem Naupa hi Châwlni chunga chen khawm Lal a nih,” a ta."
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.,"Chun, inkhâwmna ina chun a lût nâwk a, chutaka chun mi pakhat kutzeng hi a lo um a."
"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.","Chun, ama an hêk theina dingin Châwlnin a sukdam ding le sukdam naw ding an enthlit a."
"And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.","Ama chun kutzeng kuoma chun, “Hung ngîr dawk rawh,” a ta."
"And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “Châwlni hin sukṭhat am a thieng, suksiet? sandam am a thieng sukhlum?” tiin ân dawn a. Nisienlakhawm, an to zing a."
"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.","Chun, an lungril ngar zie chu pawitipêk bêk bêkin, lungsen puma anni a en vêl hnungin, chu mipa kuoma chun, “I kut phar rawh,” a ta.

"And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.","Chun, Pharisaihai chu an suok a, ama an sukhlum theinazie ding ngaituoin Herod pâwla mihai le chun an inrâwn nghâl tah a."
"And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judæa,","Chun, Isu chu a inchûktirhai le chun dîl tieng an fe hmang tah a, chuongchun, Galili rama inthawkin mipui nasatakin an zui tah a."
"and from Jerusalem, and from Idumæa, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.","Chun, a thil thaw ropuizie chu an hrietin, Judai rama inthawk dâmin, Jerusalema inthawk dâmin, Idumai rama inthawk dâmin, Tura le Sidon khuo vêla inthawk dâmin mipui nasatak a kuomah an hung veh a."
"And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:","Chun, mipui lei chun a ta dinga lawnglêng pakhat lo siemrêlpêk dingin a închûktirhai a hril a. “Chuong naw chun mi hneng hut hut rawi an tih,” a ta."
for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.,"Mi tamtak a sukdam nghâl tah a; chuongchun, natna nei po po chun ama an them theina dingin an bûm tul tul a."
"And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.","Khawhri inthieng nawhai khawmin ama an hmu po leh a hmaa bawkkhupin, “Nang Pathien Naupa chu i nih,” tiin an khêk hlak a."
And he charged them much that they should not make him known.,"Chun, ama chun a chanchin chu phuong lo dingin an kuomah a ti tlat pei a."
"And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.","Chun, tlânga chun a hang feh a, amain a dit pohai chu a ko a, chuongchun, anni chu a kuomah an hang feh a."
"And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,","Chun, sâwm le pahni a ruot a, a kuoma an um theina dingin le thu hril dinga a tir dawk theina ding le,"
and to have authority to cast out demons:,khawhrihai hnawt dawkna thu nei dinga a tir dawk theina dingin.

"And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.","Sûng khat khawm anni le anni an indo chun, chuhai sûng chu ngîr suok thei naw ni hai."
"And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.","Setan khawm ama le ama indo a, ân khing si chun, ngîr suok thei naw nih a, bohmang el lem a tih."
"But no one can enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.","Tukhawm mi hrât ina lûtin a sum chu a lâkpêk thei ngai nawh, mi hrât chu an phier hmasa zet naw chun; chu hnunga ruok chun a in chu inrampêk el an tih."

"And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.","Chun, a ṭhen chu hlohlingnei lai a tlah a, hlo chu a hung mâwng sâng a, a dîp hmang tah a, ra hrim hrim a ra ta nawh a."
"And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.","Chun, a ṭhen hnuoiṭhaah a tlah a, a mâwng a, ân ṭhang lien a, a ra tah a; sâwmthum dâm, sâwmruk dâm, za dâmin a pung tâwl tah a,” a ta."
"And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Tukhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.","Chun, fienriela a um laiin a kuoma sâwm le pahnihai le um mi danghai chun tekhithuhai chu an indawn fel a."
"And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Pathien ram thurûk chu nangni hai hriet chu phal a na, puotienga mihai ta ding ruok chun iengkim tekhithua hril a nih;"
"that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.","chuongchun, ‘Hmu chu an hmu thei deh a, hriet ruok chu an hriet thei nawna ding le na ruok chun an hriet thei deh a, a ngaina ruok chu an hriet thei nawna dingin, chuong naw chun ngha kîr nawk an ta, ngaidam hung ni hlau rawi an tih,’” a ta."
"And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?","Chun, ama bawkin, an kuoma chun, “Hi tekhithu hi in hriet thei naw maw? Chuongchu a ni chun iengtin am tekhithu danghai po po chu hre hrim in ta?"
The sower soweth the word.,Bu chi thetu chun thu chu a the a nih.
"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.","Chun, lampui sîra thu thênahai chu hieng hi an nih; thu an hriet phingleh Setan chun an lungrila thu thea um chu a lâkpêk nghâl hlak."
"And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;","Chun, chuong ang bawk chun pielthlêng chunga the chu hieng hi an nih: thu chu an hriet phinga lâwmtaka pawm nghâl el hlakhai hi;"
"and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.","nisienlakhawm, annia chun zung hrim an nei nawh a, sâwt nâwte chau an um a, thu leia rinumna amanih, suknawmnatna amanih a hung um phing leh an tlu nghâl el hlak a nih."
"And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,","Chun, mi danghai chu hlohling- nei laia the chu an nih, chuonghai chun thu chu an hriet tah a;"
"and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.","nisienlakhawm, khawvêl lung- khamnahai, hausakna hlêmnahai, thil dang châknahai chu a hung lût a, thu chu a dîp a, ra loin a lo um hlak."
"And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.","Chun, hnuoi ṭhaa thehai chu hieng hi an nih: thu chu hrea, pawm a, a lêt sâwmthum dâm, a lêt sâwmruk dâm, a lêt za dâma rahai hi,” a ta."
"And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, and not to be put on the stand?","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Khâwnvar chu a sienaa sie loa lei- khâwr hnuoia manih, khum hnuoia manih sie dingin an hung lâk hlak am a nih?"
"For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.","Inphuong naw dinga ip ieng- khawm a um nghâl nawh a, inlang lo dinga thuphmang iengkhawm a um bawk nawh."
"If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Tukhawmin hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
"And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuoma chun, “In thu ngai chu nguntakin ngaituo ro, in inkhîna ngai bawkin inkhi pêk an ti cheu a, pe tam lem hman hman an ti cheu."
"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.","Tukhawm a nei chu pe sâng an ta, tukhawm a nei naw chu a nei sun khawm lâkpêk an tih,” a ta."
"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;","Chun, ama bawkin, “Pathien ram chu hieng ang hi a nih; mîn hnuoia hin chi the sienla, zâna inin sûnah tho hlak sienla;"
"and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.","a umzie a hriet loin hung mâwngin hung inṭhang sienla, chuong ang chu a nih."
"The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.","Hnuoi hin amain ra a hung insuo hlak, a phut chun a kûng, chu zoa chun a ra, chun chu zo nâwka chun a vûia bu mal kim chu."
"But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.","Chun, ra chu a hung hmin pha, bu lâk a lo hun ta leiin kâwite a kei suok nghâl hlak a nih,” a ta."
"And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?","Chun, ama bawkin, “Pathien ram chu ieng lêm hrilkhîng ei tih aw? annawleh, ieng tekhithu lêm hril- khîng ei ta?"
"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,","Anṭam chi mal khat hnuoia an thein, hnuoi chunga chi po po nêkin chîntak sienla khawm;"
"yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.","the zo hnung ruok chun a hung mâwng a, thlâi po po nêkin a hung lien lem tah a, zâr lientak tak dâm a hung nei a, chuongchun, chunglêng vatehai chu a buka chun an riek thei hlak; chuong ang chu a nih,” a ta."
"And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;","Chuong ang tekhithu tamtakin, an ihriet thei tâwk tâwkin, thu chu an kuomah a hril hlak."
and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.,Tekhithu naw chun an kuomah thu a hril ngai nawh; ama inchûk- tirhai kuoma ruok chun fienrielah iengkim a hrilfie hlak a.
"And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.","Chun, chu ni ma, zântieng chun ama chun an kuomah, “Râlkhing tieng sawn kai ei tiu,” a ta."
"And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.","Chuongchun, mipui chu mâk- sanin, ama chu a um ngai chun lawnga chun an fepui nghâl tah a. Lawng dang dâm khawm a kuomah a um a."
"And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.","Chun, thlipui nasatak a hung hrâng a, tuifâwnhai dâm chu lawnga chun a hung insawk lût hlawp hlawp a; chuongchun, lawng chu a hung sip vâng vâng el tah a."
"And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?","Chun, ama chu lukham chu khamin lawng mei tieng chun a lo in a; chun, an keitho a, a kuoma chun, “Inchûktirtu, kan bohmang hi pawi i ti nâwm a nih?” an ta."
"And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.","Chun, ama chu a hung har a, thli chu a hal a, dîl kuoma khawm chun, “To la, um ṭawk ṭawk rawh,” a ta. Chun, thli chu a ma a, a hung re ta ṭhup el a."
"And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga chuong bêk bêka ṭi am in na? Ringna hrim in la nei naw a ni maw?” a ta."
"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?","Chuongchun, ṭit namênin an ṭi ta nawh a, “Hi mipa hi tu am a ni lie? thli le dîl chen khawmin a thu an awi hi,” an inti tâwl a."
"And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.","Chun, dîl râl, Gerasin mihai ram chu an hung tlung a."
"And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,","Chun, lawnga inthawka a suok chau chun mi pakhat, khawhri inthieng naw iman thlâna inthawka hung suok chun ân tuokpui tah a;"
"who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;","chu mipa chun thlâna dâm chun umna a nei hlak a, tukhawmin khaidiet khawmin an khit thei ta nawh a;"
"because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him.","kawlhai le khaidiethai khawmin an khit rawp ta hlak a, anachu khaidiethai dâm chu a keitan a, kawlhai dâm khawm chu a sukbawng pei hlak a; tukhawmin an sukdawl zo nawh a."
"And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.","A sûn a zânin thlânahai le tlângahai chun a khêk hlak a, lung dâm khawmin ân ât rawp hlak a."
"And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him;","Chun, hlataka inthawkin Isu chu a hei hmu phingleh a tlân a, chibai a va bûk a."
"and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.","Chun, râwl inringtaka khêkin, “Isu, Pathien Chunghnungtak Nau- pa, kei le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna a um a? Mi sawisa naw hrâm dingin Pathien hmingin ka ngên ṭal che a nih,” a ta."
"For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man.","(Isu chun a kuomah, “Nang khawhri inthieng naw, mihriem sûnga hi suok rawh,” a lo ti nghâl tah a.)"
"And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many.","Chun, Isu chun, “I hming ieng am a na?” tîn ân dawn a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Ka hming chu Nuoia a nih, tamtak kan ni sih a,” a ta."
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.,"Chun, chu rama inthawk chun anni tir hmang lo dingin Isu kuomah a ngên ṭal tah a."
Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding.,"Chun, chutaka tlâng panga chun vawk ruol tamtak an tlah a."
"And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.","Chun, khawhri inthieng nawhai chun, “Vawkhai kuoma sawn mîn fêtir rawh; an sûnga kan lût theina dingin,” tiin a kuomah an ngên a."
"And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.","Ama chun a phal pêk a. Chuongchun, khawhri inthieng naw- hai chu an suok a, vawkhai sûnga chun an lût a, chuongchun, vawk ruol chu (sâng hni lai an na) rawlah an tlân thlah a, dîlah an tlân lût a; chuongchun, dîla chun tui an inhâk hlum tah a."
"And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.","Chun, a vâituhai chu an tlân a, khuo le lohaia dâm chun an hril a. Chun, “Ieng am a ni ta leh?” tia en dingin an hung khâwm tâwl a."
"And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion: and they were afraid.","Chun, Isu kuom an hung tlung a, khawhri iman, nuoia iman kha, puon sila, lungril ngai puta ṭhung an hmuh a, chuongchun, an ṭi tah a."
"And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.","Chun, a hretuhai chun khawhri imanpa chunga thil hung tlung zie le, vawk chanchinhai chu chuonghai kuoma chun an lo hril a."
And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.,"Chun, chuonghai chun Isu chu an rama inthawka suok dingin an ngên tah a."
"And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him.","Chun, lawnga a chuong ding lai takin, khawhri imanpa khan Isu kuoma um zing a ngên a."
"And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and how he had mercy on thee.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a phal nawh a, a kuomah, “I ina i ruolhai kuomah fe la, Lalpain thil a thawpêk che hi a ropuizie le a lunginsietzie che hi va hril rawh,” a ti ta lem a."
"And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.","Chuongchun, a feh a, Dekapoli khuohaia chun Isûn a ta dinga thil a thawpêkhai ropuizie chu a khêk vêlpui tah a; chun, mi po po chun mak an ti hle a."
"And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea.","Chun, Isu chu lawnga râl khing tieng a hung kai nâwk chun, mipui nasatak a kuomah an hung khâwm a, ama chu dîl panga chun a um a."
"And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jaïrus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet,","Chun, inkhâwmna hotuhai laia mi pakhat, a hming Jaira chu a hung a, Isu a hmu phingleh a ke bulah a bawkkhup a,"
"and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: I pray thee, that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.","“Ka naunu naupangte a thi vâng vâng a, a hung hara, a hung dam theina dingin, hunga a chunga i kut innghat dingin ka ngên che,” tiin a ngên ṭal a."
"And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.","Chuongchun, Isu chu ama le chun an va feh a, chun, mipui nasatakin an zui a, an hneng sup sup a."
"And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,","Chun, nuhmei pakhat kum sâwmpahni thipûtin a damnawh a,"
"and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,","dâktawr tamtak kuomah nasa- takin a tuor tah a, a nei po po khawm chu a sêng zo tah a, ṭhathnem nêkin a zuol deu deu lem a."
"having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.","Chu minu chun Isu chanchin a lo hriet a, a hnungah mipui lai chun a hung a, a puon chu a them a,"
"For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole.","“A puon chau khawm them lang sukdamin um el ka tih,” a ti lungril a nih."
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.,"Chuongchun, kârloin a thipût chu a hung bo nghâl tah a, a natna chu sukdam a ni tah ti a taksa chun ân hriet tah a."
"And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?","Chun, Isu chun a sûnga thil- thawtheina chu a suok ti a lo hriet a, mipui lai chun a ngha vêl nghâl tah a, “Tu am a na ka puon them kha?” a ta."
"And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?","Chun, a inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Mipuiin an hneng sup sup che hi i hmu nghâl a, ‘Tu am a na a mi them,?’ iengtiziea ti am i na?” an ta."
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.,"Chun, ama chun a themtu chu hmu tumin a en vêl a."
"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun a chunga Isu thil thawzie chu hrein ṭi le inthin pumin a hung a, a hmaah a bawkkhup a, a kuomah thu indik- takin a hril vawng tah a."
"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ka naunu, i ringna hi i dampui a nih, lungmuongtakin fe la, i natna chu lo dam sawng ta raw se,” a ta."
"While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further?","A la ṭawng zing laiin in- khâwmna in hotu ina inthawkin mi an hung a, “I naunu a thi tah, ieng- dingin am inchûktirtu hi la suksâwl rawp i ta?” an ta."
"But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.","Isu ruok chun, an thu hril chu ngaisak loin inkhâwmna in hotu kuoma chun, “Ṭi naw, awi el rawh,” a ta."
"And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.","Chun, Peter hai, Jakob hai, Jakob unau Johan hai chau naw chu tukhawm ama zui ve a phal ta nawh a."
"And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and many weeping and wailing greatly.","Chun, inkhâwmna in hotu in chu an va tlung a, Isu chun an lo buoi mur mur le, an lo ṭap veng vung a, an khêk tuor tuor chu a va hmuh a."
"And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.","Chun, a va lût chun, an kuomah, “Iengdinga inri veng vunga ṭap am in na? naupang chu a thi nawh, a in lem a nih,” a ta."
"And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was.","Anni hlak chun an nuisan el a; ama hlak chun an rêngin a hnawt dawk a, naupang nu le pa le a kuoma umhai chu a ṭhuoi a, naupang umnaa chun a va lût a."
"And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.","Chun, naupang kut chu a chel a, a kuoma chun, “Talitha kumi,” a ta. Chu chu, “Bawinu tho rawh ka ti che,” tina a nih."
"And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement.","Chun, naupangnu chu a hung tho a, a fe thei nghâl tah a; ama chu kum sâwmpahni mi a ni hrim tah a. Chun, anni chun namênin mak an ti nawh a."
And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that something should be given her to eat.,"Chun, amân an kuomah, “Hi hi tukhawmin hre naw raw hai se,” a ti tlat a, chun fâk ding pêk ding thu a pêk tah a."
And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him.,"Chutaka chu a suok a, a umna khuo tieng chu a tlung nâwk tah a; inchûktirhai chun an zui pei a."
"And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and what mean such mighty works wrought by his hands?","Chun, Châwlni a hung na, inkhâwmna inah ân chûktir tah a. Chuongchun, mi tamtak a thu hre hai chun, “Hi mipa hin hieng thu hi khawlaia inthawka a hriet am a na? Hi mipa kuoma pêka um hi ieng varna am a na? A kut ngeiin thil mak tak tak a thaw hi iengtizie am a na?"
"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.","Hi mipa hi Mari naupa, Jakob hai, Jose hai, Juda hai, Simon hairawi unaupa, thingrem siemtu kha a ni naw am a nih? A farnuhai khawm hitaka ei kuoma um an ni nâwm a nih?” an ta, mak an ti hle a. Chuongchun, a chungah an lungni ta nawh a."
"And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Zâwlnei chu ama khuo tienga dâm, ama laibunghai lai dâm, ama ina hai dâm chau naw chun inpâk loin a um ngai nawh,” a ta."
"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.","Chun, mi damnaw tlâwmte chunga kut innghata a sukdam ti chau naw chu, chu hmuna chun thil- mak dang hrim a thaw thei nawh a."
And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.,"An awi nawna chu mak a ti hle a. Chun, inchûktir pum peiin khuohai chu a fang vêl a."
"And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;","Chun, sâwm le pahni hai chu a ko a, pahni peiin a tir suok tah a; khawhri inthieng nawhai chunga thuneina a pêk bawk a."
"and he charged them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse;","Chun, inzinnaa ding chun fung- hrawl chau naw chu iengkhawm– bei khawm, mansa khawm, an kâwng- khiah tangka khawm–châwi lo ding a ti tlat a,"
"but to go shod with sandals: and, said he, put not on two coats.","kekawk ruok chu bun ding a tih a. “Zakuo pahni hâk naw ro,” a ti bawk a."
"And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Khawlai khawm in tlungna ina chun chu hmuna inthawka in suok nâwk hmakhat chu, tlung zing pei ro."
"And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them.","Chun, khâwlai khuo khawmin an lâwm naw cheu a, in thu an ngâi nawna poah, chutaka inthawka in suok pha chun, anni inhriettirna dingin in kepha hnuoia pilvut kai chu thinthla ro,” a ta."
"And they went out, and preached that men should repent.","Chuongchun, an fe suok a, mipuihai kuomah simna thu an hril a."
"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.","Khawhrihai tamtak an hnawt- suok a, damnaw tamtak khawm sahriek an nâl a, an sukdam bawk a."
"And king Herod heard thereof; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.","Chun, lal Herod chun a lo hriet a, a hming chu a lo inthang ta sih a, “Baptistu Johan kha mithi laia inthawkin a hung tho nâwk tah a; chuleiin, chuong thilthawtheinahai chun amaa chun sin a thaw a ni chu,” a ta."
"But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even as one of the prophets.","Mi dang ruok chun, “Elija a ni chu,” an ta; mi dangin, “Zâwlnei a ni chu, zâwlneihai laia pakhat ang kha,” an ta."
"But Herod, when he heard thereof, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.","Herod ruok chun a lo hrietin, “Johan, a lu ka itanpa ngei kha a hung tho nâwk a ni chu,” a ta."
"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.","Herod ngei chun a unaupa Philip nuhmei Herodi leiin mi a tir suok a, Johan chu ân mantir a, intângna inah phierin a lo khum ta sih a; Herodi chu nuhmeiin a lo nei ta leiin;"
"For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.","Johan chun Herod kuomah, “I unaupa nuhmei i nei pêk hi a thieng naw a nih,” a lo ti ta bawk a."
"And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;","Chuleichun, Herodi chun ama chu a ngei naw rân el a, sukhlum a nuom a; nisienlakhawm, a thei si nawh a;"
"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.","Herodin Johan chu mi fel le mi inthiengtak a nih ti a hriet leiin ama chu a ṭih a, a hum tlat sih a, a thu a ngai chun a lunginzîng hle hlak a: nisienlakhawm, lâwm takin a ngai hlak a."
"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;","Chun, Herod chun a pieng ni champha phâk nia a mi ropuihai, sipai hotu lienhai dâm, Galili rama mi lienhai rawi ta dinga, zâna ruoi a ṭhe laiin hun remchâng a hung um tah a."
"and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.","Herodi naunu ngei chu a hung lût a, a lâm a, Herod le a thlaithlêng awtpuituhai chu a suklâwm tah a; chuongchun, lal chun naupangnu kuoma chun, “I dit dit mi hni rawh, pêng ka ti che,” a ta."
"And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.","“Iengkhawm i mi hni phawt chu, ka ram chenve rau khawm pêng ka ti che,” tiin a kuomah a lo inkhâm ta bawk a."
"And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.","Chun, ama chu a suok a, a nu kuoma chun, “Ieng am hnîng ka ta?” a va ta. Chun, ama chun, “Baptistu Johan lu,” a lo ta."
"And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.","Chun, ama chu inhmawtakin lal kuoma chun a va lût nghâl tah a, “Thlêngin Baptistu Johan lu i mi pêk nghâl ka nuom a nih,” tîn a hnih a."
"And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.","Chun, lal chu a lungngai ta bêk bêk el a; nisienlakhawm, ân khâm- nahai le a thlaithlêng awtpuituhai lei chun a sêl nuom nawh a."
"And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,","Chun, lal chun a vêngtu sipai pakhat a tir nghâl tah a, a lu chu hung lâk ding thu a pêk a. Chun, ama chun intângna ina chun a lu a va tan a,"
"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.","a lu chu thlêngin a hung lâk a, naupangnu kuoma chun a pêk a, ama chun a nu kuomah a pêk a."
"And when his disciples heard thereof, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.","Chun, a închûktirhai chun an hriet phingleh a ruong chu an vân hlawm a, thlânah an inzâl tah a."
"And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught.","Chun, tirkohai chu Isu kuomah an hung inkhâwm a, iengkim an thil thaw ta hai, an thu inchûktir tahai po po chu an hril a."
"And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni rawi ngawtin thlalêr hmunah a tumin hung unla, châwl phawt ro,” a ta. (Mi tamtak an insûl zut zut a, bu takngiel khawm an fâk hman nghâl nawh a.)"
And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.,"Chuongchun, thlalêr tieng lawngin a tumin an va fe tah a."
"And the people saw them going, and many knew them, and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.","Chun, an va fe lai chu mipuihai chun an hmuh a, mi tamtakin anni chu an hriet a, khaw tina inthawkin chu hmuna chun kein an tlân khâwm a, an lo lekhal tah a."
"And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.","Chuongchun, ama chu a hung suok chun, mipui nasatak a hmuh a, vêngtu nei naw berâmhai ang an ni leiin a lunginsiet bêk bêk a; thu tamtak ân chûktir tah a."
"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;","Chun, khuo chu a hung inhnu ta hle a, a inchûktirhai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Ahi thlalêr hmun a na, khuo khawm ân hnu ta bawk nghâl a."
"send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat.","Anni rawi hi ei kâwl vêl loa dâm le khuoa dâm an fâk ding ieng amanih bêk an inchâwk theina dingin infetir tâwl ta la,” an ta."
"But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread, and give them to eat?","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn fâk ding pe ta unla,” tiin a dawn a. Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Bei duli zahni man vân chawin fâk ding kan pêk ding am a nih?” an ta."
"And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Beiphêk iengzât am in nei a? hung en ta u,” a ta. Chun, an nei zât an hriet phingleh, “Panga, ngatê pahni leh,” an ta."
And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.,"Chun, ama chun, an rêngin hlo hring chunga chun apâwl peia inṭhungtir dingin an kuomah thu a pêk a."
"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.","Chun, atlarin za khat dâm, sâwmnga dâm peiin an ṭhung tâwl a."
"And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.","Chun, ama chun bei panga le ngatê pahni chu a lâk a, vân tieng nghain mal a sâwm a, beiphêkhai chu a khawi a, mipui chu infâktir dingin a inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a, ngate pahni khawm chu mi po po lai chun a sem a."
"And they all ate, and were filled.","Chun, an rêngin an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a."
"And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes.","Chun, bei nâwi le nga nâwihai chu bâwm sâwm le pahni an rût sip a."
And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.,Bei fatuhai chu patling ruok khawm sâng nga hiel an nih.
"And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away.","Chun, ama ngeiin mipui chu ân ṭintir sûngin râl khing tienga Bethsaidaa lo fe hmasa dingin a inchûktirhai chu lawngah ân chuong tir nghâl tah a."
"And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.","Chun, anni ân ṭintir hnung chun ṭawngṭai dingin tlangah a fe tah a."
"And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.","Chun, zântieng inhnu deu a hung ni chun lawng chu dîl lai taka chun a lo um a, ama chu a khât chauin khawmuola chun a um a."
"And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:","Chun, an lawng kar chu an lung a zîng hlein a hmu a, thliin aninaw tieng panga a mût leiin. Vârṭien ding lai vêlin dil chunga kea lâwnin anni tieng a hung pan a, anni chu fe khêl a tum a."
"but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun ama chu dîl chunga kea lâwn an hang hmu chun thlâ amanih an sâwn a, an khêk ta rak el a; an rêngin ama an hmuh a, an thlaphâng hle a."
"for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun anni chu a biek nghâl tah a, an kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin um ro, keima ka nih annâwm, ṭi naw ro,” a ti tah a."
And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves;,"Chun, lawnga chun an kuomah a hang chuong ve a, thli hrang chu a ma tah a; chuongchun, an lungril chun mak an ti hle a,"
"for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.","bei thu kha a ngaina an hriet- thiem si nawh a, an lungril a ngar leiin."
"And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.","Chun, râl khingtieng an kai chun Gennesaret ram, khawmuol an tlung a, vapanga chun lawng chu an thlung a."
"And when they were come out of the boat, straightway the people knew him,","Chun, lawnga inthawka an suok chun, mihai chun ama chu an lo hriet nghâl tah a;"
"and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.","chu ram vêla chun an tlân vêl ta sup sup a, a um ti an hrietna taphawta chun damnawhai dâm an zâlphaa zâl pum zingin an zâwn vêl ta ruoi el a."
"And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.","Chun, khaw chînhaia dâm, khaw lienhaia dâm, lohaia dâm, khawlai a lûtna taphawta chun damnawhai chu dâwr hmuna dâm an inzâltir tâwl a; a puon hmawr bêk khawm them thei an hnih a.

"And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,","Chun, Pharisaihai le Dân inchûk- tirtuhai laia mi tuhai amanih Jerusalema inthawka hunghai chu a kuomah an hung inkhâwm a."
"and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.",Chuonghai chun a închûktir aṭhenhaiin kut bala bei an fâk an lo hmuh tah a. Bal ti hi sâwplo tina a nih.

"And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?","Chuongchun, Pharisaihai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun, “Iengdinga i închûktirhai hin ruolhlui thurosie ang peia um loa kut bala bei an fâk el hlak am a na?” tiin an indawn a."
"And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Isai hin nangni mi vervêkhai thu a lo hrillâwk dik zet el– ‘Hi hairawi hin an bauin an mîn pâk a, An lungril ruok chun an mi hlat sih a."
"But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.","An inchûktirnaa mihriem thupêkhai an inchûktir leiin, An mi biek khawm hi a thlâwn el a nih,’ ti ziek ang khan."
"Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.","Pathien thupêkhai chu lung- kham loin, mihriem thurosie chu in chel tlat a ni hi,” a ta."
"And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuom- ah, “Nangni thurosiehai in pawm theina dingin Pathien thupêkhai chu in dit naw hi, rem chu in hriet ngawt hi aw!"
"For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:","Mosiein, ‘I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ ‘Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih hrilse taphawt chu thi mawl raw se,’ a ti sih a;"
"but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God;","nangni ruok chun hieng hin in ti hlak a, ‘Mîn a nu amanih, a pa amani kuomah, I mi sawrna ding hi Korban a ni tah,’ a ti chun, (chu chu Pathien kuoma pêk tina a nih),"

"making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.","in thurosie peksâwng hin Pathien thu chu in baw hmang hlak a nih; chuong ang chu tamtak in thaw hlak,” a ta."
"And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:","Chun, mipui chu a ko nâwk a, an kuomah, “In rêngin ka thu hi lo ngâi seng unla, a ngâi lo thiem ta u;"
"there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.","Mihriem puotienga inthawka a phîng sûnga lût ama sukthieng naw thei iengkhawm a um nawh, mihriem phîng sûnga inthawka hung suokhai chu mihriem sukthieng nawtu an ni lem a nih,” a ta."
,[Tukhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se.]
"And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.","Chun, mipuihai chu ina a lûtsan hnungin, a inchûktirhaiin tekhithu chu ama an indawn fel a."
"And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him;","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni khawm chuong ang lâwma hrietna nei naw in ni maw? Hi hi in hriet naw maw?

"because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? This he said, making all meats clean.","a lungrila lût loin, a phîngah a lût a, inhnâwmnaah a suok lem hlak leiin, ti hi?” a ta. (Chu chu fâkding tin rêng fâk a thieng, a tina a nih.)"
"And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.","Chun, ama bâwkin, “Mihriem phîng sûnga inthawka hung suok chun, chu tak chun mihriem a sukthieng naw hlak a nih."
"For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,","Sûng tienga um mihriem lungrila inthawkhai chun, ngaituona suol dâm a hung suok hlak nghâl a; inditna dâm, inrûkna dâm, tuol- thatna dâm, uirena dâm,"

"all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.","chuong suolhai po po chu sûngtienga inthawkin a hung suok a, mihriem chu a sukthieng naw hlak a nih,” a ta."
"And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.","Chun, a tho a, chutaka inthawk chun Tura le Sidon bielah a fe tah a, chun, inah a lût a, tu ihriet khawm a nuom nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ân thup thei si nawh."
"But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.","Chuongchun, nuhmei pakhat naunu khawhri inthieng naw iman nei chun a chanchin a lo hriet a, a ke bulah a va bawkkhup nghâl tah a."
"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.","Chu nuhmei chu Grik mi a na, insiengna tieng chu Surophoiniki mi a nih. Ama chun a naunu sûnga khawhri hnawt dawk dingin a ngên a."
"And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Nauhai chu khawp hmasa phawt raw hai se, nauhai bei lâkpêk a, uihai kuoma pêk a mawi nawh ie,” a ta."
"But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, ni chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, dawkân hnuoia uihai khawmin nauhai bei nâwi chu an fâk hlak annâwm,” tiin a dawn a."
"And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.","Chun, ama chun, “I thu hril lei chun fe ta raw le; khawhri chu i naunu sûnga inthawkin a suok tah,” a ta."
"And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.","Chun, a ina chun a fe tah a, a nau chu khawhri isuoksan zoa khuma zâl a va hmu tah a."
"And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.","Chun, Tura rama inthawkin a suok nâwk a, Sidon khuo sirin Dekapoli ram fe thleng peiin Galili dîl chu a tlung tah a."
"And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.","Chun, mi pakhat nasêt, ṭawng khawm ṭawng fel thei lo hi a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a, a chunga a kut innghat dingin an ngên a."
"And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;","Chun, ama chun mipui laia chu, a khât chauin a tumin a ṭhuoi a, a kutpârhaiin a nakuo chu a khîkpêk a, chil a sâk a, a lei a them pêk a."
"and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.","Chun, vân tieng nghain ân thuok huoi a, a kuomah, “Ephatha,” a ta. Chu chu, “Lo inhawng rawh,” tina a nih."
"And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.","Chuongchun, a nahai chu a hung inhawng a, a lei khitna khawm chu a hung insût a, chiengtakin a ṭawng thei tah a."
"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah tukhawm hril lo ding a ti tlat a; nisienlakhawm, a khap nasa deu leh, an khêk vêl pui nasa hman hlak a."
"And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.","“Ama chun iengkim ṭhatakin a thawh a; nasêt dâm a sukvarpêk a, ṭawng thei naw dâm khawm ân ṭawngtir hlak,” an ta, mak an ti nasa bêk bêk a."
"In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,","Chuong lai chun mipui tamtak an hung um nâwk a, chuonga fâk ding iengkhawm an nei naw lai chun, ama chun a închûktirhai chu a ko a, an kuomah,"
"I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:","“Tûn mipuihai hi ka kuomah ni thum an um tah a, fâk ding ieng- khawm an nei naw leiin ka lunginsiet bêk bêk a nih."
"and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far.","Bu ngheia an in tieng kân fetir el chun, lam kâr lakah an châu ding a ni sih a, a ṭhen lem chu an hungna a hla hle sih a,” a ta."
"And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?","Chun, a închuktirhai chun, “Tuin am hienghai rawi hi sukkhawp thei an ta?” tiin ama an dawn a."
"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.","Chun, ama chun, “Beiphêk iengzât am in nei a?” tiin anni chu ân dawn a. Chun, anni chun, “Phêk sari,” an ta."
"And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.","Chun, mipuihai chu hnuoia ṭhung dingin thu a pêk a, chuong- chun, bei phêk sari chu a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin a khawi a; anni laia sem dingin a închûktirhai a pêk a; chuongchun, mipui lai chun an sem tah a."
"And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.","Ngatê tlâwmte an nei bawk a, ama chun chu khawm chu mal a sâwm a, chuonghai khawm chu mipui laia sem ding thu a pêk a."
"And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.","Chuongchun, an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a; an fâk mahla nawi khawm chu bâwmrâng sari zet an rût sip a."
And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.,Anni rawi chu sâng li lai an na; ama chun anni chu ân ṭintir tah a.
"And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.","Chun, ama chu a închûktirhai lai lawngah a chuong nghâl tah a. Dalmanutha ram chu a tlung tah a."
"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.","Chun, Pharisaihai an hung a, ama fiena dingin amaa vâna inthawka inchikna zawngin ama chu an sêl tah a."
"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.","Chun, ama chu a lungrilah nasatakin ân rûm a, “Iengdinga tulaia ruoltharhai hin inchikna an zawng am a na?

"And he left them, and again entering into the boat departed to the other side.","Chun, anni chu a mâksan a, râl khing tieng a fe tah a."
And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.,"Chun, a închûktirhai chun bei an chawi theinghil a, bei phêk khat chau naw chu lawnga chun bei dang hrim hrim an nei si nawh a."
"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.","Chun, ama chun, “Pharisaihai chawl le Herod chawla chun invêng ṭha unla, ṭi dêkin um ro,” a ti tlat a."
"And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.","Chun, anni chun, “Bei ei nei dêr nawh a,” tîn an in ngaituoh a."
"And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?","Chun, Isûn chu chu a lo hriet a, an kuomah, “Bei in nei naw leisek chun iengdinga in inngaituo am?

"When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.","Sâng nga laia bei phêk nga ka khawi lai khan a nâwi kha bâwm iengzât am in rût sip kha? In la hriet zing naw maw?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Sâwm le pahni,” an ta."

"And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Tu khawm hin a ngaina in la hriet rawp naw maw?” a ti tah a."
"And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.","Chun, Bethsaida chu an hung tlung a. Chun, a kuomah mitdel an hung ṭhuoi a, ama chu them dingin Isu an ngên a."
"And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?","Chun, ama chun mitdel kut chu a chel a, khaw kâwl tieng a fepui a; chun, a mita chun chil a sâk a, a chungah a kut ân nghat zoin, “I hmu thei ta?” tîn ân dawn a."
"And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking.","Chun, a hang tang a, “Mihriem chu ka hmuh a, anachu thing lâwn angin ka hmuh,” a ta."
"Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.","Chun, a mita chun a kut ân nghat nawk a, chuongchun, ama chun a en zing a, a hung dam el tah a, iengkim chiengtakin a hmu thei tah a."
"And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.","Chun, Isu chun, “Khuoa khawm hin lût ta naw la,” tîn a in tieng ân fetir tah a."
"And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Cæsarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?","Chun, Isu le a închûktirhai chu an fe suok a, Philip Kaisari khawperhaia chun an feh a; chun, fe malamin a închûktirhai kuomah, “Mihaiin tu am a nih an mi tih a?” tiin ân dawn a."
"And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.","Anni chun, “ ‘Baptistu Johan an ti cheh a’; mi dangin ‘Elija,’ a ṭhen ruok chun, ‘Zâwlnei tu amanih’ an ti cheh a,” tiin an hril a."

And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.,"Chun, ama chun a chanchin thu chu tukhawm hril lo ding a ti tlat a."
"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.","Chun, Mihriem Naupa chun thil tamtak a tuor dingzie dâm, upahai, thiempu lalhai le, Dân inchûktir- tuhai dit nawa a um ding dâm, sukhluma a la um ding dâm, ni thum hnunga a thonâwk dingzie dâm anni ân chûktir phut tah a."
"And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.","Chuong thu chu chiengtakin a hril a. Chun, Peter chun ama chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a, a kâwk a."
"But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.","Ama ruok chu a ngha kîr a, a închûktirhai chu a en a, “Setan, ka hnungah fe rawh.

"For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?","Mîn khawvêl hi a pumin nei sienla, a hringna chân si sienla, ieng am ṭhahnem a ta?"
For what should a man give in exchange for his life?,Mîn a hringna sikin ieng am pe thei a ta?
"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","Tukhawm tulai ruolthar uire le suksuol hmanghai laia kei le ka thu inzapuihai po chu, Mihriem Naupa hin vântirko inthienghai le a Pa ropuinaa inthuoma a hung pha chun, ama chu hung inzapui ve thung a tih,” a ta"

"And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them;","Chun, ni ruk hnungin Isûn Peter hai, Jakob hai, Johan hai, chu a ṭhuoi a, a tumin tlâng insângtakah anni chau chu a hang fepui a, an hmaa chun a hmêl umzie chu a hung dang- lam tah a."

And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.,"Chun, Elija le Mosie chu an kuomah an hung inlâr a, Isu le chun an inbiek tah a."
"And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.","Chun, Peterin Isu a biek a, “Rabbi, ei ta dingin hitaka um hi a ṭha; bâwkte pathum khâwng ei ta, I ta dingin pakhat, Mosie ta dingin pakhat, Elija ta dingin pakhat,” a ta."

"And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves.","Chun, an hang en vêl vak a, Isu chau naw chu tukhawm an kuomah chun an hmu ta nawh a."
"And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead.","Chun, tlânga inthawk an ṭum laiin, Mihriem Naupa mithi laia a thonâwk hnunga chau naw chu an iengkhat hmuhai chu tukhawm hril naw ding a ti tlat a."

"And he asked them, What question ye with them?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Annihai rawi leh ieng thu am a na in insêl?” tîn ân dawn a."
"And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;","Mipui laia mi pakhatin an kuomah, “Inchuktirtu, ka naupa khawhri ṭawng thei naw iman chu i kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi a."
"and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.","A manna taphawtah a sukthlûk rak hlak a, chuongchun, a chil- huomhai a tlah a, a hahai a rawt a, a chêr tieu tieu a.

"And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.","Chun, ama chu Isu kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; chuongchun, khawhri chun ama a hmu phingleh, naupang chu nasatakin a sawisa nghâl tah a; chuongchun, hnuoiah a tluh a, chilhuom tla reiruiin ân tleng ta tawp tawp a."

"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, How is it that we could not cast it out?","Chun, Isu chu in a va lût chun, a închûktirhaiin, “Iengdinga keinîn kan hnawt dawk thei naw am a na?” tiin fienrielah an indawn a."
