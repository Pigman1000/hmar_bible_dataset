"The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.","Juda lal Jotham, Ahaz le Hezekia hai inlal laia Moreseth mi Mika kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung, Samaria khuo le Jerusalem chung- châng thu a hmu chu."
"Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.","Nangni chihai, in rêngin hre unla, aw leihnuoi le a sûnga um po pohai; ngai ro, Lalpa PATHIEN, Lalpa chu a biekin inthienga inthawkin nangni kala in chungthu hretu ni raw se."
"For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.","Ngai ta u, LALPA chu a hmuna inthawkin a hung suok a, hung ṭum a ta, hnuoi hmun insânghai chu a chîl ding a ni sih a."
"And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.","Mei bula khuoihlu ang le hmun inṭêna tui inkhaw thla ang elin, tlânghai chu a hnuoia chun intui an ta, vadung ruomhai chu kakintan an tih."
"For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?",Hieng po po hi Jakobhai baw- sietna le Israel sûngkuohai suolna lei a nih. Jakobhai bawsietna chu ieng am a na? Samaria ni lo am a nih? Juda bâwlhmunhai chu ieng am a na? Jerusalem ni lo am a nih?
"Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, and as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof.","Chuleiin, Samaria chu phûla thil se um khâwm angin siem ka ta, grêp huon hmun ang elin; chun, chu hmuna lunghai chu vadung ruom tieng inhlum thlâng ka ta, a lung- phûmhai chu suklang ka tih."
"And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.","A milim siemfâwmhai po po chu sukkawi hâwp vawng nîng an ta; a nawchizawr manhai chu meia raw hmang nîng a tih, a milimhai po po chu sukbohmang ka tih; nawchizawr mana a lâk khâwm a ni leiin, nawchizawr man bawkin ṭhang an tih."
"For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.","Hi hi lei hin ṭap ka ta, khêk rak rak ka ta, inhlîp le saruokin um ka ta, sihalhai angin khêk ka ta, varîng- seihai angin inrûm ka tih."
"For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.","A hliemnahai chu sukdam thei a ni nawh; Juda ram a tlung ta hiel sih a; ka mihai kawtkhâr, Jerusalem meu khawm a tlung a nih."
"Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.","Gath khuoa chun hril naw unla, ṭap dêr naw ro; Beth-le-Aphra khuoa chun pilvutah inbuol rawh."
"Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.","Aw Sapphir mi, saruok le inzak- takin fe hmang rawh; Zaanan mi chu a hung suok nawh; Bethezel ṭapna chun ngîr chankhal a ti cheu."
"For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem.","Maroth mi chun chanṭha chang a nghâkhla hlie hlie el a, LALPA kuoma inthawka thil ṭha naw chu Jerusalem kawtkhâr bul chena a hung tlung thlâk leiin."
"Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.","Aw Lakis mi, tawlailîr chu sakawr hrâta chun bel rawh; ama hi Zion naunu suolna bul a nih, Israel- hai bawsietnahai chu nangmaa hin a um a lo ni sih a."
Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.,"Chuleiin, Moreseth-gath kuoma chun inthlana thilpêk i pêk ding a nih: Akzik inhai chu Israel lalhai ta dingin hlêmna nîng a tih."
"I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.","Aw Maresa mi, nangma neitu ding i kuomah la hung ṭhuoi ka tih; Israelhai ropuina chu Adullam chen rauin hung a tih."
"Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.","Invâw kawl la, i nau dittakhai lei chun invâw kawl rawh; mulukawl ang elin insukkawl nasa rawh, i kuoma inthawka sala ṭhuoiin an um ta sih a."
"Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.","An khum laizâwla khawhlona suongtuotuhai le thil ṭha naw ngaituo suoktuhai chu an chung a rik de! Zîngkâra khuo a hung var hin chu chu an thaw hlak a, anni kut thil- thawtheina a ni si leiin."
"And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.","Mi lohai an inhnar a, an lâkpêk a, inhai an inhnar a, an lâk el bawk a; mi le an sûnghai, mi le an ro chenin an hnuoisieh a."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.","Chuleiin, LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih: Ngai ta, hi sûngkaw chunga hin thil ṭha naw ka suongtuo a nih; chutaka inthawk chun in rîng la hmang naw ti niu a, chapotakin fe ta naw bawk in tih; hun ṭha naw a ni ding a ni sih a."
"In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove it from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.","Chu nia chun nangni demin tekhithu hril an ta, ṭap hla lungriem- ithlâk umtaka inzâwtin, “Rawk vawngin ei um tah a nih, ka mihai chan a sukdanglam a, ka kuoma inthawkin a tâwl hmang tah a ni hi! Hel hmanghai kuomah ei lo a sem dar tah a ni hi,” tîng an tih."
Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.,"Chuleiin, LALPA mihai in- khâwmhai lai chun aisân a, hruia inkhipêktu tukhawm nei naw ti ni."
"Prophesy ye not, thus they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.","“Thu hril naw rawh,” tiin an hril hlak a. Hieng mihai kuoma hin thu hril naw ni hai, hrilsietna chu inkieng naw bawk a tih."
"Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?","Aw Jakob sûnghai, LALPA thla- rau chu hnâwdein a um am a nih? Hieng hi a thilthaw am a ni ti a ni dîm a nih? Indiktaka umhai chunga chun ka thu hin thil ṭha a thaw naw am a nih?"
But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka mihai chu tulai hnaia hin hmêlma angin an hung ngîrdawk a nih; indo nuom lo a, râlmuongtaka mi inlawnhaia in- thawkin an silfên zakawfuolhai in hlîppêk a."
The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.,"Ka mi nuhmeihai chu an in in- hawitaka inthawkin in hnawt dawk a, an naupangtêhaia inthawkin ka ropuina chu in lâk hmang sawng a nih."
"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.","Tho unla, fe hmang ro; hi hi in châwlna hmun a ni si nawh a; sietna nasatak chena sukse hlaktu in- thiengnawna chu a um leiin."
"If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.","Mumal neilo le indik nawtaka, “Uoin le zu thu i kuomah hril ka tih,” tia miin khêl a hril chun hieng mihai zâwlnei hi ni chau a tih."
"I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.","Aw Jakobhai, in rêngin ko khâwm ngei ka ti cheu a; Israel mi la um sunhai chu ṭhuoi khâwm ngei ka tih; Bozra khaw berâm angin sie khâwm ka ta, ran ruol an hlo petna hmuna um angin; mipui an ni lei chun sa mur mur an tih."
"The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.","Nêr thlengtu chu an hmaa chun fêng a ta, nêr thleng an ta, kawtkhâr chenin fe pei an ta, chutaka chun fe suok an tih: chun, an lal chu an hmaa chun fêng a ta, LALPA chun an hma ṭhuoi a tih."
"And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?","Aw nangni Jakobhai hotuhai le Israel sûngkuo rorêltuhai; ngai unla, ka ngên cheu hi, ka ti a nih; rorêl dân chu in hriet ding an nâwm a nih?"
"ye who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;","Thil ṭha in theida a, thil ṭha naw in ngaituoh a, an vun in inhlippêk a, an rua inthawkin taksa chu in sâwk- thlâk a,"
"who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.","ka mihai sa in fâk bawk a, an vun an khawk thlâk a, an ru an suk- tliekpêk a; anih, bêla suong ding angin an chan nawi a, sabêl sûnga sa chan nawi ang elin."
"Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.","Chu pha chun LALPA chu ko an ta, nisienlakhawm, anni chu dawn naw nih: anih, chu pha chun an thil thawah an thaw ṭhat nawzie ang peiin, an kuom tieng a hmai thup a tih."
"Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:","Ka mihai insuksuoltirtu, sawi nei pumin, “Muongna,” tia khêk a, an baua inba naw taphawt do buotsai hieltu zâwlneihai chungchâng thu chu LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih:"
"Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.","Chuleiin, inlârna in nei naw hielna dingin in kuomah zân hung tlung a ta, ai in sân thei nawna khawpin in kuomah inthimna hung tlung a tih; zâwlneihai ta ding chun nisa liem a ta, sûn khawm an chunga chun khaw inthim nîng a tih."
"And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.","Hmutheituhai chu inzak an ta, aisânthiemhai chu muolpho an tih; anih, an rêngin an hmûr hup an tih; Pathien dawnna a um si nawh a."
"But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.","Nisienlakhawm, Jakobhai kuom- a an bawsietna inhriettir dingin le, Israelhai kuoma an suolna inhriettir dingin LALPA thlarau leia thil- thawtheina dâm, rorêlna dâm le hrâtna dâm chun ka sip takzet a nih."
"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity.","Nangni Jakobhai sûngkaw hotu- hai le Israel sûngkaw hotuhai le Israel sûngkaw rorêltu, rorêlna tir- daka, indikna tinrêng suklinglettu- hai, hi hi lo ngai ro, ka ngên cheu hi."
"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.","Zion chu thisenin an bâwl a, Jerusalem chu khawhlonain."
"The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.","Chutaka hotuhai chun lâwm- man beiseiin ro an rêl a, chutaka thiempuhai chun hlaw beiseiin an inchûktir a, chutaka zâwlneihai chun tangka beiseiin ai an sân a nih: Chuong sa khawm chun, “LALPA chu eini lai a um naw am a nih? Thil ṭha naw ei chungah hung tlung naw nih,” tiin LALPA chungah an innghat a nih."
"Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.","Chuleiin, Zion chu, nangni lei chun lo anga inlet nîng a ta, Jerusa- lem chu thil se um khâwm nîng a ta, biekin umna tlâng chu ramhnuoi hmun insâng ang nîng a tih."
"But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.","Nisienlakhawm, ni nuhnungahai chun hieng ang hi hung nîng a ta; LALPA in umna tlâng chu tlâng lien- hai chunga chun sukdet nîng a ta, tlâng chînhai chunga chun chawi- sângin um bawk a tih; chutaka chun chi tinrênghai chu fe hum hum an tih."
"And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;","Chun, hnam tamtakhai chu fêng an ta, “Hung unla, LALPA tlângah, Jakob Pathien ina chun hang fêng ei tiu; chuongchun, ama chun a lampui chanchinhai chu mîn chûktir a ta, a lampuihaia chun fêng ei ta, tîng an tih; Ziona inthawk chun dân thu chu a hung suok ding a ni sih a; LALPA thu chu Jerusalema inthawkin a hung suok ding a nih.”"
"and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.","Ama chun chi tamtak kârah ro rêl a ta, hlataka hnam hrâttak khawm chu kâwk a tih; chun, an kâwlhnâm- hai chu hnuoi inletna hmawr zum- haiah sut an ta, an feihai chu thei kûng ât bawngna chem inkuoihaiah sut an tih; hnam dangin hnam dang chungah kâwlhnâm inlet ta naw nih a, indo dân khawm inchûk ta naw bawk an tih."
But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.,"Mi tinhai chu an grêp hrui hnuoia le an theichang kûng hnuoiah ṭhung lem an ta, tukhawma sukṭi naw ni hai; sipaihai LALPA bau chun a hril tah a."
For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.,"Chi tin mâni pathien hming sengin um an ta, eini khawm LALPA ei Pathien hmingin kumkhuoin um ei tih."
"In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;","LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih: Chu nia chun kebai kei khâwm ka ta, hnawt hmanga um le ka sukrimsika um chu kei khâwm ka tih;"
"and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.","kebai chu hlâbîkah siem ka ta, hlataka hnawt hmanga um chu hnam hrâttakah siem ka tih: tuta inthawk chu Zion tlângah kumkhuoin LALPA chun an chungah ro rêl a tih."
"And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.","Aw nang, ran ruol kul, Zion naunu umna tlâng, i kuomah hung tlung a tih: anih, inlalna hmasa chu hung tlung a tih, Jerusalem naunu inlalna chu."
"Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?",Iengdinga i ṭap rak am a na? I sûngah laltak chu a um naw am a nih? I remruottu chu a bohmang ta am a nih? Nuhmei nau invawi anga natnain a man el ta che chu!
"Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.","Aw Zion naunu, nuhmei nau invawi nau nei ding angin na tuor la, invawi rawh; tuhin khawpuia in- thawk fe suok i ta, ramah chêng i tih.

"And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see our desire upon Zion.","Tuhin hnam tamtak chu nang- ma doin an inkhâwm a, “Sukpawr- chein um sienla, ei mit hin Zion chunga a châk zâwng chu hmu raw se,” an tih a."
"But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA ngai- tuonahai chu an hriet nawh a, a remruot chu an hriet thiem bawk nawh: hrizâwla buphal siekhâwm angin anni chu ân khâwm ta sih a."
"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.","Aw Zion naunu, tho la chîl rawh, i ki chu thîr angin siem ka ta, i kepha bâwrhai chu dâr angin ka siem ding a ni sih a; chun, chi tamtakhai chu vaw nâwi i ta, an thil hlêp chu LALPA ta dingin hlânthieng i tih, an sum chu leihnuoi pumpui LALPA ta dingin hlânthieng i tih."
"Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.","Aw sipai ruol naunu, tuhin sipai ruolah inpunkhâwm la, ama chun a mîn huol tah a na, Israelhai rorêltu chu a bekah hmawlin vuong an tih."
"But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.","Nisienlakhawm, nang Bethle- hem Ephratha, Juda rama sâng tamtakhai laia ṭhanga chun chîn hle la khawm, nangmaa inthawk hin Israelhai rorêltu ding chu ka ta ding hung suok a tih; a hung inṭanna chu tiena chatuona inthawk ta khan a nih."
"Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.","Chuleiin, nau invawitu chun a nei hmakhat chun anni chu nghatsan a tih: chuongchun, a unau la um sunhai chu Israel thlahai lai chun kîr nâwk an tih."
"And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.","Ama chu ngîr a ta, LALPA hrâtnain a ranruol chu châwm a tih: LALPA a Pathien hming ropuina ngei chun: chun, anni chu um zing an tih: ama chu hnuoi tâwp chenin a ropui ding a ni sih a."
"And this man shall be our peace. When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.","Chun, hi hi ei inremna ding nîng a tih, Assuria mi chu ei ramah a hung a, ei lal inhai a hung sir pha chun ama do dingin berâmpu pasari le mi ropui pariet inthlangsuok ei tih."
"And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.","Assuria ram chu kâwlhnâmin suksieng an ta, Nimrod ram chu a lûtnaa chun sukse bawk an tih; chun, ama chun ei ramah Assuria mi a hung a, ei ram chu a hung sir pha chun, amaa inthawk chun mi san- suok a tih."
"And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass, that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.","Jakob mi la um sun chu chi tamtakhai laia LALPAA inthawka daidaw tla ang le, hlobet chunga raw sûr angin um a tih, chu chun mihriem a nghâk nawh a, mihriem naupasal a nghâk bawk nawh."
"And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver.","Jakob mi hlâbîkhai chu hnamhai laia le chi tamtakhai laia chun ram- hnuoi sahai laia sakeibaknei ang le berâm ruol laia sakeibaknei vânglai angin um a tih; ama chun a fe thleng phawt chun, a sirde a, a keinâwi a, santu ding khawm tukhawm an um nawh."
"Let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.","I kut chu nangma dotuhai chunga inletin um sienla, i hmêl- mahai po po chu sukbohmangin um raw se."
"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots:","Chu nia chun, LALPAIN a tih, i kuoma inthawkin i sakawrhai sukbo- hmang ka ta, i tawlailîrhai suksieng ka tih:"
"and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.","i ram khawpuihai sukbohmang ka ta, i kul po po sukchim ka tih;"
And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:,"i kuta inthawkin dawi thiemna- hai chu sukbohmang ka ta, aisân thiemnahai chu nei ta naw ti ni;"
and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands;,i kuoma inthawkin i milim siemfâwmhai le i lungphunhai chu sukbohmang ka ta; i kutsuok thil chu be ta naw ti ni.
and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.,"I kuoma inthawk i Aserahai chu phawidawk ka ta, i khawpuihai chu suksieng ka tih."
And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.,"Chun, thu ngai naw hnamhai chunga chun lunginthakna le lungin- sennain phuba lâkna sukpuitling ka tih."
"Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.","LALPA thu hril chu tuhin lo ngai ta u: Tho la, tlâng lienhai hmaa chun khing la, tlâng chînhai chun i râwl ngai raw se."
"Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovah’s controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.","Aw tlâng lienhai, LALPA khing- na chu ngai unla, nangni leihnuoi innghatna hlunhai, lo ngai ro; LALPA chu a mihai leh an inkhing a, Israelhai chu khing a tih."

"For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.","Aigupta rama inthawk chun ka ṭhuoi suok cheu a, suoka inthawkin kân tlansuok cheu a, in hmaah Mosie hai le, Aron hai le Miriam hai ka hung tir kha."
"O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; remember from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.","Aw ka mihai, LALPA thilthaw fel chu in hriet theina dingin, Moab lal Balak thu rawt le Beor naupa Balaamin a dawn dân, Sittima in- thawka Gilgal chenin thil umziehai kha, tuhin hre zing ro.”"
"Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?","Ieng lêm LALPA hmaa chun hung ka ta, Pathien chunghnung hmaa chun kûn ka ta?

"will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?","LALPA chu berâmchal sâng tamtak amanih, hriek vadung sîng- haia dâm chun a lungawi ding am a nih?

"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?","Aw mihriem, a ṭha chu ân entir ta che a nih; LALPAIN a phût che chu ieng am a na?

"The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.","LALPA chun khawpui chu a khêkkhum a nih, varna nei mi chun i hming chu ṭîng a tih; “Hembâwk le a buotsaitu chu hre ro."
"Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?",Mi rilo ina chun rîtlona robâwmhai chu a la umin inkhina dawrâwm tirdakumtakhai chu a la um rawp am?
"Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?",Bûkna indik nawhai le ip rik dân dawhahai leh inthieng ka ni thei ding am a nih?
"For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.","Chutaka mi hausahai chu pâwngnêknain an sip sih a, chutaka chênghai chun khêl an hril a, an bau sûnga an lei chu mi hlêm hmang a nih."
Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.,"Chuleiin, kei khawma nataka hliemin ka vuok ta cheh a, i suolna- hai leiin râusanah ka siem ta che a nih."
"Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.","Fâk chu fâng i ta, nisienla- khawm, khawp naw ti ni; i kuoma chun i tlâwmna chu um a ta, sawn i ta, nisienlakhawm, himin thak hmang naw ti ni; i fe hmangpuihai khawm chu kâwlhnâmah pe suok tho ka tih."
"Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.","Chîng chu chîng i ta, sîk naw ti ni, oliv rahai chu sirsâwr i ta, nisien- lakhawm, a hriek chu nâl naw ti ni; grêp ra chu sâwr la khawm, a uoin chu dâwn naw ti ni."
"For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.","Omri thuruothai chu vawng zing a ni sih a, Ahab sûngkuo thil- thaw po pohai leh; an remruothaia chun in fe a nih; chuleiin, hmun râusanah ka siem ta ding che a nih, a sûnga chênghai hi nuizatbûr dingin; chun, ka mihai hmingsietna chu phur in tih.”"
"Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.",Ka chung a va rik de! nisapui thei an sîkkhâwm laia um ang le grêp lo hun laia grêp hmu ṭhel lo ding ang ka ni sih a; ra bâwr fâk ding a um nawh; ka hringna hin theichang hmin hmasa a châk a nih;
"The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.","Pathien ngaisak mi chu hnuoia inthawk hin an bohmang a, mihriem lai hin mi indiktak hrim an um nawh; thisen insuo dingin an inchân vawng a, mi tinin mâni unau chu lênin an ve a nih."
"Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.","An kuthai chu thil ṭha naw chungah taimataka thaw dingin an innghat a; lal chun thamna a ngên a, rorêltu chun lâwmman a ngiet a; milien chun a lungril thil suksuolna a hril suok a; chuong ang chun an inthuruol tâwl a nih."
"The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.","Anni laia mi ṭhatak khawm chu buor ang a na, mi indiktak khawm chu hlohlingnei nêkin a se lem; i vêngtuhai ni, fanga i um ni ngei chu a hung tlung tah, chu chu an lungin- zîngna ni nîng a tih."
Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.,"Ruol chu ring naw unla, ṭhuoitua chun ringna innghat naw ro; i âng- sûnga umnu kuom ngeia khawm chun i bau kawtkhârhai chu vêng ṭha rawh."
"For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.","Naupa chun pa hming a suksiet a, naunu chun a nu a do a, moin a tarpi a do sih a; mihriem hmêlmahai chu ama sûnghai ngei an nih."
"But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.",Kei ruok chun chu LALPA en ka ta; ka sandamna Pathien chu nghâk ka tih; ka Pathien chun a mi ngai ding a nih.
"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.","Aw ka hmêlma, mi diriem el naw rawh, ka tlûk pha khawm tho nâwk ka tih; inthima ka ṭhung khawmin LALPA chu ka ta dinga var nîng a tih."
"I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.","LALPA chunga chun thil ka suksuol ta leiin, a lungninawna nasa- tak chu phur ka tih, ka chungthu a mi hrilpui a, ka ta dinga rorêlna chu a muolsuo hmakhat chun: vara chun mi ṭhuoi suok a ta, a felna chu hmûng ka tih."
"Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see my desire upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.","Chuongchun, ka hmêlma ka kuoma, “Khâwlai am LALPA i Pathien?” titu chun hmûng a ta, muolphonain ama chu inkhum a tih. Ka mithai hin ama chu en a ta; tuhin chu kawthlêr chirhak anga sirde ni tâng a tih."
A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.,I kul banghai siemna ni ding chu! chu nia chun thuruot chu hlatak chena suklien nîng a tih.
"In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.","Chu nia chun Assuria le Aigupta khawpuia inthawk dâm, Aigupta le Vadung tlung raka in- thawk dâm, tuisuoriet le tuisuoriet inkâra inthawk le, tlâng le tlâng inkâra inthawk dâm chun, i kuomah hung an tih."
"Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.",Chuong sa khawm chun ram chu a sûnga chênghai le a thilthaw ra lei chun râusan nîng a tih.
"Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.","Karmel tlâng kâra khawsâwt- taka um i rochan berâm ruol, I mihai chu i hembâwk hmangin châwm la, inhma ang khan Basan le Gileada châwmin um tâwl raw hai se,"
As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.,Aigupta rama inthawka i fe suok lai ang khan a kuomah thil maktakhai inentir ka tih.
The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.,"Hnam tinin chu chu hmûng an ta, an thilthawtheina po po chu inzâpui an tih; an hmûr hup an ta, an nahai sêt a tih."
"They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.",Rûl angin pilvut liek an ta; hnuoia bawkinvâka fehai angin an umna kuoa inthawk chu inthin pumin hung an ta; LALPA ei Pathien kuoma chun ṭi pumin hung an tih; nangma leiin an ṭi ding a nih.
"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.","Nang anga khawhlona ngai- damtu le a rochan la um sun bawsietna fekhêltu Pathien tu am an um a? A lunginsenna chu kumkhuoin a vawng zing nawh, lunginsietnaa chun a lâwm êm êm hlak leiin."
He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.,"Ngha kîr nâwk a ta, ei chungah lunginsietna nei a tih; ei khaw- hlonahai chu a ke hnuoiah sirdêng a tih; nangin an suolnahai po po chu tuisuoriet mawng inthûktakhaia chun pei lût i tih."
"Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.","Tienlaia kan puhai kuoma ṭawng i lo inkhâm tah, Jakob kuoma thutak le Abraham kuoma lungin- sietna sukpuitling i tih."
