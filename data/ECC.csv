"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.","Jerusalema lal, David naupa Thuhriltu thuhai chu:"
"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.","“Teplohai teplo, Thuhriltu chun, teplohai teplo! Thil po po hi teplo a nih,” a ta."
What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?,"Miin a sininrimna, nisa hnuoia a sininrimna po poa chun ieng am hlâwkna a hmu a?"
"One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.","Suon khat a fe liem a, suon dang a hung suok a; Leihnuoi ruok hi chu a um ngaiin a um zing a."
"The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.","Nisa chu a hung suok a, nisa chu a tla nâwk a, A hung suokna hmun ma chu a tlung nâwk vak a."
"The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.","Thli chu simtieng a hrâng a, hmartieng a kîr nâwk a. A vêl a vêlin thli chu a hrâng a, Chu thli chu a fe kuolnaa bawk chun a kîr nâwk a."
"All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.","Vadunghai po po chu tuisuorietah an luong lût a, Anachu tuisuoriet chu a sip nawh a: Vadunghai chu an hung suokna hmun tiengah, chutieng ma chun an kîr nâwk a."
"All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.","Thil po po hi inrimna el a nih; miin a hril thei nawh; A hmua hmuin mit chu a tlai ngai nawh a, A hrieta hrietin na khawm chu a sip ngai bawk nawh."
That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.,"Thil ni tasa kha, thil la hung ni ding chu a na; Thaw tasa kha la thaw ding chu a nih: Nisa hnuoia hin thil tharlâm hrim a um nawh."
"Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.","Miin, “En ta, hi hi a thar a nih” an ti ding thil hrim a um am a nih? Einihai hmaa lo um ta dai ruok an nih;"
"There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after.","Hi hma thilhai hriet zingna a um nawh a, La hung um ding thilhai khawm chu Suon hung um dinghai laia tukhawmin hre zing chuong naw nih."
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.,Kei Thuhriltu hi Jerusalema Israelhai chunga lal ka ni tah a.
And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.,Vânkhuphnuoia thil thawa um ta po po chungthu chu varnaa zawnga zawng suok dingin ka lungril ka lo hmang tah a; Pathienin mihriem nauhai buoipui dinga a pêk chu sin rinumtak a nih.
"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.","Nisa hnuoia sin thawa um tahai po po chu ka hmu tah a; chun, ngai ta, thil po po chu teplo el, lungril sâwlna el a nih."
That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.,"A kâwi ta hlak chu siem tlûn thei a ni nawh a, Chun, a um naw hlak tiem el thei a ni hliek nawh a."
"I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.","Ka lungrilin, “Ka hmaa Jerusa- lema umhai po po nêkin varna ka nei nasa lem a nih, ka lungril khawmin hrietthiemna le varna nasatak a nei a,” ka tih a."
"And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.","Chun, intlâwkna le invêtna hre dingin le, varna chu hre dingin ka lungril ka sêng a; hi khawm hi nuom- hmanglo el a niin ka hriet tah a."
For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.,Varna tamtak umnaa chun lungngaina tamtak a um veh a; Hrietna insukpungtu khawm chun lungngaina ân sukpung bawk a nih.
Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.,"Tho thihai chun rim inhnik siemtu hriek chu rim thu an innamsuoktir a. Chuong ang bawk chun, invêtna chite chun varna le inzâkaina chu a suksietpêk."
A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.,"Mi var lung chu a changtieng pangah a ngha a, Mi invêt lung chu vawitieng a ngha."
"Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.","Anih, mi invêt chu lampuia a fe laiin, A hrietthiemna chun ân hlawsamtir a; Mi tin kuoma chun invêt a ni chu a hril hlak."
"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.","Rorêltu lungril chu i chungah a tho chun, I umna hmun chu mâksan naw la; Intuklûtna hin lungninawna nasatak chu a sukrê sih a."
"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:",Thil ṭha naw nisa hnuoia hin ka hmu chu a um a; Rorêltua inthawk thil indik lo suok ang tak chu;
"folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.","Invêt chu insâng nasataka siein a um a, Hausa chu hmun inhnuoia a ṭhung si hai hi."
"I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.","Siehlawhai chu sakawr chunga chuonga, Lal nauhai chu hnuoia kea lâwn ka hmuh a."
"He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.","Khur chotu chu chutaka chun tlâng a ta, Dâi nêrâwngtu chu rûlin chuk bawk a tih."
Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.,"Lung keilûttu chu suknatin um a ta, Thing chêkkhawitu chu chutak- a chun sukṭitin um a tih."
"If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.","Thîr chu a mâwla, miin a sîr chu a tâtngei naw chun, Hrâtna tam lem a hmang a ṭûl a; Nisienlakhawm, hlawtlingna ding chun varna a ṭhangkai."
"If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.","Dâwivêt a ni hmaa rûl chun a chuk si chun, Rûl dâwivêttu ta ding chun ṭhangkaina a um dêr nawh."
The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.,"Mi var baua thuhai chu a zainêm hlak a, Mi invêt hmûrhai ruok chun ama chu lem a tih."
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.,"A baua inthawka thu hung inṭanna khawm chu invêtna a na, A thuhril tâwpna khawm chu intlâwkna pawitâwk thei a nih."
"A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?","Mi invêt khawma thuhai a sukpung a, Mihriem chun ieng am a um ding a hriet nawh, Ama hnunga chun ieng am a um ding ti tuin am ama chu hril thei a ta?"
The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.,"Invêt sininrimna chun ama chu a suklungzîng a, Khawpuia fe dân khawm a hriet si nawh a."
"Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!","Aw ram, i chung a rik! i lal chu naupang a na, I rorêltuhaiin zîngkâr ruoi an ṭhe hlak si a."
"Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!","Aw ram, i lal chu mi ṭhahai naupa a na, I rorêltuhai chun inruina ding el ni loa, hrâtna dinga A hunbi taka an fâk lai chun i va hlim de!"
By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.,"Zawmthâwtnaa chun inchung chu a chim a, Thabona kuthaia chun in a far."
"A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.","Ruoiṭhena chu innuina dinga siem a na, Uoin chun nun chu a suk- lâwm a; Tangka ruok chun iengkim a thaw thei."
"Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.","Lal chu ṭawngsie inphur naw rawh, ngaituona khawmin; I khum pindana chun mi hausa chu ṭawngsie inphur bawk naw rawh; Chunga vate chun râwl rî chu phur a ta, Chuong thla neihai chun thu chu hril rawi an tih."
Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.,"Tuihai chunga chun i bei chu pei la, Ni tamtak hnunga chun i hmu nâwk ding a ni sih a."
"Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.","Chan chu hmun sariah sem lem la, anih, hmun rieta khawm; Hnuoi chunga hin thil ṭha naw ieng am a hung ding ti i hriet si nawh a."
"If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.","Sûmhai chu ruoa an sip hle chun hnuoi chungah an insukruok hlak a, Thing hi chu hmârtienga manih, simtienga manih a tlu chun, A tlûkna hmuna chun thing chu um a tih."
He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.,"Thli nghâktu chun thlaichi thlâk naw nih a, Sûmhai pawisatu chun sîk ngai bawk naw nih."
"As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all.","Thli lampui chu khâwtieng am ti i hriet naw angin le, nau vawntu phîng sûnga chun iengtin am ruhai chu an inṭhanga ti i hriet naw angin, thil po po thawtu Pathien sinthaw chu i hriet nawh."
"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.","Zingkâr chun i thlaichi chu thlâk la, zântienga khawm i kut chu la kîr naw rawh; a ieng lem am a hung hlawtling ding, a hi am a nih a kha am a nih, an pahni ve vein angkhat an ni ding am khawm i hriet si nawh a."
"Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.","Var chu ân hawi a, mithai ta dinga thil inhawi chu nisa hmu hi a nih."
"Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.","Anih, mi chu kum tamtak a dam chun, chuonga po po chun ama chu hlim raw se; amiruokchu, inthim lai nihai chu hre zing raw se, tamtak an ni ding a ni sih a. Chuong a hung tlunghai po po chu teplo el a nih."
"Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.","Aw tlangvâl, i tlangvâlnaa chun hlim rawh; i vânglai nihaia chun i lungril chu hlim sienla, i lungril lampui chu hraw la, i mithmu ngeia chun; amiruokchu, hieng thil po poa ding hin Pathien chun rorêlnaah a ṭhuoilût ding che a nih ti hre rawh."
"Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.","Chuleiin, i lungrila inthawkin lungngaina chu sie hmang la, i tisaa inthawk chun thil ṭha naw chu sie hmang bawk la, tlangvâl lai le vânglai nihai hi teplo el a ni sih a."
"Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;","I vânglai nihaia chun nangma Siemtu che chu hre zing la, kumhai a hung hnai a, ni ṭha nawhai a hung tlung hma le;"
"before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;","chu huna chun, “Annia chun inhawitina ka nei nawh,” i tina hun a hung tlung hma hin; nisa amanih, var amanih, thla amanih, arasihai amanih an inthim hmain, sûmhai chu ruo hnunga an hung ki nâwk hma hin."
"in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,","In vêngtuhai chu an inthin a, mi hrâthai chu an kûn a, bu râwttuhai chu an tlâwm leia an maa, tukvera dâkhai chu an inthim nia chun;"
"and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;","kawtthlêrahai chun kawtkhâr- hai khâr a na, thil râwt rihai chu a hung dei a, mi chu vate râwl ria chun a hung tho a, thil ri mawi naunu- hmeihai po po chu sukhnuoi an hung na;"
"yea, they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors shall be in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:","anni chun ân sâng chu an ṭih a, lampuia chun ṭitna a hung um a, almond thing chu a hung kumûm a, khâuṭhikṭhihai chu buoipuium an hung ni a, nuom zâwng dâm chun a hung hlawsam a, mi chu a chatuon ina chun a fe ta leiin le, lusûnhai chun kawtthlêrhai chu an fang leiin le;"
"before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,","tangkaraw hrui chu suktan a ni leiin le, rângkachak maihûn amanih, tuibêl kekuol chu a tliekin amanih; Pil bêl amani chu tuikhura chun sukkawi a ni leiin amanih,"
"and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.",pilvut chu a nina anga hnuoia a kîr nâwk hmain le thlarau chu ama petu Pathien kuoma a kîr nâwk hmain.
"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.","“Teplohai teplo,” Thuhriltu chun a tih, thil po po hi teplo a nih."
"And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.","Chu bâka chun, Thuhriltu hi a var leiin, mihai chu hrietthiemna ân chûktir hlak a, anih, a ngaituoh a, a zawngsuok a, thuvar tamtakhai chu indawt peiin a sieh a."
"The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, even words of truth.","Thuhriltu chun thu pawmtlâk- hai chu hmu suok dingin a zawng a, chuong zieka umhai chu thu ngîl, thudik thuhai chu an nih."
"The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened are the words of the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.","Mi var thuhai chu hmawl a hmawra thilzum um ang a na, chun, Berâm vêngtu pakhata inthawka pêk thuvar lâk khâwmhai chu thîrkil vuok det tlat ang chu a nih."
"And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.","Chun, chu bâka chun, ka naupa, infuiin um la, lekhabu tamtak siem hin tâwp lêm a nei nawh a; inchûk tam khawm hi taksa inrimna chau a nih."
"This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.","Hi hi thil tâwp chu a nih; thil po po chu hriet a ni tah a; Pathien ṭî la, a thupêkhai chu zâwm rawh; hi hi mi- hriem thilthaw ding pumpui chu a nih."
"For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.","Pathien chun sin tinrêng chu rorêlnaah a hung lâk lût ding a ni sih a, thil inthuphai po po le, a ṭha khawm a ṭha naw khawm chu."
"I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.","Ka lungrilin, “Khaw he, hlim hlapna chu infieng ka tih, inhawi chênin,” kân tih a; hi khawm hi teplo el bawk a nih."
"I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?","Innui ngawt el chu “Invêtna”, a nih a, Nunkhuo phâm hlak ienga ṭhangkai a ni nawh ti ka hriet suok tah a."
"I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.","Ka lungril chun ka tisa chu uoina sukhlim ka tum a, varna chu ka lungrila zawng pei zingin, invêtna chu chel tlatin, vân hnuoia an dam sûng tawitea mihriem nauhai thaw dinga ṭha chu ieng am a ni ti ka hmu thei rawi mawh tiin;"
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;,"Sin ropuitakhai kân siempêk a, inhai kân bâwlpêk a, grep huonhai kân phunpêk a,"
"I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;","huonhai le lênghmunhai kân siempêk a, chuonga chun theira chi po pohai ka phun a;"
"I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;",thinghai phunna ramhnuoi chu tuia buokna dingin tuidîlhai kân siempêk a;
"I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;","siehlawpahai, siehlawnuhai kân châwk a, ka ina siehlaw pieng hrimhai dâm ka nei bawk a; ka hmaa Jerusalema lo um tahai po po nêk khan berâm ruol le bâwng ruol khawm ka nei nasa lem a."
"I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.","Rângkachak le tangka kân khâwlpêk a, rambung le lalhai ro thil bîkhai dâm le chun. Pasal hlasaktu le nuhmei hlasaktuhai, mihriem nau- hai lâwm zâwng ang, thaikêm khawm tamtak ka nei a."
"So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.","Chuongchun, ka ropui hlein, Jerusalema keia hmaa umhai po po nêk khan ka nasa lem a; ka varna hlak chu ka kuomah a um zing bawk a."
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.,"Chun, ka mithaiin a châk taphawthai chu, chuonga inthawk chun kân sûm nawh a, hlimna ienga inthawk khawmin ka lungril chu kân sûm ngai nawh a, ka sininrimna po poa chun ka lungril chu a hlim a; ka sininrimna po poah hi hi ka chanpuol a nih."
"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.","Chun, ka kuthaiin sin a lo thaw ta po po chu ka en a, chuonghai thawa ka lo sininrimna tahai po po chu teplo el le, lungril rimsikna el a nih, nisa hnuoia hin hlâwkna hrim a lo um nawh ti ka hmuh a."
"And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been done long ago.","Chun,invêtna le intlâwkna le varna chu hmu dingin kân her a; mi lal hung thlâktu khawm chun ieng am a thaw thei chuong a? a hmaapa thaw tasa bawk chau chu a nih."
"Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.","Chun, varin inthimna chu a khûm angin, varna khawm chun invêtna chu a khûm ti ka hmu tah a."
"The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.","Mi var mithai chu a lua chun a um a, mi invêt ruok chu inthimah a lâwn; amiruokchu, an rênga chungah khawrêl angkhat a tlung tho ti ka hmuh a."
"Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.","Chun, ka lungrila chun, “Mi invêt chunga thil tlung ang bawk chu ka chunga khawm a tlung ve ding a na; chuong a ni chun ieng dinga var bîk hle am ka nih a?” kân tih a. Ka lungril ma chun, “Hi khawm hi teplo el a nih” ka tih a."
"For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!",Mi invêt ang thoin mi var khawm chu kum khuoa hriet zingna um naw nih. Mi invêt ang bawka mi var khawm chu a thi ngei dingzie chu aw!
"So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.","Chuleiin, nisa hnuoia sin thawa um chu ka ta dinga a lungzingthlâk leiin, nun hi ka chim a nih; thil po po chu teplo el, lungril rimsikna el a ni sih a."
"And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.","Chuongchun, mi keia hnunga la hung um ding ta dingin ka mâksan el ding a ni ti ka hmuin nisa hnuoia ka sininrim, chu ka sin thawinrimna po po chu ka theida a nih."
"And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.","Chun, mi invêt a ni ding le mi var a ni ding tuin am hrieng a ta? Nisa hnuoia ka varna hmanga ka sininrimna po po ra neitu a la ni ding a ni si a. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih."
Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.,"Chuleichun, nisa hnuoia ka sininrimna, chu sininrimna po po chungthua chun ka lungril chu ka sukbeidawng dêr tah a."
"For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.","Achâng chun mi varna, hriet- thiemna le themthiemna le sinin- rimna, ana hlak, a thaw suoksa chu sininrim nawin a chên el dinga maksanpêk a um bawk a. Hi khawm hi teplo el a na, suol nasatak a nih."
"For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?","Miin a sininrimna po po le a lungril rimsikna, nisa hnuoia a rim- siknaa chun ieng am a hmu a?"
"For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.","A nihai po po chu nat tuornaa sip a nih a, a sininrimna hlak lung- zîngna ruok a nih a; anih, zâna chen khawm a lungril chun châwl hrim a hmu nawh. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih."
"There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.","Miin a sinthaw inrimnaah a lungril a sininrimna a dâwn a, a fâk nêka ṭha lem, mi ta dingin ieng dang khawm a um nawh. Hi khawm hi ka hmu tah a, Pathien kuta inthawk bawk a nih."
"For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?","Keia nêka nasain tuin am inhawitir theiin, tuin am fa thei a ta?"
"For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.","Pathien chun ama suklung- awitu kuoma chun varna le hriet- thiem theina le hlimna a pêk a, mi suol kuoma ruok chun Pathien suk- lungawitu kuoma pêk dinga lâk- khâwmna le siekhâwlna sin a pêk a. Hi khawm hi teplo el a na, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
"For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:","Vân hnuoia hin thiltum tinrêng ta dingin hun a um a, thil tinrêng ta dingin hunbi a um:"
"a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;","Pieng hun a um a, thi hun a um a; Phun hun a um a, phunsahai phâwi hun a um bawk a;"
"a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;","Sukhlum hun le sukdam hun a um a, Ṭhiek hun le bâwl hun a um a;"
"a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;","Ṭap hun le innui hun a um a, Sûnna hun le lâm hun a um a;"
"a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;","Lung peihâwn hun le lung lâk khâwm hun a um a, Pawm hun le pawmnaa inthawk insûm hun a um a;"
"a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;","Zawng hun le inhmang hun a um a, Vawng hun le peihâwn hun a um a;"
"a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;","Keithlêr hun le ṭhui hun a um a, To ṭawk ṭawk hun le thu hril hun a um a;"
"a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.","Hmangai hun le theida hun a um a, Indo hun le inrem hun a um a;"
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?,Sinthawtu chun a sininrimnaah ieng hlâwkna am a hmu a?
I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.,Chutaka an buoipui ngei ding mihriem nauhai kuoma chun Pathien chun sin dinga a pêk chu ka hmuh a.
"He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.","Thil tinrêng chu mâni hun senga mawi dingin a siem a; a bula inthawka a tâwp chena Pathienin sin a thaw chu mihriemin a hriet suok thei nawna dingin, an lungrilah khawvêl chu a ruotdet bawk a."
"I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.",An dam sûng poa thil ṭha thawa hlima um nêka an ta dinga ṭha lem iengkhawm a um nawh ti ka hriet a.
"And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.","Chun, mi tinin a sinthaw inrim- na po poa thil ṭha a chêna, a dâwna a fâk chu Pathien thilthlâwnpêk a nih."
"I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.","Pathienin a thaw taphawt kum- khuoa ding a nih ti ka hriet a; chu- taka chun iengkhawm belsa thei ni naw ni a, iengkhawm lâkṭhe thei ni naw nih; Ama hmaa mihriemhai chu an ṭit theina dingin Pathien chun a thaw tah a nih."
That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.,"Thil hung umhai chu um ta hnung dai kha a na, la hung ding khawm chu ni ta hnung dai kha a nih: thil fe liem ta hnung kha Pathien chun a hung lâk kîr nâwk pei a nih."
"And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.","Chu nawa khawm chun nisa hnuoia hin, rorêlna umnaa chun, rîtlona khawm a um a; felna umna hmuna chun rîtlona khawm a um ka hmuh a."
"I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.","Ka lungril chun, “Pathien chun mi fel le rilo chunga chun ro rêl a tih; sin tinrêng le thiltum tinrênga dingin hun a um sih a,” ka tih a."
"I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.","Ka lungril ma chun, “Mihriem nauhai lei a ni hi; Pathien chun anni chu a fie theina ding le, anni khawma ramsahai ang chau an nih ti an hrietsuok theina dingin,” ka tih a."
"For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.","Chu thil mihriem nauhai chunga tlung chu ramsahai chunga khawm a tlung sih a; pakhat a thi angin a dang khawm chu an thih a. Thuok angkhat nei seng an nih a, mihriem chun ramsahai nêka chung- hnungbîkna a nei nawh; thil po po chu teplo el a ni sih a."
"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.","An rêngin hmun pakhatah an feh a; an rêngin pilvuta inthawk an na, an rêngin pilvut an inchang nâwk a."
"Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?",Mihriem thlarau chu chung- tieng a feh a; ramsa thlarau chu hnuoitieng hnuoiah a fe ti tuin am a hriet a?
"Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?","Chuleiin, miin a sinthawhaia a hlim nêka ṭha lem iengkhawm ka hmu nawh; chu chu ama chanpuol a na, ama hnunga thil hung um dinghai chu hmu dingin tuin am ama chu hung ṭhuoi kîr tâng a ti leh?"
"Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.","Chun, ka thlîr a, nisa hnuoia nêksâwrna thawa umhai po po chu ka hmuh a; chun, nêksâwra umhai mitthlihai chu ka hmu bawk a; thlamuontu hrim an nei nawh; nêk- sâwrtuhai tienga chun thilthaw- theina a um a, nisienlakhawm, anni chun thlamuontu hrim an nei nawh."
Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;,"Chuleiin, mi hring la dam zing- hai nêk hmanin, mi thi, thi ta hnung- hai chu vângnei lemah ka ngai tah a;"
"yea, better than them both did I esteem him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.","anih, chuhai ve ve nêk chun, nisa hnuoia thawa um sin rilo la hmulo le, la um ngailo ni chu a ṭha lem a nih."
"Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.","Chun, mi chu a tuolbâwmin a thîkna hlak san, sinthaw hlawtling le sininrimna tinrênghai po po chu ka hmuh a. Hi khawm hi teplo el, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
"The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.","Mi invêt chun a kuthai a kuoh a, ama tisa ngei chu a fâk a."
"Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.","Lungril rimsikna le sinrimnaa kut sip hni nêkin, dei zawta kut sip khat chu a ṭha lem."
Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.,"Chun, ka thlîr nâwk a, nisa hnuoia chun teplo el chu ka hmuh a."
"There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.","Mi pakhat naupasal amanih, unaupa amanih khawm pakhat khawm nei lo a um a; ana hlak chu, a sininrimna po po chun tâwp hrim a nei nawh a, a mithai chu hausaknaa chun a tlai ngai bawk nawh a. “Tu ta ding taka hienga mâni inhawitirna chân raka sininrim am ka ni lie?” khawm a ti ngai nawh. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih; anih, tuorna natak a ni chau a nih."
"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.","Pakhat nêk chun pahni chu an ṭha lem a, an sininrimnaa chun lâwmman ṭhatak an hmu leiin."
"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.","An tlu chun, a pakhat chun a ruolpa chu a keitho ding a ni sih a; makhâta um ruok chu a chung a rik, a tlûk lai khawma ama keithotu ding khawm nei lo chu."
"Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?",Chunawa khawm mi pahni zâl hmunkhat chu an insuklum a; pakhat chau ruok chu iengtin am insuklum a ta?
"And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.","Mi makhâta um chu hne el thei ni sien khawm, pahni chun lo dodâl thei an tih. Hruol zai thum neia siem chu awlrawnga suktan a ni ngai nawh."
"Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.","Lal tar invêt, thurâwn khawm pawm nachâng hre ta lo nêk chun tleirâwl var le rimsi khawm chu a ṭha lem,"
"For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.","lungina inthawka lal ni dinga hung suok amanih, a lalram sûng ngeia mi rimsia pieng hrim khawm ni sien."
"I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.",Nisa hnuoia mi hring inzi nuoi nuoi po po chu lal aia la hung ngîr ding tleirâwl zui ruokin ka hmuh a.
"There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.","Mi an chunga a umnahai po po chu hriet sêng ruol an ni nawh a, amiruokchu, ama hnunga hunghai chu amaa chun hlim chuong naw ni hai. Matheiloin hi khawm hi teplo el a na, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.,"Pathien ina i fe pha chun i ke vêng ṭha rawh, invêthai inthâwina inhlân nêk chun ngai dinga va hnai chu a ṭha lem sih a; thil ṭha naw an thaw ti an hriet si nawh a."
"Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.","I bauin ti rawk rawk naw la, Pathien hmaa thil iengkhawm hril dingin inhmaw naw rawh; Pathien chu vânah a um a, nang chu hnuoia um i ni sih a; chuleiin, i thu chu suktlâwm rawh."
"For a dream cometh with a multitude of business, and a fool’s voice with a multitude of words.",Mang chu sin tamtak leh a hung hlak sih a; mi invêt râwl chu thu tamtak leh a hung bawk a.
"When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest.","Pathien kuoma ṭawng în khâm pha chun hlen dingin muongchâng naw, mi invêta chun lâwmna a nei si nawh a, în khâmna chu hlen el rawh."
"Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.","În khâma i hlen si naw nêk chun, în khâm naw law law kha a ṭha lem."
"Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?","I tisa chu suksuoltir dingin i bau chu phal naw la; Pathien mitirhai hmaa chun ân dik naw a nih, ti bawk naw rawh; ieng dingin am Pathien chu i râwla chun lunginsenin i kut sinthawhai chu a sukbohmang el ding chu?"
"For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear thou God.","Mang tamtak le, thu tamtakhaia chun teplo tamtak a um a; nang ruok chun Pathien ṭi rawh."
"If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there are higher than they.","Mi rimsi chu nêksâwra a um a, rambunga thawluina chun rorêlna le indikna chu lâk hmang i hmu chun, chu thila chun makti naw rawh, hotu insâng chu a nêka insâng lem chun a enthlit zing sih a, anni nêka insâng lem khawm chu an la um pei a nih."
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.,"Chu nawa khawm leihnuoi hlâwkna chu mi tin ta ding a na, lal khawm chu lohma ring mi tho a nih."
"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.",Tangka ngainatu chu tangkaah lungawi naw nih a; hausakna ngai- natu khawm hlâwknaa chun lungawi bawk naw nih: hi khawm hi teplo el a nih.
"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding of them with his eyes?","Thilhai chu an hung pung chun, a fatuhai khawm an hung pung pei a nih; chutaka chun a neitu ta ding chun, a mithaia a hmu chau ti naw chu ieng am ṭhangkaina a um chuong leh?"
"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.","Mi sinthaw inrim îmu chu ân hnik a, fa tamin fa tlâwm sien khawm; amiruokchu, hausa chu a hausakna chun inintir phal naw nih."
"There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt:","Nisa hnuoia thil ṭha naw lung- zingthlâktak ka hmu a um a; chu chu, hausaknahai a neituin ama le ama insuknatna ding chaua a kawl hi a nih;"
"and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.","chuong hausaknahai chu tuor- na khawhloah an bohmang a; nau- pasal a nei a, anachu a kuta chun iengkhawm a um nawh."
"As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.","A nu phîng sûnga inthawka a hung suok ang khan, a ruok bawkin fê nawk a ta, a sininrimna man, a kuta a chawi thei khawm chu ieng- khawm fêpui naw nih."
"And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind?","Chun, hi khawm hi thil ṭha naw lungzingum tak chu a nih, a hung dân ang kawng tinrênga chun; chuong ang bawkin fêng a ta; a lungril sukrim saka a sininrimnaa chun ieng am hlâwkna a hmu leh?"
"All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore vexed, and hath sickness and wrath.","A dam sûng po po chun inthim hnuoiah a fâk a, a lunginsen êm êm a, natna le lunginsenna a nei a."
"Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, wherein he laboreth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion.","Ngai ta u, mi ta dinga ditum le ṭha âwma ka hmu chu, Pathienin ama a ipêk a dam sûng po poa, nisa hnuoia a sininrimna, a sininrimna po poa chun thil ṭha chu chên a, dâwna fâk hi a nih; chu chu ama chanpuol a ni sih a."
"Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God.","Mi tin Pathienin hausakna le neinungna a pêk a, chutaka fâk theina a pêk a, a sininrimnaa chun hlimna a pêk bawk a; hi hi Pathien thilthlâwnpêk a nih."
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.,A dam sûng nihai po po chu hre zing nâwk si naw nih a; Pathien chun a lung lâwm zâwnga ama chu a dawn tâk leiin.
"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:","Nisa hnuoia hin thil suol ka hmu chu a um a, mihriemhai chunga chun a rik hle a;"
"a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.","Pathienin mi neinungna le hau- sakna le inzâumna a pêk a, chuong- chun, a lungrilin a dit zâwng taphawt chu tlâksam hrim a nei nawh a; amiruokchu, Pathien chun chuonghai fâk theina a pêk tlat nawh a, ami- ruokchu, mikhuol chun a fâk ta lem a; hi khawm hi teplo el a na, natna ṭha lo a nih."
"If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:","Miin nau za nei sienla, kum tamtak dam sienla, a kum nihai chu tam hle sienla, amiruokchu, a lungril chu thil ṭhain a tlai nawh a; chu nawa khawm phûmna a hlaw bawk si naw chun, ama nêk chun a hun nawh a pieng khawm chu a ṭha lem a nih ka ti a nih;"
"for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;","teploah a hung a, inthima chun a fê hmang a, a hming chu inthimnain ân khum a:"
moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath rest rather than the other:,"chu nawa chun nisa chu a hmu ngai nawh a, hriet khawm a hriet nawh a; hi hin mi dang nêk hmanin châwlna a nei lem a nih."
"yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good, do not all go to one place?","Anih, kum sâng vawi hni dam sienla, thil ṭha a chang chuong naw chun, mi po po thuhmun vawng an ni naw am a nih?"
"All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.","Mihriem sininrimna po po chu a bau ta ding a na, amiruokchu, phîng- ṭâmna chu suksip a ni chuong nawh."
"For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living?","Mi var chun mi invêt nêkin ieng am hlâwkna a hmu chuong leh? Annawleh, mi hringhai hmaa fê dân hrie mi rimsi chun ieng am a nei a?"
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.,"Nuom zâwng ram tin nei nêk chun mithaia hmu chu a ṭha lem a; hi khawm hi teplo el, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
"Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.","Ieng po khawm lo um ta kha a hming sâwttaka sak tah a nih a; chun, mihriem chu ieng am a na ti khawm hriet a ni sa tah a, ama nêka thilthawthei lem chu a khing zo nawh;"
"Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?","Thu a tam po leh teplo a tam pei a, mihriem ta dingin iem a ṭhat lemna?"
"For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?","A dam sûnga dingin tuin am mihriem ta dinga thil ṭha chu a hriet a, a dam sûng teplo nihai po po chu hlim angin a hmangral el a ni naw maw? Nisa hnuoia hin ama hnungah ieng am a hung um ding tuin am mi a hril thei a?"
"A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of one’s birth.",Hming ṭhat chu hriek hlutak nêkin a ṭha lem a; Mi a thi ni chu a pieng ni nêkin a ṭha lem bawk.
It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.,"Ruoiṭhena ina fe nêkin, lusûnna ina fe chu a ṭha lem; Chu chu mi po po tâwpna a ni sih a: Mi dam chun a lungrilah sie tlat a tih."
Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.,"Innuina nêk chun lungngaina a ṭha lem a, Hmêl lungngaina chun lungril a siemṭha sih a."
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.,Mi var lungril chu lusûn inah a um a; Mi invêt lungril ruok chu hlim hlapna inah a um.
"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.","Mi invêthai hlasak ngai nêk chun, Mi var kâwkna ngaithlâk a ṭha lem."
"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.","Bêl suong hnuoia hlinghai puok ṭak ṭak ang hi, Mi invêt innuina khawm chu a nih; Hi khawm hi teplo el a nih."
Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.,"Matheilovin, nêksâwrna chun mi var chu a sukvêt a, Thamna chun lungril a suksiet."
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.,Thil chu a ṭanna nêkin a tâwp chu a ṭha lem a; Lungrila zaidawthei mi chu lungrila chapo nêkin a ṭha lem.
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.,"Lunginsen dingin i lungrilah inhmaw naw rawh, Lunginsenna chu mi invêthai ângsûnga um a ni sih a."
"Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.","“Tulai hun nêk hin tienlai nihai kha ieng ieng leia ṭha lem am a nih a?” ti naw rawh, Chu thil în dawnna chu varnaa inthawk a ni si nawh a."
"Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.","Varna hi rochan ang bawka ṭha a na, Anih, nisa hmutuhai ta ding lem chun a ṭha nasa zuol a nih."
"For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.",Tangka chu inhliekhuna a ni ang bawkin varna khawm chu inhliekhuna a na; Hrietna ṭhatna chu: varna neitu hringna chu a vawng himpêk a nih.
"Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?",Pathien sinthaw chu ngaituo ta; A kâwia a siem ta chu tuin am suktlûn thei a ta?
"In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything that shall be after him.","Hlawtling nia chun hlim la, vângduoi nia chun ngaituo rawh; miin ama hnunga ding iengkhawm a hriet nawna dingin Pathien chun pakhat chu a dang ang bawkin a siem a nih."
"All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing.",Ka teplo nihaia chun hi po hi ka hmu tah a; mi fel ama felnaa thi bohmang chu a um a; mi rilo a thil suol thaw pum zinga dam sâwt hrep chu a um bawk a.
Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?,"Intifel talaw naw la, insukvar talaw bawk naw rawh; iengdingin am nang le nang insukbohmang i ta?"
"Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?","Rilo talaw naw la, invêt talaw bawk naw rawh; i hun tlung hmain iengdingin am thîng i ta?"
"It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.","Hi hi i chel tlat hi a ṭha a nih, chutaka inthawk chun i kut khawm la kîr naw rawh; Pathien ṭîtuhai chun an la hung suoksan vawng ding a ni sih a."
Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.,Varna chu mi var ta ding chun khawpuia rorêltu sâwm umhai nêk chun hrâtna a ni lem.
"Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.","Indiktakin, hnuoi chunga hin mi fel thil ṭha thaw a, thil suksuol ngailo an um nawh."
"Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;","Chun, mi thuhril nazawng ngaisak naw rawh, chuong naw chun, i siehlawin ṭawngsie ân phur che hre rawi i tih;"
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.,nang ngei khawma chuong ang bawk chun mi danghai ṭawngsie în phur rawp hlak ti i lungrilin i hriet rawp sih a.
"All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.","Hi po po hi varnaa chun ka lo fie tah a, “Var tâng ka tih,” ka ta; amiruokchu, keimaa inthawk chun hlatak a nih."
"That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?",Chuong a hlata hla le nasataka inthûk chu tuin am hmu suok thei a ta?
"I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.","Ka ngha kîr a, ka lungril chun, hre ding le, zawng ding le, varna zawng suok dingin le; rîtlona hi invêtna a nih ti hre ding le, invêtna chu intlâwkna a nih ti hre dingin ka thlîr vêl a."
"And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.","Chun, nuhmei a lungril chu chânghai le lênhai, a kuthai chu hnâng ang el neitu chu, thina nêka ṭha lem ka hmu suok a; tukhawm Pathien suklâwmtu chu amaa inthawk suok thleng an ta, amiruokchu, mi suol chu amanu chun man a tih."
"Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, laying one thing to another, to find out the account;","Thuhriltu chun, Ngai ta, hi hi ka hmu suok tah, a nizât hmu suok dinga thil pakhat zoa a dang la um pei hi;"
"which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.","chu chu ka lungril hin a zawng zing a, nisienlakhawm, ka la hmu suok nawh a; pasal pakhat sâng khat laia chu ka hmu suok a; amiruokchu, chuonghai lai po poa nuhmei pakhat chu ka hmu suok zo nawh."
"Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.","Ngai ta, hi chau hi ka hmu suok a, Pathien chun mi chu mi ngîl ni dingin a siem a, amiruokchu, anni chu mâni nuom dân dânin an khawsa ta lem a."
"Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.",Mi var ang hi tu am a um a? Thil umze hrie tu am a um a? Mi a varna chun a hmêl chu a sukvar a. A hmêl inrumna khawm chu a danglam tah.
"I counsel thee, Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.","Thu ka râwn che; Lal thupêk chu pawisa rawh, Pathiena în khâmna lei chun."
Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.,"A hmaihmaa inthawk fe suok inhmaw naw la, thil suol khawm thaw zing naw rawh; a nuom zâwng taphawthai chu a thaw si a."
"For the king’s word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?","Lal thu chun thilthawtheina a nei leiin, tuin am a kuomah, “Ieng am i thaw a” ti thei a ta?"
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment:,Tukhawm thupêkhai pawmtu chun thil ṭha naw tuok naw nih; mi var lungril chun hun indik le a kawnglam a hriet.
for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:,Thil tinrênghai chun hun le kawnglam an nei si a; mihriem buoina chu a chungah nasa hle sien khawm.
for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?,"Thil la hung tlung ding chu a hriet si nawh a, a la hung ni dân ding chu tuin am hril thei a ti leh?"
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.,"Thlarau chu chel dingin, thlarau chunga thuneina nei mihriem an um nawh; thi ni chunga khawm chun thuneina an nei bawk nawh; chun, indonaa chun châwl a um bawk nawh; chu chu kuoma pêka um ta chu rîtlona chun ama rîtlona chu sansuok naw nih."
"All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.",Hi po po hi ka hmu tah a; nisa hnuoia sin po pohaia chun ka lungril chu ka hmang tah a; mi pakhatin mi dang chungah ama le ama ân suknatna ding elin thuneina a nei hun chu a nei a nih.
"So I saw the wicked buried, and they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.","Chun, mi rilo chu phûma a um ka hmuh a, thlâna chun an hung a; chuong thil thaw diktuhai chu hmun inthienga inthawk chun an fê hmang a, khawpuia chun anni chu theinghil an ni tah a; hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih."
"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.","Sin ṭha naw chunga thu rêl thlûk chu inrangtaka suksuok a ni ngai nawh a, chuleichun, mihriemhai naupasalhai chun thil suol thaw dingin an lungril chun a tin rân hlak a nih."
"Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:","Mi suol chun thil ṭha naw vawi za thawin a dam sûng nihai chu suksei tho sien khawm; matheiloin, Pathien ṭituhai ta ding chun, ama hmaa an ṭi leiin, a ṭha ding a nih ti ka hriet a;"
"but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.","amiruokchu, mi rilo ta ding chun ṭha naw nih a, a dam sûng ni- hai khawm chu suksei pha naw bawk a tih; chu chu hlim ang el hi a na; Pathien hmaa chun a ṭî naw leiin."
"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.","Hnuoi chunga hin thil teplo thaw tah a um a; mi fel chu an um a, an kuoma khawm chun mi rilohaiin an thaw ang angin a tlung a nih; chun, mi rilohai an um bawk a, an kuoma khawm chun mi felhai sin- thaw ang ang chun a tlung ve bawk a nih. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih ka tih."
"Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.","Chun, miin hlima uma, fâka dâwn nêka nisa hnuoia hin thil ṭha lem a nei naw leiin, nuomsipna hi ṭha ka ti el a nih; nisa hnuoia Pathienin ama a lo pêk tah a dam sûng nihaia po po chun a sininrimna chu a kuoma chun a um ding a ni sih a."
"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),","Hnuoi chunga sin thawa um- hai chu hmu ding le, varna chu hre dinga ka lungril ka hmang lai chu: (sûna manih zâna mani khawma mithaiin îmu a hmu nawzie dâm chu);"
"then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.","nisa hnuoia sin thawa um, mi- hriemhaiin an hmu suok thei naw, Pathien sinthaw chu ka hmuh a; ieng ang khawmin, miin zawngin nasatak- in thaw inrim sien khawm, hmu suok chuong naw nih; mi var khawma hriet inring sien khawm hmu suok chuong bawk naw nih."
"For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.","Hi po po hi hmu suok dingin ka lungrila chun kân vawi tlat a, mi fel le mi var le an sinthawhai chu Pathien kutah a um a; an hmaa um chu ngainatum a ni le theidaum a ni tukhawmin an hriet nawh."
"All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.","Thil po po chu mi po po chungah angkhatin a hung tlung vawng a; mi fel le mi rilo chunga thil tlung khawm thuhmun a nih, mi ṭha le mi suol, mi inthieng le mi inthieng naw chung- a khawm; inthâwi hlak le inthâwi ngailo mi chunga khawm; mi ṭha chunga ang bawkin mi suol chunga khawm a nih, inkhâmtu chunga ang bawkin inkhâmna ṭitu chunga khawm chun."
"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.","Nisa hnuoia thawa um po po lai hi hi thil suol a nih: mi po po chunga thiltlung hmunkhat vawng a ni hi; anih, mihriem nauhai lungril chu thil ṭha nawa sip a na, an dam lai chun an lungrila chun invêtna a um a, chu hnung hlak chun mithi kuomah an fê tah a."
For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.,Mi hring rama la um ta ding chun beiseina a um a; sakeibaknei thi nêk chun ui hring chu a ṭha lem.
"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.","Mi hring chun an la thi ding a nih ti an inhriet sih a; mi thi ruok chun iengkhawm an hriet nawh, lâwmna iengkhawm an nei ta naw bawk a, anni chu hriet zing an ni ta bawk nawh."
"As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.","An ngainat zâwng dâm, an theida zâwng dâm, an inhnar zâwng dâm chu a bohmang vawng tah a; nisa hnuoia thil thawa um tinrêng- haia chun kumkhuoin chan ding hrim an nei nawh."
"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.","Fe la, i bei chu hlimin fa la, i uoin chu lungril hlimin dâwn rawh; Pa- thien chun i sinthawhai chu a pawm ta sih a."
Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack oil.,"I silfênhai chu vâr zing zing sien- la, i lu khawm chu sahriek intlâksam- tir naw rawh."
"Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun.",Nisa hnuoia a pêk che i teplo dam sûng nihai po poah nuhmei i hmangai le chun hlimtakin um rawh; chu chu nisa hnuoia i sininrimnaa le i dam sûnga i chan a nih.
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.","I kutin sinthaw ding a hmu phawt chu i theitâwpin thaw la, i fêna ding thlâna chun varna amanih, hrietthiemna amanih, hlêmna ama- nih, sinthawna amanih a um ta si nawh a."
"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.","Ka thlîr nâwk a, nisa hnuoia chun intlânsiekna chu a hrâthai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, indona chu a hrâthai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, bei chu mi varhai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, hausakna chu hrietthiem- na nei mihai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, ditsakna chu themthiemhai ta ding chau a ni nawh; amiruokchu, hun le remchâng chu an rênga kuomah a tlung seng a ni lem ti ka hmu a."
"For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.","Mihriem chun a hun chu a hrietthiem nawh a; ngahai chu lên ṭiuma mana an um ang le, vatehai chu chânga an âwk angin chuong ang bawk chun, an chunga a hung tlung thut pha chun mihriem nauhai khawm chu hun ṭha nawa chun âwkin an um hlak a nih."
"I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me:","Hieng ang kawng bawka hin nisa hnuoia chun varna chu a hmu a, ka ta ding chun ropuitakin ân lang a."
"There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.","Khawpui chitê, a sûnga mi tlâwmte um a um a; lal ropuitakin a hung rûn tah a, ân huol a, kul ropui- tak a bâwl khum a."
"Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.","Chun, a sûnga chun mi var pasetak hi a um a, a varna chun khawpui chu a sansuok tah a; ami- ruokchu, chu mi pasetak chu tu- khawma an hriet zing nawh a."
"Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.","Chun, kei chun, “Hrâtna nêkin varna hi a ṭha lem a ni hi, mi pase- tak varna chu hmusit niin, a thuhai chu ngaisak ni naw sien khawm,” ka tih a."
The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.,Mi var thu damtereka hril khawm chu invêthai laia rorêltu khêk nêk chun hriet a ni lem a.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good.,"Varna chu indona thuomhnaw- hai nêkin a ṭha lem a; amiruokchu, mi suol pakhat khawma nasatakin a suksiet a nih."
