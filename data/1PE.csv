"according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.","awi ding le Isu Krista thisen the dawng dinga Thlarau isuktum, Pa Pathien ihriet lâwk anga thlanghai kuoma chun: In chungah lunginsietna le inrem- na sukpungin um raw se."
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa chu inpâkin um raw se. Ama chun, a lunginsietna nasatak angin, mithi laia inthawka Isu Krista thonâwkna leiin beiseina hring hmu dingin nauvin a mi nei nâwk a,"
"unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,","rochan se thei naw, inthieng nawna kai naw, chuoi thei naw, vâna in ta dinga a ikhêk chu hmu dingin."
who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.,"Sandamna, hun nuhnunga in- lang dinga inzosa chu hmu dingin, ringna leia Pathien thilthawtheinaa vêng chu in nih."
"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,","Chutaka chun nasatakin in hlim a nih, tuhin, (a ṭûl chun) thlêmna tinrêng leiin lungngai hri unla khawm;"
"that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:","in ringna fiena, rângkachak meia fie hnung khawma bohmang hlak nêka hlu lem chu, Isu Krista inlâr pha chun inpâkna le chawimawina le ropuina ding a hung ni theina dingin."
"whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:","Ama chu hmu ngai naw khawmin in hmangai a, ama chu tuhin hmu naw unla khawm, in awi a, lâwm hril thei ruol lo le ropuitakin in hlim bêk bêk hlak;"
"receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.","in ring san, in thlarau sandamna chu hmuin."
"Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:","Lunginsietna, nangni ta ding ngei lo hrillâwktu zâwlneihai chun, hi sandamna hi zawngin an lo sui ngun hlak a;"
"searching what time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.","Krista Thlarau annia um chun, Krista tuor dinghai le chu hnunga ropuina hung um ding ân hriet- lâwktir lai khan, ieng hun âm, ieng ang takin am a hung tlung ding ti an lo sui ngun hlak a nih."
"To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.","Chuong thu chun mani rawng inbâwl loin, nangni rawng an bâwl lem ti an kuomah inhriettir a ni tah. Chuong thu chu vâna inthawka tirsuok Thlarau Inthieng ṭhangpuiin, Chanchin Ṭha hriltu cheu khan tuhin an hril cheu a, chuong thil chu vântirkohaiin bi an nuom hlak a nih."
"Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;","Chuleiin, in lungril dier keiin, ngaiven unla, Isu Krista inlâr pha chun lunginsietna a hung chawipêk ding cheu chu beidawng loin beisei tlat ro;"
"as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance:","nau tiawihai angin, in hriet naw laia in tienlai châknahai anga um loin;"
"but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;","a kotu cheu chu ân thieng angin, nangni khawm in chângzie po poah lo inthieng lem ta ro;"
"because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.","“Nangni in inthieng ding a nih, kei kân thieng sih a,” ti ziek ang khan."
"And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:","Chun, mi tin thlier bik nei loa, sinthaw ang peia ngaituo hlaktu chu Pa anga in lam chun hitaka in châm sûng po chu ṭi dêkin um ro."
"knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;","In thlatuhai ipêk sâwng, in um dân ieng ni barloa inthawk chu, thil se thei, tangka le rângkachaka intlan in ni nawh a,"
"but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, even the blood of Christ:","berâmte hmêlhem lo le inthieng nawna kai lo thisen anga, Krista thisen hlu chun intlan in ni lem ti in hriet sih a."
"who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake,","Ama chu leilung insieng hmain ruot lâwkin a um ngei el, nisien- lakhawm, hun nuhnunga hin nangni leiin suklangin a um;"
"who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.","ama leiin mithi laia inthawka a keithotu le a ropuina petu Pathien ringtuhai in na, in ringna le in beisei- na chu Pathiena a um theina dingin."
"Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:","Unauhai hmangai taktak ding- in, thutak zâwma in thlarau in suk- thieng ta leiin lungrila ṭhahnem- ngaitakin inhmangai tuo ro."
"having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.","Chi se theia inthawkin ni loin, Pathien thu hring zing le um zinga chun, chi se thei nawa inthawka pieng thar in ni sih a."
"For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:","“Mi po po hlohna ang an nih, An ropuina po po khawm Hlo pâr ang a nih. Hlo chu a vuoi a, A pâr chu a tla a,"
But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.,"Lalpa thu ruok chu, Chatuonin a um zing a nih,” ti a ni sih a. Chu chu a nih, Chanchin Ṭha thu an hril cheu kha."
"Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,","Chuongchun, suolna po po dâm, zâwrna po po dâm, vervêkna dâm, îtthîkna dâm, hrilsietna po po bânsan unla,"
"as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;","naute pieng tharhai angin thla- rau tieng nênetui iengkhawm pawl lo chu châk ro, chutaka chun sandamna tling khawpa in inṭhang lien theina dingin."
if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:,Lalpa chu mi lunginsiet theitak a nih ti in hriet ta sih a.
"unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,","Ama chu lung hring, mihriemhai dit naw ngei, Pathien ngaia ruok chun thlang le hlutak a nih,"
"ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.","ama kuoma chun hungin, nangni khawm lung hringhai angin thlarau tieng ina remin in um, Isu Krista zâra Pathien lâwm zâwng thlarau tieng inthâwina inhlân dinga, thiempu inthienghai in hung nina dingin."
"Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.","Chuleiin, Pathien Lekha Thua chun, “Ngai ta u, Ziona chun a kia lung pawimaw tak, thlang le hlutak ka rem a nih, Ama ringtu chu muolpho naw ni,” ti a chuong a nih."
"For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner;","Chuongchun, nangni a awihai ta ding chun hlutak a nih, a awi nawhai ta ding ruok chun, “In bâwltuhaiin lung an dit naw kha, Chu ngei chu a kia lung ṭangkai tak a lo ni tah,"
"and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.","“Tlûkna lung le dangna lungpui leh,” Thu chu an awi naw leiin an tlu sih a, chuong anga um dinga ruot an ni hrim bawk a."
"But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:","Nisienlakhawm, inthima in- thawka suok a, a var nasataka lût dinga kotu cheu ṭhatna chu in inentir theina dingin, nangni chu chi thlang, lal thiempuhai, hnam inthieng, Pathien mihai ngei in ni sih a."
"who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.","Inhma khan mi hrim in ni nawh a, tuhin chu Pathien mi in ni tah a; inhma khan zângaina in hmu nawh a, tuhin chu zângaina in hmu tah a."
"Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;","Dittakhai, mikhuol le khuolfe in ni leiin, thlarau do hlaktu tisa châknahai bânsan dingin ka ngên cheu."
"having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.","Jentailhai lai in chângzie chu mawitak ni raw se; chuongchun, thil suksuoltuhai anga an hrilsiet cheu kawngah in thil thaw ṭhat an hmuhai leiin a hung kan nia chun Pathien chawimawi thei an tih."
"Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;","Lalpa leiin mihriem ruothai taphawt kuomah intuklût ro, chung- hnunga um laltak kuoma manih,"
"or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.","thil suksuoltuhai chunga phuba la ding le, thil sukṭhatuhai inpâk dinga ama itir sâwng Bawrsâp kuoma khawm."
"For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:","Hi hi Pathien dit zawng a ni si, mi invêthai thu hril var naw chu thil ṭha thawa in sêldawng hi;"
"as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.","zalên in nih, nisienlakhawm, in zalênna chu suol inkhumna dinga hmang loin, Pathien suoka umna dingin hmang lem ro."
Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.,"Mi po po chawimawi ro. Unau- hai chu hmangai ro, Pathien ṭidêk ro. Laltak chu chawimawi ro."
"Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.","Siehlawhai, ṭi dêkin in hotuhai thu thuin um ro; mi ṭha le mi nuninnêmhai kâwla chau ni loin, mi nunsehai kâwla khawm."
"For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.","Miin Pathien hrietna leiin tuor naw ding ding tuorin lungngaina a tuor hrâm hrâm chun, chu chu Pathien lâwm zâwng a ni sih a."
"For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted for it, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.","In suol a, kutthlâk in tuorin, seltakin tuor unla khawm inpâk ieng am in hlaw leh? Nisienlakhawm, thil in thaw ṭhaa in tuorin, seltaka in tuor chun, chu chu Pathien lâwm zâwng a nih."
"For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:",Krista khawm khan a tuorpêk cheu leiin hieng ang hi thaw dinga ko in nih in sawnnaw; a kehnunga in zuina dingin enkhi ding a mâksan pêk cheu kha.
"who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:","Ama chun thil hrim a suksuol nawh a, a bauah zâwrna hrim a um bawk nawh."
"who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:","Mi hala a um laiin a hal ve thung nawh a, a tuor laiin a vau nawh a, feltaka ngaituo hlaktu kuoma chun ân pêk lem a nih."
"who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.","Suol tiengahai thi tain felna tienga ei hring theina dingin, ama ngeiin a taksain thinga khan ei suolhai a phur a, ama vuokna invuol- hai chun sukdamin in um tah a."
For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.,"Berâm inhmang anga in in- hmang kha, tu ruok hin chu in thlarau vêngtu le, Hotu kuoma chun in kîr nâwk ta hi."
"In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;","Chuong ang bawkin nangni nuhmeihai, mâni pasalhai thu thuin um ro; chuongchun, anni laia tûkhawmin thu chu awi naw sien khawm, thu ni loin, an nuhmeihai chângziea hnein um thei an tih,"
beholding your chaste behavior coupled with fear.,in chângze inthieng le inzaumtak an hmu pha chun.
"Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;","In incheina chu puotieng in- cheina sam phier dâm, rângkachak ṭhi hli dâm, silfêna inthuom dâm chu ni loin,"
"but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.","lungrila mihriem thupa um, lungril thuhnuoirawl le nuninnêm silfên se thei loa inthuom ni lem raw se, chu chu Pathien mithmu chun a hlu bêk bêk a nih."
"For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:","Chuong ang bawkin, inhmaa nuhmei inthieng Pathien ringtuhai khawm kha mâni pasalhai thu thua umin an inchei hlak sih a."
"as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.","Sarain Abraham chu, “Lalpa,” tiin a thu a awi ang khan, thil ṭha thawin, ṭitna ding hrim nei loa in um chun, Sara nauhai nîng in tih."
"Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.","Nangni pasalhai, chuong ang bawkin, nuhmei hi bêl kawi awl lem an ni lei le, lunginsietna hringna chu changpuitu an ni hre zingin, chawi- mawi pumin in nuhmeihai kuomah um ro, in ṭawngṭainahai hluoa a um nâwna dingin."
"Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:","A tâwp taka chun, in rêngin lung- ril hmunkhatin um unla, inlainat tuo unla, unau angin inhmangai unla, lunginsietna nei unla, thuhnuoi- rawlin um ro."
"not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.","Suol suolin thung naw unla, halna halna bawkin thung naw ro; malsâwm hlau lem ro. Hi hi lei hin ko in ni si, malsâwmna chang dingin."
"For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:","“Hringna hmangai nuom le, Ni ṭhahai hmu nuom chun, Suola inthawkin a lei vêng ṭha sienla, A hmûr khawm zâwrna thu hril naw dingin, Vêng ṭha raw se."
"And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.","Suol nghatsanin, Thil ṭha thaw raw se; Inremna zawngin, Hnawt pei raw se."
"For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.","Lalpa mit chu mi felhai chungah a fuh a, A na khawm an ṭawngṭaina tieng a sit hlak sih a, Amiruokchu, Lalpa hmêl chu, Thil suksuoltuhai chungah a um hlak,” ti a ni sih a."
"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?",Thil ṭha tienga ṭhahnem in ngai chun in pawi tâwk ding tu am um an ta?
"But even if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;","Nisienlakhawm, felna leia lo tuor ta dâm in ni chun, hamṭhâng in tih. An ṭitumna chu ṭi naw unla, lunginzîng bawk naw ro."
"but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:","Amiruokchu, in lungrilah Krista chu Lalah ruot ro; nangnia um in beiseina san chu ân dawn taphawt cheu chu dawn dingin inzosa rawp ro."
"having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, thuhnuoirawl- tak le ṭi dêk pumin, sie le ṭha hrietna inthiengtak nei unla, chuongchun, an hrilsietna cheu kawnga chun, Kristaa in um dân ṭhatak hrilsetuhai chu sukmuolphoin um thei an tih."
"For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.","Thil suol thaw leia tuor nêk chun, Pathien remti zâwng a ni chun thil ṭha thaw leia tuor hi a ṭha lem sih a."
"Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;","Pathien kuoma a mi ṭhuoi theina dingin Krista chun suolhai leiin vawikhat a tuor bawk sih a, mi fel chun mi fel naw aiin a tuor a, tisaa sukhlumin a um a, thlaraua ruok chun sukhringin a um tah."
"in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,","Chu chun, intângna ina thlarau umhai kuoma chun thu a zu khêk- pui a."
"that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:","Chuonghai chun, inhmaa Noa dam laia lawng siem sûng poa, Pathien dâwtheinain a nghâk lai khan an awi nawh a; chu lawnga chun, mi tlâwmtê (chu chu pariet tina a nih) tuia inthawka sandamin an um tah."
"which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;","Chu angpui Baptisma chun, Isu Krista thonâwkna leiin tuhin a sandam cheu a nih. (Chu chu tisa inthieng naw sukfai el ni loin, sie le ṭha hrietna inthienga Pathien lamna hi a ni lem)."
"who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.","Isu Krista chu vâna fein, Pathien chang tieng a um a, vântir- kohai dâm, thuneina dâm, thilthaw- theina dâm, ama thu thua inumtirin a um."
"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;","Chuongchun, Kristain tisaa a tuor leiin nangni khawm, chuong ang lungrilin inthuom ve ro; tisaa tuor ta chun suol a bânsan ta sih a."
"that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.","Chuongchun, hi hnunga tisaa in la um sûng po chu mihriem châk- nahai tienga um ta loin, Pathien dit zâwng tieng um tâng in tih."
"For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries:","Jentailhai dit zâwng thâwna ding le, hurnaa dâm, taksa châknaa dâm, uoin hênaa dâm, zu hmun hlimnaa dâm, zu dâwn khâwmnaa dâm, milim biekna tirdakumtaka dâma umna ding chun kha hma kha a huntâwk tah."
"wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:","Chuonga chun anni inhawitir taluo anga in um ve ta naw hi mak an ta, an hrilsiet hlak cheu a nih."
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.,"Anni chun, mi hring le mithihai ngaituo dinga inzosa kuoma chun an chanchin la hril an tih."
"For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.","Hi hi lei hin a nih, mithihai lai khawm chun Chanchin Ṭha hril a ni, tisaa um mihriemhai anga ngaituoin an um a, thlaraua ruok chun Pathien anga an hring theina dingin."
"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer:","Nisienlakhawm, thil po po tâwpna chu a hnai tah a, chuleiin, in ṭawngṭai theina dingin lungril feltak putin fimkhur ro."
above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins:,"Iengkim nêkin, ṭhahnemngai- takin inhmangai tuo lem ro; hma- ngaina chun suol tamtak ân khum hlak sih a."
using hospitality one to another without murmuring:,"Chier loin intlung tuo unla,"
"according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;","mi tinin, Pathien lunginsietna tinrêng enkawltu ṭha angin, Pathien thilpêk an dawnghai taphawt chu hmangin rawng inbâwl tuo seng ro."
"if any man speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God; if any man ministereth, ministering as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.","Mi tûkhawmin thu a hril chun Pathien thuhai angin hril raw se; mi tûkhawmin rawng a bâwl chun Pathienin hrâtna a pêk ang peiin bâwl raw se; chuongchun, Isu Krista leiin Pathien chu thil iengkimah chawimawiin um thei a tih, ropuina le rorêlna chu chatuona ama ta a ni sih a. Amen."
"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you:","Dittakhai, nangni laia fiena nasatak hung um, nangni fiena dinga in chunga hung tlung hi, thil mak in chunga tlung angin makti naw ro."
"but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.","Krista tuornahaia tuorpuituhai in ni zie ang peiin lâwm lem ro; chuongchun, a ropuina a hung inlang pha chun nangni khawm hlimtakin lâwm thei in tih."
"If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.",Krista hming leia hal in ni chun in hamṭha; ropuina Thlarau le Pathien Thlarau chu in chungah a um sih a.
"For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men’s matters:","Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia tûkhawm tuolthattu a ni leiin ama- nih, inru a ni leiin amanih, thil suksuoltu a ni leiin amanih, mi danghai thilthaw rêlpêktu a ni leiin amanih tuor naw raw se."
"but if a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.","Amiruokchu, kristien a ni leiin tuor sienla, inzak naw raw se; chu hming lei chun Pathien chawimawi lem raw se."
"For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?","Rorêlna chu Pathien sûnghaia hin ṭan a hun ta sih a; chun, einia hman a phut hmasa chun Pathien Chanchin Ṭha thu zâwm nawhai tâwpna chu ieng tin tak am nîng a ta?"
"And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?","Chun, mi fel hman sandam hrâm hrâm a ni chun, Pathien ngai- sak naw le mi suol chu khâwlai am inlang phâk hlak an ta?"
Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.,"Chuleiin, Pathien remti zâwng anga tuorhai chun, thil ṭha thawin an thlarauhai chu Siemtu ringumtak kuomah inkawltir raw hai se."
"The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:","Chuongchun, nangni laia kohran upahai chu, kei, in upatpui, Krista tuornahai hretu, ropuina hung inlang ding chang vetu ding hin kân fui cheu."
"Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;","Nangni laia Pathien Pâwlhai chu enkawl ro. Thaw ding a ni lei ni loin, Pathien thu anga inhâwk pum lemin, hlêpna tirdakum dit lei ni loin, lungrila inhâwktak lemin,"
"neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.","in chanhai chungah insuklal bawk loin, pâwlhai enkhi dingin insiem lemin inrawi ro."
"And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.","Chun, Berâm Vêngtu Laltak chu a hung inlang pha, ropuina lallu- khum chuoi thei naw chu hmûng in tih."
"Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni tleirâwl deuhai, upahai kuomah intuklût ro. Anih, in rêngin rawng inbâwltuo seng dingin thuhnuoirawl- nain inthuom ro; Pathienin chapohai a kal a, inngaitlâwmhai ruok chu lunginsietna a pêk hlak sih a."
"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;","Chuleiin, a huntaka chun a chawimawi theina ding cheuin, Pathien kut hrâttak hnuoia chun insukhnuoi unla,"
"casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.",amain a ngaisak hlak cheu leiin in lunginzîngna po po ama chungah innghat vawng ro.
"Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:","Ngaiven unla, fimkhur ro; in khingpui Diebol chu sakeibaknei inrûm hlak angin a fâk thei ding zawngin ân vêl ruoi hlak a nih."
"whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.","In unau khawvêla umhai chunga chun chuong anga tuorna chu a tlung ve a nih ti hrein, awi dettaka umin, ama chu do ro."
"And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.","Chun, lunginsietna po po Pathien, a chatuon ropuina chang dinga Kristaa kotu cheu chun, sâwt nawtê in tuor hnungin siemṭha famkimin, sukdetin, sukhrât a ti cheu."
To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.,Ama kuoma chun rorêlna chu chatuonin um raw se. Amen.
"By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein.","Ka unaupa ringumtaka ka iruot Silvan kuta hin, nangni infui le, chu chu Pathien lunginsietna tak tak a nih ti inhriettirin, tawitêin in kuomah ka ziek a nih; chuonga chun ngîr det ro."
"She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.","Babulona um, nangni anga thlangnu hin chibai a bûk cheu; chuong ang bawkin ka naupa Marka khawmin chibai a bûk cheu."
Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.,Hmangaina fâwpa fâwpin chi- bai inbûk ro. Nangni laia Kristaa um taphawt kuoma chun inremna um raw se.
