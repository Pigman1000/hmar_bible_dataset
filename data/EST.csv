"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),","Ahasuer hun lai chun hieng hi a hung na, (hi Ahasuer hi Indiaa inthawka Ethiopia chena, rambung za sâwmhni pasari chunga rorêltu a nih),"
"that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,","chuong nihaia, lal Ahasuer chu Susa khawpuia, a lalram lalṭhung- phaa a ṭhung laiin,"
"in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;","a rorêl a kum thumnaa chun a mi ṭhahai le a siehlawhai po po ta dingin ruoi a ṭheh a; Media le Persia ram thilthawtheihai, mi ṭhahai le lal nau- hai, chu rambunga mihai chu a hmaa chun an um a;"
"when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.","chu huna chun ama chun a lal- ram ropuitak hausaknahai le ân lal- zie inzaûmna chu ni tamtak el, ni za khat le sâwmriet sûng zet ân entir a."
"And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.","Chun, chuong nihai chu a hung tlungkim chun, lal in huon sûng tuollaia chun, ni sari sûng zet, lal in Susaa um mi lien le mi chinhai po po kuoma chun lal chun ruoi a ṭhe tah a;"
"There were hangings of white cloth, of green, and of blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.","puon a vâr, a dum le dumpâwl chu sailungvâr banhaia tangkaruo suonkuola puon zai inhmi a êma khitdea khâiin a um a; sailungvâr sen le a dumpâwl le a vâr le a dum phêk chungah, rângkachak le tangkaruo ṭhungphahai chu rem an nih a."
"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.","Anni chu rângkachak nohaiin dâwn ding chu an pêk a, (chuong rângkachak nohai chu a danglam seng an nih), lal kut ang pei chun, lal uoin chu tam tâwk zetin an pêk bawk a."
"And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.","Chun, dâwn dân khawm chu dân ang takin a na; tukhawma an thawlui thei nawh a; lal chun mi tinin mâni nuom tâwk ang senga an thawna dingin a ina manmihai chu mi po po ta dinga vêngtu dingin a ruot a."
Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.,Lalnu Vasti khawm chun nuhmeihai ta bîk dingin lal Ahasuer lal ina chun ruoi a ṭheh a.
"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,","Ni sari niha, uoin leia lal lungril chu a hung hlim hle phing chun, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar le Karkas, lal Ahasuer hmaa rawngbâwl hlakhai, mi tillâk pasari chu,"
"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.","lalnu Vasti chu lallukhum khuma lal hmaa chun hung ṭhuoia, mi ṭhahai le mipuihai chu a hmêl ṭhatzie chu inentir dingin thu a pêk tah a; hang en hin ama hlak chu a hmêl a ṭha hle el bawk sih a."
"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.","Nisienlakhawm, mi tillâkhai kuoma lal thupêk chu lalnu Vasti chun a sêl a, a hung nuom nawh a; chuleiin, lal chu a lunginsen ta êm êm el a, a lunginsen chu a chawk hin a chawk tah a."
"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment;","Chun, lal chun mi varhai, a hunhai hretuhai kuoma chun, (dân le rorêl dân hretuhai po po kuoma chun, hi hi lal thaw dân a ni hrim a:"
"and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),","ama dawta chun Media le Persia mi lien pasari, lal hmêl chu hmu hlak a, lalrama khawm chun a ṭhung hmasatuhai Karsena, Sethar, Admatha, Tarsis, Meres, Marsena le Memukan hai chu an nih.)"
"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?","“Lal Ahasuerin mi tillâkhai hmanga a thupêk hi lalnu Vasti hin a thaw ta naw lei hin dân angin ieng anga ei thaw ding am ning a ta,” a ta."
"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.","Chun, lalhai le lal hmaa chun Memukan chun a dawn a, “Lalnu Vasti hin lal chunga chau hin a suksuol a ni nawh a, amiruokchu, lal Ahasuer rambung po poa mipui po po le mi ṭhahai po po chunga khawm a suksuol a nih."
"For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.","‘Lal Ahasuer chun lalnu Vasti chu a hmaa hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a, ama hlak chu a hung si nawh a,’ tiin hril dar a ni pha chun, an pasalhai an mithmua entlêuna ding- in hi lalnu thilthaw hi nuhmei po po chun an hung chîng ve ngei ding a ni hi."
And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king’s princes. So will there arise much contempt and wrath.,"Chuongchun, vawisûna Media le Persia lalnauhai, lalnu thilthaw lo hretuhai chun lalpa mi ṭhahai kuoma chun chuong ang bawkin an ti ve ngei ding a na; chuleiin, inkhingna le lunginsenna nasatak a hung suok ngei ding a ni hi."
"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.","Lal hin ṭha a ti zâwng a ni chun lal kuoma inthawk hin lal thupêk chu suok sienla, ‘lal Ahasuer hmaa hin Vasti hi hung ta ngai hrim hrim naw raw se,’ tiin Media le Persia dân thleng nâwk ngai ta lohai ang chun ziek ni raw seh; chun, lal hin a lalnu nina hi ama nêka ṭha lem mi dang kuomah pe bawk raw se."
"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.","Chuongchun, lalin thupêk a siem ding chu a lalram po poa sukdar a ni pha chun (a lien âwm sih a) nuhmeihai po po chun, an pasal, mi lien le mi chînhai kuoma khawm chun inzâna an nei ta ding a nih,” tiin."
And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:,"Chu thuhril chun mi lienhai le lal chu a suklâwm a, lal chun Memu- kan thu ang tak chun a thaw tah a;"
"for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.","a rambung po poa chun lekha a thawn a, rambung tinah ziek ang tak le, mi chi tin kuomah an ṭawng ang ngei le, pasalin mâni insûng ro chu a phurna ding le, a mihai ṭawng ang ngeia a hrildar theina dingin."
"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.","Chun, lal Ahasuer chun ram le tuisuoriet thlierkârhai chunga chun leiman a siem a."
"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?","Chuongchun, a thilthawtheizie le a hrâtna thilthawhai po po le, Mordekai ropuizie chanchin famkim, lalin ama ân kaisângtir nasatzie chu Media le Persia lalhai chanchin ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
"For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.","A chipuihai laia chun thlamuong- na thu hrilin, a mihai ta ding thil ṭha zawngin, a unau mi tamtakhai ilâwm le Juda mihai laia ropuitak le lal Ahasuer dawttu, Juda mi Mordekai chu a ni sih a."
"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.","Hieng thilhai hnunga lal Ahasuer lunginsenna chu a hung rê hnunga chun, Vasti le a thilthaw le, a chunga thupêk um chu a hriet zing a."
"Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:","Chun, lal siehlaw ama rawng- bâwltu chun thurawt a siem a, “Lal ta ding hin nunghâk tleirawl hmêl ṭhahai zawng ni raw se."
"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;","Susa khawpuia nuhmeihai inah hieng nunghâk tleirawl hmêl ṭhahai po po hung ṭhuoi khâwm dingin lal hin a rambung sûng po poa dingin hotuhai ruot bawk sien. Anni chu nuhmeihai kawltu, lal mitillâk Hegai enkawlna hnuoiah sie ni hai sien; chun, incheimawina hmangruohai pêk ni bawk hai sien."
and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.,"Chun, nunghâk lal suklungâwitu chu Vasti aiah lalnu hung ni raw se,” tiin. Chu thil chun lal chu a suklâwm a, chuong ang tak chun a thaw tah a."
"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,","Susa khawpuia chun Juda mi, a hming Mordekai, Benjamin mi Kis naupa, Simei naupa, Jair naupa chu a um a;"
"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.",ama chu Juda lal Jehoiakin ruola Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin a ṭhuoi hmang sal intânghai ruola Jerusalema inthawka ṭhuoi hmang a ni veh a.
"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.","Ama chun a pami naunu Hadassa, chu chu Esther a nih, chu a châwmlien a, amanu chun nu ama- nih, pa amani khawm a nei si nawh a; chu nunghâk chu hmêl ṭha ditumtak a na; chuongchun, a nu le a pa an thi chun Mordekai chun ama naunu dingin a lâk a nih."
"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.","Chuongchun, lal thupêk le a thu sukthlûk chu hriet a na, nunghâk tamtakhai chu Susa khawpuia Hegai enkawlna hnuoia chun ṭhuoi khâwm an ni phing chun, nuhmei enkawltu Hegai enkawlna hnuoiah lal ina chun Esther khawm chu ṭhuoi a ni ve tah a."
"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.","Chu nunghâk chun ama chu a suklâwm a, a lungsietna chu a hlaw tah a; lal chun incheimawina hmang- ruohai le a fâk ding chanpuol chu lal ina mi nunghâk thlang suok pasari leh inhmawtakin a pêk a; nuhmeihai in hmun ṭhatna taka chun ama le a nunghâkhai chu a sie tah a."
Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.,Esther chun a chihai le a lai- bunghai khawm ân hriettir nawh a; Mordekai chun inhriettir lo dingin a khap sih a.
"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.","Chun, Esther chu ieng angin am a thawh a, ieng am a chang a ti hre dingin, nuhmei in tuol puoa chun Mordekai chu ni tin hin a fe hlak a."
"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),","Nunghâk chu lal Ahasuer kuom- a a lût hun a tlung hma chun nuhmei- hai ta dinga incheimawina hun ruot thla sâwmpahni a hmang zo ding a na, thla ruk sûng chu mura hriek leh, thla ruk dang chu riminhnik danghai leh."
then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: Whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.,"Chun, nunghâk chu lal kuoma a lût dân ding chu hieng ang hi a nih: lal ina va fe dinga nuhmeihai ina a dit zâwng taphawt chu chawi dinga pêk a na."
"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.","Zântieng chun chutaka chun fêng a ta, zingkâr chun nuhmeihai in pahnina, thaikêmhai enkawltu, lal mitillâk Saasgaz enkawlna hnuoia chun hung kîr a ta. Lal chu a chungah a lâwm nawh a, a hminga a ko naw chun lal kuoma chun a kîr nâwk ta ngainaw ding a nih."
"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.","Chuongchun, a naunu dinga ama enkawltu Mordekai pami Abi- hail naunu Esther ta dinga lal kuoma lût hun a hung tlung chun, ieng- khawm a ngên nawh a, nuhmeihai enkawltu, lal mitillâk Hegaiin a ruotpêkhai chau naw chu."
"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.","Chun, a hmu taphawthai mit- hmuah Esther chun ditsakna a hlawh a. Chuongchun, a rorêl kum sarina. Tebeth thla, thla sâwmnaa chun, a lal inah, lal Ahasuer kuoma chun Esther chu ṭhuoi lût a ni tah a."
"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.","Chuongchun, nuhmei danghai po po nêkin lal chun Esther chu a ditzâwng a, nunghâk po pohai nêk chun a mithmua chun lunginsietna le ditsak a hlaw nasa lem a; chuong- chun, a lua chun lallukhum ân khumtir a, Vasti aia chun lalnuah a siem tah a."
"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.","Chun, lal chun a lalhai le a siehlawhai po po ta dingin, ruoi ropuitak, Esther ruoiṭhe, chu a siem tah a, rambunghai ta dingin châwl a siem a, lal tiktlâina ang peiin lâwm- manhai khawm a pêk bawk a."
"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.","Nunghâkhai an hung inkhâwm a vawihninaa chun Mordekai chu lal kul kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a,"
"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.","Esther chun a sûnghai le a hnam khawm a la hrillang nawh a, Mordekai chun a khap leiin; ama a umpui lai ang bawk khan Esther chun Mordekai thu chu a awi sih a."
"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.","Chuong nihaia Mordekai chu lal in kawtkhâra a ṭhung lai chun, mi tillâk pahni, Bigthan le Teres, kawt- khâr vêngtuhai chu an lunginsen a, lal Ahasuer chunga kut thlâkna ding an zawng a."
"And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.","Chu thil chu Mordekai chun a lo hriet a, ama chun lalnu Esther kuoma chun ân hriettir a; chuong- chun, Esther chun Mordekaia hming chun lal chu a hril tah a."
"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.","Chuonga chu thu chu dâwp- suokna siem a hung ni chun, chuong ang ngei chu a ni ti hmusuok a ni tah a, anni chu thinga khai hlum an ni ve ve tah a; chun, lal hmaa chun lal chanchin ziekna bua chun ziek a ni nghe ngheh a."
"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.","Hieng thil hnunga hin lal Aha- suer chun Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Haman chu ân kaisângtir a, ama chu a siesâng a, a ṭhunghmun chu ama ruolpui milienhai po po chunga chun a sieh a."
"And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.","Chuongchun, lal siehlaw, lal kul kawtkhâra um hlakhai po po chun Haman chu chibai an bûk a, an inza êm êm hlak a; ama chungthua chun lal chun chuong ang ding chun thu a pêk hrim a ni sih a. Amiruokchu, Mordekai chun chibai a bûk nawh a, ama chu inzâ khawm ân zâ bawk nawh a."
"Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?","Chuongchun, lal siehlaw, lal kul kawtkhâra umhai chun Mordekai kuoma chun, “Iengdinga lal thupêk i bawsiet am a na?” an ta."
"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.","Ni tinin ama chu an hril a, anni chu a ngai naw phing chun hieng hi a hung na, Haman kuoma chun Morde- kai chungthu chu a ngaimaw le maw naw hrietna dingin an hril a, ama chun Juda mi a ni ti anni a lo hril ta sih a."
"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.","Chun, Hamanin Mordekai chun ama chu chibai a bûk nawh a, inza khawm ân za nawh ti a hriet chun, Haman chu a lunginsen ta êm êm el a."
"But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun Mordekai chung chaua kut thlâk chu inzâpuiumah a ngai a; Mordekai chipuihai ngei chu ama an lo inhriettir ta sih a; chuongchun, Haman chun Ahasuer ramawp sûng po poa, Juda mihai po po, Mordekai chipuihai ngei chu sukbohmangna ding a zawng tah a."
"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.","Lal Ahasuer inlal kum sâwm pahnina, thla khatna, Nisan thlaa chun, ni tin tin le thla tin tin hin, thla sâwm pahnina, Adar thla chen chun Haman hmaa chun Pur, chu chu aisân a nih, an sân hlak a."
"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.","Chun, Haman chun lal Ahasuer kuoma chun, “I ram sûng rambung po poa mihai laia indara umdar chi khat an um a nih; an dânhai chu mi dang- hai dân hrim hrima inthawkin a danglam bîk rieu a, lal dânhai khawm hi an zâwm chuong bawk nawh a; chuleiin, anni ngaithei zing hi lal ta dinga ṭhathnemna a ni nawh."
"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.","Lal remti zâwng a ni chun, anni chu sukbohmang ding an nih tia ziek hi ni el raw se; chun, keiin lal sum inhaia an hung sie dingin lal sin- thawnaa enkawltuhai kuta chun tangka talent sîng khat pêng ka tih,” a ta."
"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.","Chun, lal chun a kuta kutsebi chu a lâk a, Judahai hmêlma, Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Haman kuoma chun a pêk tah a."
"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.","Chun, lal chun Haman kuoma chun, “Nangin an chunga ṭha i ti ang anga thaw dingin mihai le tangka khawm chu i kuoma pêk a nih,” a ta."
"Then were the king’s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.","Chun, thla khatna, ni sâwmpa- thum ni chun lal lekhaziektuhai chu ko an ni tah a, chi tinhai lalhai kuoma le, rambung tina rorêltuhai kuoma le, lal ram awptuhai kuoma chun Hamanin thu a pêk ang taphawt chun lekha chu ziek a ni tah a, rambung tinah chutaka inziek ang tak le, chi tin kuomah an ṭawng ang ngeiin; lal Ahasuer hminga ziek a na, lal kutsebi ngeia namdet a ni bawk a."
"And letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.","Adar thla, thla sâwmpahnina, ni sâwmpathum ni ngeia, ni khat sûnga, Juda mi po po, naupang le upa, nuhmei le, naupangtehai khawm, sukchimit vawng ding le, sukhlum ding le sukbohmang vawng ding le annia inthawka râllâk sum chu lâk el dingin, lal rambung po poa chun lekhahai chu dâka thawn a ni tah a."
"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.","Lekhaziek chu thupêk rambung tina thawn dar ding chu, chu ni ngeia an lo inzosa hieu theina dingin mi po pohai kuoma chun sutsuok a ni tah a."
"The posts went forth in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.","Lekhathawn phurnahai chu lal thupêkin inhmâwtakin a fe suok tah a; chun, thupêk chu Susa khawpuia inthawka siem a ni bawk a: chun, lal le Haman chu zu dâwn dingin an ṭhung a, Susa khawpui sûng ruok chu buoi namênin a buoi nawh a."
"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;","Mordekaiin chuong thil thawa umhai po po a hriet chun, Morde- kai chun a puonhai a keithlêr a, vut laia saiip puon silin, khawpui kawt- thlêra chun a fe suok a, râwl inring- taka khêkin, lungsetakin a ṭap a;"
and he came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.,"lal kul kawtkhâr hmaa ngei khawm chun a hung a, saiip puon silin tukhawm lal kul kawtkhâr chu an lût thei ngai naw hrim a na."
"And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.","Chun, rambung tin elah, lal thupêk le a thu sukthlûk a tlungna taphawta chun, Judahai laia chun lungngaina nasatak el le bungheina dâm le, ṭapna le inrûmna dâm chu a um tah a; tamtak lem chu saiip puon silin pilvut chungah an zâl a."
"And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.","Esther nunghâkhai le a vêng- tuhai chu a kuomah an hung a, ama chu an hril a; chuongchun, lalnu khawm chu nasatak elin a lungngai tah a; a saiip puon chu lâk hmangpêk a, Mordekai chu insiltir dingin silfên- hai a thawn a; nisienlakhawm, ama ruok chun a lo lâk nawh a."
"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.","Chun, Esther chun, lal vêngtu pakhat, amanu vêngtu dinga lalin a iruot Hathak chu a ko a, hi thil hi ieng am a na, ieng lei am a ni leh ti hre dingin Mordekai kuoma chun fe dingin a tir tah a."
"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s gate.","Chuongchun, Hathak chu lal kawtkhâr puoa khawpui khawlai- dunga chun Mordekai kuomah a va fe tah a."
"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.","Mordekai chun a chunga thil hung tlung po po le anni sukbo- hmangna dinga, Judahai ta dinga lal sum inhaia Hamanin sum pêk a tiem zât char chu a hril a."
"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.","Anni sukbohmang dinga Susaa inthawka thupêk pêk suoka um chu Esther kuoma inen- tira, ama kuoma chun hrilfie dingin a pêk bawk a; chun, a chihai ta dinga lal kuoma chun fe a, a kuoma chun ngênna siem a, a hmaa chun hni dingin phût a ni bawk a."
And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.,"Hathak chu a hung a, Mordekai thuhai po po chu Esther chu a hril tah a."
"Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai, saying:","Esther chun Hathak kuoma chun thu a hril a, Mordekai kuoma chun thucha ân phur a;"
"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.","“Tukhawm, nuhmei ni sien, pasal ni sien khawm, ko ni si loa, lal tuollai sûnghnung lema hung lût ta ding chun, ama chu hring a tih, tia lalin a rângkachak hmawl chu a lo lâk kâng si naw chun dân pakhat chau, ama chu that ngei nîng a tih, ti dân hi a um a nih ti lal siehlawhai po po le, lal rambunga mihai po po chun an hriet chieng hleh a; nisienlakhawm, kei chu hieng ni sâwmthum sûng hin lal kuoma lût dinga koin ka um dêr nawh a,” tiin."
And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.,"Chun, Esther thuhai chu Mordekai chu an hril a."
"Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.","Mordekai khawm chun a dawn- na chu Esther kuoma chun ân phur- kîrtir nâwk a, “Juda mihai po po pumpel naw chu, lal ina nang khan pumpel bîk dingin inngaituo naw rawh."
"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?","Hi hi huna i to ṭawk ṭawk a, Judahai ta dinga himna le sansuokna hmun danga inthawkin a hung suok khawmin, nang le i pa sûngkuo chu bohmang tho ei tih; hieng ang lai huna ding hin a ni el thei i sawnnaw, lal nina i chang hi,” tiin."
"Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,","Chun, Esther chun Mordekai kuomah a dawnna chu ân phurkîr nâwk a."
"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.","“Fe la, Susaa Juda mi umhai po po chu kei khâwm rawh; chun, ka ta dingin bu nghei unla; sûn le zânah, ni thum sûng chu fain dâwn hlek naw ro, ka nunghâkhai le kei khawma chuong ang bawk chun nghei kan ta; chuongchun, dân lo ang ni sien khawm lal kuoma chun lût el ka ta; ka bohmang leh ka bohmang ni el raw se,” tiin."
"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.","Chuongchun, Mordekai chu a feh a, Estherin thu a pêk ang pei chun a thaw tah a."
"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.","A ni thum ni chun, Esther chu a lal puonin ân thuom a, lal in zâwn tak, lal in tuollai sûnghnung lema chun a ngîr tah a; lal khawm chu in lûtna zâwn takah, lal ina lalṭhung- phaa chun a ṭhung a."
"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.","Chun, lalnu Esther chu tuollaia ngîr a hmu chun, a mithmua chun ditsakna a hlaw tah a; chuongchun, lal chun rângkachak hmawl a kuta a chawi chu Esther kuoma chun a lâk kâng tah a. Chuongchun, Esther chu a hung hnai a, rângkachak hmawl hmawr chu a them tah a."
"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ieng am i dit a, lalnu Esther, ieng am a na i hni chu? Ram chenve rau khawm ni sien i kuoma pêk nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.","Esther chun, “Lal hin ṭha a ti zâwng a ni chun, a ta dinga thlai- thlêng vawisûna ka buotsai hi, fa dingin lal le Haman chu hung raw hai se,” a ta."
"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.","Lal chun, “Esther hril ang ngeia thaw a ni theina dingin Haman chu hung inhmâwtir ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, lal le Haman chu Estherin thlaithlêng a buotsaia chun an hung tah a."
"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.","Chun, lal chun uoin dâwn huna chun Esther kuoma chun, “I hnina chu ieng am a na? I kuomah phal a ni ngei ding a nih, i ngên khawm chu ieng am a na? Ram chenve rau khawm ni sienla thaw nîng a tih,” a ta."
"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:","Esther chun a dawn a, “Ka hnina le ka ngênna chu;"
"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.","lal mithmua hin ditsak tlâk ka ni a, ka hnina hi phal ding le ka ngênna hi thaw dinga lal ṭhati zâwng a ni chun, an ta dinga thlaithlêng ka buotsai dinga hin lal le Haman hi hung ngei raw hai se; chun, chu chu lalin a hril ta angin zînga hin hril ka tih,” tiin."
"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.","Chu ni chun Haman chu lungril lâwmtak le hlimtak chun a fe suok tah a; nisienlakhawm, lal kul kawt- khâra chun ama ta dinga châng loa, a ngîr khawm lo ngîr lo Mordekai a hmu chun, Mordekai chungah nasa- takin a lunginsen tah a."
"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.","Nisienlakhawm, Haman chu ân sûm a, a inah a fe tah a; mi a tir a, a ruolhai le a nuhmei Zeres a ko tah a."
"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.","Chuongchun, Haman chun an kuoma chun, a hausaknahai ropuizie dâm, a nauhai tamzie dâm, lalin ama chu ân kaisângtirna thilhai po po dâm, lal siehlawhai le lalhai chunga ama a siechungzie dâm chu a hril tah a."
"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.","Chu naw khawm chu, Haman chun, “Anih, lalnu Esther chun kei ti chau lo chu lal le thlaithlêng a buotsai awt dingin tukhawm a fiel ngai naw bawk a; chuongchun, zinga khawm hin kei chu lal leh fiel ka nih a."
"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.","Anachu lal kul kawtkhâra Juda mi Mordekai ṭhunga ka hmu sûng phawt chu hieng thilhai po po hin a mi sukhawi chuong nawh,” a ta."
"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.","Chun, a nuhmei Zeres le a ruol- hai po po chun a kuomah, “Khaihlum- na tawng sâwmngaa insâng inphun- tir la, chun a zinga chun, chutaka chun Mordekai chu khai hlum ni raw se, tiin lal chu hril la; chuongchun, lal le chun thlaithlêng awtnaa chun hlimtakin um el la a ni el annâwm,” an tih a. Chun, chu thil chun Haman chu a suklâwm tah a; chun, khai- hlumna chu ân phuntir tah a."
"On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.","Chu zân chun lal chu a in thei ta nawh a; lal chanchin hriet zing dinga ziekna lekhabu chu hung la dingin thu a pêk a; chuongchun, lal hmaa chun tiem an ni tah a."
"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.","Lal Ahasuer chunga kut thlâkna zawngtuhai, kawtkhâr vêngtu, lal vêngtu pahni Teres le Bigthan chan- chin chu Mordekaiin a hril a nih tia hmu suok a ni tah a."
"And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.","Chun, lal chun, “Hi hi ding hin Mordekai chunga chun ieng chawi- mawina le insângna am siem a ni tah a?” a ta. Chun, lal siehlaw, ama rawngbâwltuhai chun, “Ama ta ding- in iengkhawm thaw a ni nawh,” an ta."
"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.","Lal chun, “Tu am a na tuollaia um saw?” a ta. Chulaitak chun, Haman chu ama ta dinga a buotsai khaihlumnaa Mordekai chu khai- hlum ding thu hril dingin, lal tuollai puo lema chun a hung lût a."
"And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.","Chun, lal siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Haman chu tuol- laia saw a ngîr zing ie,” an ta. Lal chun, “Hung inlûttir ro,” a ta."
"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?","Chuongchun, Haman chu a hung lût tah a. Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Lalin chawimawi a nuom mi kuoma chun ieng anga thaw ding am nîng a ta?” a ta. Chuongchun, Haman chun a lungrilin, “Kei naw chu lal hin tu dang am chawimawi nuom a ta?” a ta."
"And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,","Chuongchun, Haman chun lal kuoma chun, “Lalin mi chawimawi a nuom chu,"
"let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:","lalin a sil hlak lal puon le, lal chuongna hlak sakawr, a lua lallu- khum khum chu hung lâk ni sienla;"
"and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.","chun, ‘Lalin mi a chawimawi nuom chunga chun hienga thaw hi a ni ding a nih,’ tia, a hmaa khêk a, kawtthlêra chun sakawr chunga in- chuongtir a, lalin chawimawi a nuom mi chu an inthuomtir vawng theina dingin lal mi ṭhatakhai laia pakhat kutah sakawr le silfên chu pêk ni raw se,” a ta."
"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.","Chun, lal chun Haman kuoma chun, “Inhmaw la, i hril ang chun lal silfên le sakawr chu la la, lal kul kawtkhâr bula ṭhung, Juda mi Mor- dekai chunga chun va thaw rawh; i hril ang ta po po chu iengkhawm kimlo um hlek loin,” a ta."
"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.","Chuongchun, Haman chun lal silfên le sakawr chu a lâk a, Mordekai chu a thuom a, “Lalin mi a chawi- mawi nuom chunga chun hienga thaw hi a ni ding a nih,” tia khêk peiin, kawtthlêra chun ân chuongtir tah a."
"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered.","Chun, Mordekai chu lal kul kawtkhâra chun a hung nâwk a. Haman ruok chu a lu inkhumin, lungngaitakin a in tieng a fe tah a."
"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.","Chun, Haman chun a nuhmei Zeres le a ruolhai po po kuoma chun a chunga thil hung tlunghai chu a hril nâwk tah a. A mi varhai le a nuhmei Zeres chun a kuomah, “Mordekai, a hmaa i tlûkna chu, Juda chia mi a ni hrim hrim chun, ama chu ngam naw ti ni, a hmaa chun tlu ngei lem i tih,” an ta."
"While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.","Chuonga ama an biek zing lai chun, lal vêngtuhai chu an hung a, Estherin a buotsai thlaithlêng awt ding chun Haman chu an ṭhuoi tah a."
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.,"Chuongchun, lal le Haman chu lalnu Estherin thlaithlêng a buotsai chu an awt tah a."
"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.","Chun, uoin dâwn huna a ni hni ni chun lal chun Esther kuoma chun, “I hnina ieng am a na, lalnu Esther?

"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:","Chun, lalnu Esther chun a dâwn a, “I mithmua hin ditsak tlâk ka na, aw lalpa, lal ṭhati zâwng a ni chun; ka ingêna hin ka chipuihai le, ka ihnia hin keima hringna ngei hi hla ni el raw se:"
"for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage.","sukchimit ding le, that ding le, sukbohmang ding sa, kei le ka chipuihai hi zawr kan ni ta sih a.

"Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?","Chun, lal Ahasuer chun a biek a, lalnu Esther kuoma chun, “Chuong ang thil a lungrila thaw ngam chu khawlai am a um a? Ama chu tu am a na?” a ta."
"And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.","Esther chun, “Hmêlma le khing- pui chu hi mi rilotak Haman hi a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Haman chu lal le lalnu hmaa chun a ṭi tah a."
And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.,"Chun, lal chu a lunginsen chun uoin dâwn lai chu a tho a, lal in huona chun a va fe tah a; chun, lalnu Esther kuoma a hringna ta dinga ngên dingin Haman khawm chu a ngîr tah a; a chunga chun thiltum ṭha nawtak lal chun a nei ti a hmu ta sih a."
"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.","Chun, lal chu lal in huona in- thawk chun uoin dâwnna hmuna chun a hung kîr nâwk a; Esther umna ṭhungpha chunga chun Haman chu a bawkkhup a.

"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.","Chun, lal hmaa um hlak, mi tillâkhai laia mi pakhat Harbona chun, “Ngai ta, lal ta dinga thu ṭha hriltu Mordekai ta dinga khaihlumna tawng sâwmngaa insâng Hamanin a siem chu, Haman ina khun ân phun a nih,” a ta."
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.,"Chun, lal chun, “Chutaka chun ama kha khai hlum ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, Mordekai ta dinga khaihlumna a buotsaia chun Haman chu an khai hlum tah a. Chun, lal lunginsen chu a hung dam tah a."
On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.,"Chu ni chun lal Ahasuer chun Judahai hmêlmapa Haman in chu lalnu Esther kuoma chun a pêk tah a. Chun, Mordekai khawm chu lal hmaa chun a hung tah a; Esther chun ama chu a ieng am a ni chu a lo hril ta sih a."
"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.","Chun, lal chun Hamana in- thawka a lâk, a kutsebi chu a lâk thlâk a, Mordekai kuoma chun a pêk tah a. Chun, Esther chun Haman in chu Mordekai chu ân enkawltir tah a."
"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.","Chun, Esther chun lal kuoma chun thu a la hril nâwk a, a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, Agag mi Haman thil sukpawi le, Juda mihai chunga a thil phierrûkna rawt chu siehmang dingin mitthli pumin a ngên a."
"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.","Chun, lal chun rângkachak hmawl chu Esther kuoma chun a lâk kâng a."
"And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king’s provinces:","Chuongchun, Esther chu a tho a, lal hmaa chun a ngîr tah a. Chun, ama chun, “Lal ṭha ti zâwng a na, a mithmua hin ditsakna ka chang a, hi thil hi lal kuomah indika ân lang chun, le a mit ka tlung chun, Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Hamanin Juda mi lal rambung po poa umhai sukbo- hmangna dinga a ziek lekhathawnhai chu sukdanglam dinga ziek ni raw se:"
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?,"ka chipuihai chunga chuong thil ṭha naw hung tlung ding chu iengtin am tuor thei ka ta? Annawleh, ka chi le kuonghai suksieta an umna chu ka en ngam ding am a nih?” a ta."
"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.","Chun, lal Ahasuer chun lalnu Esther kuoma le Mordekai Juda mi kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, Haman in hi Esther kuoma chun ka pêk tah a, ama chu khaihlumnaa chun an khai hlum ta bawk a; Juda mihai chunga a kut ân let leiin."
"Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.","Chuongchun, ṭha in ti angin, lal hmingin Judahai kuoma chun lekha ziek unla, lal kutsebi hin nam ro; lal hminga lekha ziek a, lal kutsebia nam chu, tukhawma an sukdanglam thei âwm si nawh a,” a ta."
"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.","Chuongchun, chu huna chun, thla thumna, Sivan thla, chu thla ni sâwmhni pathum ni chun lal lekha- ziektuhai chu koin an um tah a; chuongchun, Mordekaiin Juda mihai kuoma thu a pêk ang po poin, ram- bung za sâwmhni pasari, Indiaa inthawka Ethiopia chena rambunga lalhai, rorêltuhai le ram awptuhai kuoma chun, rambung tin kuoma chutaka ziek ang peiin, chi tinhai kuomah an ṭawng ang peiin.

"And he wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud:","Chun, ama chun lal Ahasuer hmingin a ziek a, lal kutsebi chun a nam a, lal sinthawnaa hmang hlak sakawr hrât mi sakawr sâwizawi chunga chuongin, sakawr chungah lekhathawnhai chu dâkah a thawn tah a;"
"wherein the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,","chutaka chun lal chun Juda mihai khaw tina umhai chu inkei khâwma, lo invêng him dingin a tih a.

"upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.","Lal Ahasuer rambung po poah ni khat sûng, Adar thla, thla sâwm pahnina, ni sâwmpathum ni sûng chun chu;"
"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.","Judahai chu an hmêlmahai chunga an phuba la ve dingin chu ni chun an inzosa zing ding a nih ti le, rambung tina thupêk pêk suok dinga ziek, zieksâwng chu chi tinhai kuoma chun ziek suok vawng a ni tah a."
"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.","Chuongchun, dâk phur mihai, lal sinthawnaa hmang hlak sakawr hrâthai chunga chuonghai chu, lal thupêk inawr zing chun inhmaw- takin an fe suok tah a; thupêk chu Susa khawpuia inthawka pêk a nih."
"And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.","Chun, Mordekai chu lal puon dumpâwl zai inhmi leh, rângkachak lallukhum ropuitak leh, lal silfên dumpâwl le vâra inthuomin lal hmai- hmaa chu a fe suok tah a; chuong- chun, Susa khawpui chu lâwmin a khêk tah a."
"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.","Chun, Judahai khawm chun var le lâwmna le hlimna le chawimawina chu an chang ta bawk a."
"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.","Chun, rambung tin le khaw tinah, lal thupêk a tlungna taphawta chun, Judahai chun lâwmna le hlimna an nei a, ni ṭha le ruoiṭhena dâm an nei ta bawk a.

"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them),","Chun, thla sâwmpahnina, Adar thlaa ni sâwmpathum nia, lal thupêk le a thu sukthlûk chu thaw ding ni a hung hnai chun, chuong nia Juda hmêlmahaiin an chunga ro nei an beisei huna chun; a naw zâwngin a hung um ta thut a, Judahai chun anni theidatuhai chunga chun ro an nei lem tah a;"
"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.","anni suknat tumtuhai chunga kut thlâk dingin, lal Ahasuer ram- bung po poa chun Judahai chu an khawpuihaia chun an inko khâwm tâwl a; tukhawma an dang zo si nawh a, anni ṭitna chu hnam po pohai chunga chun a tlung ta sih a."
"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king’s business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.","Chun, rambunghaia lalhai le, ram awptuhai le, rorêltuhai le lal sin thawtuhai chun Judahai chu an ṭhangpui a; Mordekai ṭina chu an chunga chun a um tlat ta leiin."
"For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.","Mordekai chu lal ina chun ropui- tak a ni sih a, a chanchin chu ram- bung po poa chun ân thang a; chu Mordekai chu a hung inṭhang lien tiel tiel el sih a."
"And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them.","Chuongchun, Judahai chun an hmêlmahai po po chu kâwlhnâma sâtin an sât hlum tâwl a, suksietna le thatnain anni theidatuhaiin an chunga an thaw ding ang tak chun an thaw tah a."
And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.,Lal khawpui Susaa ngei khawm Judahai chun mi za nga an sukbo- hmang a.
"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,","Chun, Parsandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha;"
"and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,","Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha;"
"and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,","Parmasta, Arisai, Aridai le Vaizatha hai;"
"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.","Judahai hmêlma Hammedatha naupa Haman naupasal sâwmhai khawm chu an that a; amiruokchu, râllâk suma ruok chun an kut an rawl nawh a."
On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.,Chu ni chun Susa khawpuia thata umhai nizât chu lal kuoma chun hung lâk a na.
"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.","Chun, lal chun lalnu Esther kuoma chun, “Judahai chun Susa khawpuia hin mi za nga le Haman naupasalhai sâwm an thatin an sukbohmang ta a nih; lal rambung danghaia chun ieng ang khieuin am an thaw ding chu. Tuhin i hnina chu ieng am a na? Phalpêk ning i tih; annawleh, ieng am a na i la hni rawp ding? Thaw ni bawk a tih,” a ta."
"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.","Chun, Esther chun, “Lal ṭhati zâwng a ni chun, vawisûna thupêk ang bawk hin, Susaa Juda umhai chu zinga khawm thaw dinga phal ni hai sienla, Haman naupasal sâwmhai chu khaihlumnahaia chun khai kâng ni raw hai se,” a ta."
And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.,"Chun, lal chun chuong anga thaw ding chun thu a pêk a, Susaa inthawk chun thupêk chu pêk suok a ni tah a; chuongchun, Haman naupa- sal sâwmhai chu an khâi kâng tah a."
"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.","Chun, Adar thla ni sâwmpali ni khawm chun Susaa Juda mi umhai chu an inkei khâwm a, Susaa chun mi za thum an that a; nisienlakhawm, râllâk suma ruok chun an kut an rawl nawh a."
"And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.","Chun, lal rambung danga Juda umhai khawm chu anni le anni chu an inkei khâwm tâwl a, an hringna sanin an ngîr a, an hmêlmahaia in- thawk chun râlmuongin an um a, anni theidâtuhai sîng sari le sâng nga an that a; amiruokchu, annia râllâk sum chu an lâk nawh a."
"This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.","Adar thla ni sâwmpathum ni chun hi hi thaw a ni tah a; chun, chu thla ma ni sâwmpali ni chun an châwl a, lâwmna le ruoiṭhena niin an hmang a."
"But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.","Amiruokchu, Susaa Juda mi umhai chu, chu thla ni sâwmpathum ni le sâwmpali ni khawm chun an inkhâwm a; chu thla ma ni sâwm- panga ni chun an châwl a, lâwmna le ruoiṭhena niin an hmang a."
"Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.","Chuleiin, khaw kul neiloa um- hai Juda khuoa mihai chun Adar thlaa ni sâwmpali ni chu lâwmna le ruoiṭhena le, ni ṭhaa le, thilpêk inthawn niah an hmang tah a."
"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,","Chun, Mordekai chun hieng thilhai hi a ziek a, lal Ahasuer ram- bung po poa Juda um po pohai kuomah, a hla le hnaia khawm,"
"to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,",Adar thla ni sâwmpali ni le ni sâwmpanga ni hi kum tinin inser dinga sukdet dingin lekhathawnhai ân phur tah a;
"as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.","chuong nihaia chun Juda mihai chun an hmêlmahaia inthawka châwl an neina nihai a ni lei le, chu thla chu an ta dinga lungngaina lâwmnaa inchangna le ṭapna ni ṭhaa inchang- na thla a ni leiin: hlimna le ruoiṭhena ni, chanvohai inphurtuona ni le, mi pasiehai kuoma thilpêkhai pêkna nihaiah an nei ding thu a pêk a."
"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;","Chuongchun, Juda mihai chun, Mordekaiin an kuoma a ziek ang ngei le, an lo ṭan ta ang chun thaw dingin an nei tah a;"
"because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;","Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Haman, Judahai po po hmêlmapa chun, anni sukbohmang dingin a lo phierrûk a, anni sukbohmanga suk- chimit dingin Pur, chu chu aisân a nih, a lo sân tah a;"
"but when the matter came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.","amiruokchu, chu thil chu lal kuom a hung tlung chun, a dawhâ ṭha lotak, Judahai chunga dawhâ a nei chu, ama lu chung ngeiah a tla lem ding a nih tiin lekha ziekin thu a pêk a, ama le a naupasalhai ngei khawm chu khaihlumnahaia chun khai kâng an ni ding a nih, tiin."
"Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them,","Chuleiin, hieng nihai hi Pur hming chawi chun Purim an lo inbûk tah a. Chuleiin, chu lekha thuziek po po lei le, chu chungthua an ihmu ta ang lei le, an chunga thil hung tlung- na lei chun,"
"the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year;","Judahai chun, anni le an thla- hai le anni hung sûngkhattuhai po po chunga chun belin, an namdet tah a; kum tinin chutaka a ni ruot ang tak le, chutaka ziek ang taka chu ni hni- hai chu insera bâwpel ngai hlek lo dingin;"
"and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.","khaw tina le rambung tina le sûngkaw tinah, suon po po chenin hi nihai hi hriet zinga inser ding a na; hieng Purim nihai hi Juda mihai laia chun bâwpel a ni ngai ding a ni nawh a, an thlahai laia chun hriet zing an nina hi a bohmang bawk naw ding a nih."
"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.","Chun, Abihail naunu, lalnu Esther le Juda mi Mordekai chun hi Purim lekha pahnina hi sukdet ding- in thuneitakin an ziek tah a."
"And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,","Chun, Juda mi po pohai kuom- ah, Ahasuer lalram, rambung za sâwmhni pasaria chun, thudik le thlamuonna thuhai le chun lekha- thawnhai chu a thawn tah a;"
"to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.","Juda mi Mordekai le lalnu Estherin anni an ruotpêk ang le, an ṭap khêk râwl le an bungheina chungthua an thlahai le anni ta dinga an ruotpêk ang ngeia, hieng Purim nihai hi a hun ruothaia sukdet dingin."
And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.,"Chun, Esther thupêk chun hi Purim chungthu hi a sukdet a; lekha- bua chun ziek a ni tah a."
