"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.",Paula le Silvan le Timothe chun: Pa Pathien le Lalpa Isu Kristaa Thessalonikaa kohranhai kuomah: Lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;","Kan ṭawngṭainahaia chun in hming lamin, nangni po po leiin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu kan hril hlak a nih."
"remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;","Ei Pathien le Pa hmaa ringna leia in sin thawzie dâm, hmangaina leia in sin inrimzie dâm, ei Lalpa Isu Krista beisei leia in selzie dâm kha theinghil loa hre zingin."
"knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,","Unau Pathien idittakhai, a thlangzie cheu kha kan hriet a,"
"how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.","khânga kan Chanchin Ṭha chu thu chaua tlung loa, thilthawtheina le Thlarau Inthieng le nasataka ring tlatna leh a hung tlung lem kha. Nangni hma sielin in chungah ieng ang mi am kan lo ni ta kha in hriet sih a."
"And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;","Chun, thu chu rinum tuor pumin Thlarau Inthienga lâwmin in lo pawm a, keini le Lalpa inchûktuhai in lo nih."
so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.,"Chuongchun, Makedonia le Akaia rama ringtuhai po po ta dingin enkhina in hung ni kha,"
"For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.","Lalpa thu chu nangnia inthawk- in ân thang suok ta sih a; Makedonia le Akaia rama chau ni loin, hmun tina khan Pathien tienga in ringzie chu ân thang tah a; chuongchun, keinîn iengkhawm hril hrim a ngai ta nawh."
"For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,","Nangni laiah ieng ang lawm- lûtna am kan dawng anni ngeiin an inhriettir a; milimhai chu Pathien tienga in nghatsanzie, Pathien hring le indiktak rawng bâwl ding le,"
"and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.","a Naupa mithi laia inthawka a ikeitho, lunginsenna hung tlung dinga inthawka a mi sansuoktu Isu kha vâna inthawka hung lo nghâk dinga in nghatsanzie khawm kha an inhriettir bawk hlak a nih."
"For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:","Unauhai, nangni laia kan hung lûtna kha a lo thlâwn nawh ti nangni ngeiin in hriet sih a;"
"but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.","thlâwn nêk hmanin, in hriet ta angin, kha hma khan Philippia chun rinum tuor le inzaktaka siemin lo um ta inlang khawm, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha chu, kan Pathiena huoina neiin, dodâlna nasatak kârah, in kuomah kan puong ta lem kha."
"For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:","Kan thu hril hi khêla suok a ni si nawh a, inthieng nawnaa suok a ni bawk nawh a, zâwrnain a ni bawk nawh a;"
"but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts.","Chanchin Ṭha inkawltira um dingin Pathien ṭhati zâwng mi kan ni ang ngeiin, mihriem suklâwm ding ang ni loin, kan lungril fietu Pathien suklâwm lemin thu kan hril lem hlak a nih."
"For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;","Ieng lai khawma inpâk tehlêmna thu amanih, duâm inkhumna ama- nih, kan hmang lai an hriet nawh ti in hriet kha (Pathien a mi hrietpuitu a nih.)"
"nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.","Mihriem laiah, nangni laia manih, mi danghai laia mani khawm chawimawina kan zawng ngai nawh;"
"But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children:","Krista tirkohai kan nina leiin inkhâwkpuium kan lo ni el thei de khawmin. Nu nau pawmin ama nau- hai a duot angin, nangni laiah zaidamtakin kan um lem kha."
"even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.","Chuong ang bawkin, kan dit zâwng tak in hung ni ta lei khan, kan dit ngawi ngawi cheu a, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha chau ni loin kan hring- na rau khawm pêk cheu kan inhuom kha."
"For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.","Unauhai, kan thaw sâwlzie le kan sin inrimzie kha in hriet zing deh! nangni laia tûkhawm kan sukkhâwk nawna ding cheuin a sûn a zâna sin thawin, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha kan hril hlak cheu kha."
"Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe:","Nangni ringtuhai chungah in- thiengtak le feltak le, demum lotaka kan umzie kha Pathien leh a mi hrietpuituhai in nih;"
"as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying,","pain ama nauhai chunga a thaw angin in chunga kan thawzie kha in hriet, infui le thlamuon le inhriettir cheuin, in chung senga kan thawzie kha;"
"to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.",Ama ram le ropuinaa kolûttu cheu Pathien mi ni tlâka in um theina dingin.
"And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.","Hi hi lei hin ma loin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu kan hril bawk hlak, Pathien thu kan kuoma inthawka in hriet, in pawm lai khan, mihriem thu pawmin in pawm nawh a, Pathien thu pawma in pawm lem lei khan; chu chu Pathien thu a ni hrim a, nangni a ringtuhai sûnga sin thaw hlak bawk chu a nih."
"For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judæa in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;","Nangni unauhai, Judai rama Pathien kohran, Krista Isua umhai inchûktu in lo ni kha; anni chun Judahai laia an tuor angin nangni khawmin nangni rama mihai laia inthawkin in tuor ve bawk sih a."
"who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men;","Chuong Judahai chun Lalpa Isu le zâwlneihai khawm an that a, keini khawm an mi hnawt suok a, Pathien an suklâwm nawh a, mi po po an kal hlak;"
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.,"sandam an ni theina dinga Jentailhai laia thu hril an mi khap hlak sih a, chuong anga an suol inkhi- na suksip rawp dingin, nisienla- khawm, lunginsenna chu an chungah a tâwp khâwk râwtin a hung tlung tah."
"But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire:","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, sâwt nâwtea dingin nangni leh lungril tienga inṭhe loin, hmêl tieng chaua inṭhea ei um hri lei hin, inhâwk tak puma in hmêl hmu dingin kan beisei nasa nâwk zuol hlak a nih;"
"because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.","in kuomah hung kan tum tlat sih a; kei Paula ngei khawm hin vawi hni rau hung ka tum nghe nghe tah a; nisienlakhawm, Setanin a mi hluo hlak a nih."
"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?","Kan beiseina amanih, kan hlimna amanih, kan lallukhum suong amani chu ieng am a na? A hung phaleh ei Lalpa Isu hmaa chun nangni ngei in ni ding a ni naw am a nih?"
For ye are our glory and our joy.,Nangni hi kan isuong le kan hlimna in nih in sawnnaw.
"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;","Chuongchun, kan tuor zo ta naw tika chun Atheniah keini chau mâksanin um inlang ṭha kan tih a."
"and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;","Timothe ei unaupa, Krista Chan- chin Ṭha tienga Pathien rawngbâwl- tu hi sukdet ding cheu le in ringna kawnga thlamuon ding cheuin kan hung tir a nih;"
that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.,hieng rinum tuorna lei hin tûkhawm an inhnîng nawna dingin; hienghai hi tuor dinga ruot kan nih ti nangni ngeiin in hriet sih a.
"For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.","In kuoma kan um lai khan rinum tuor ding kan nih ti kan hril lâwk ngei cheu kha; chuong ang ngei chun a hung tlung tah a, chu chu in hriet kha."
"For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.","Chuleichun, ka tuor zo ta naw phingleh, thlêmtu chun thlêm thlu hlau rawi a ti cheu a, kan sin inrimna chu thlâwn rawi a tih, tiin in ringzie ka lo hriet theina dingin mi ka hung tir a nih."
"But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you;","Nisienlakhawm, Timothe chu in kuoma inthawka tuta kan kuoma a hung tlung hin, hmu cheu kan inhâwk ang bawkin, mi hmu inhâwk bêk bêkin ngainatakin in mi hriet zing ti thu le, in ringna le in hmangaina chanchin lâwmum tak a mi hâwn a."
"for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:","Chuleiin, unauhai, kan lungin- rimna le rinumna po poah, in ringna leiin in chungah thlamuongtakin kan um tah."
"for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.","Tuhin chu kan hring tah, Lalpaah in ngîr det phawt hin chu."
"For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;","Ei Pathien hmaah in chunga kan hlimna po po lei hin, nangni tieng thuah ieng lâwmthu am Pathien kuomah hril ve thei kan ti aw?"
"night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?","In hmêl kan hmu theina ding le, in ringna tienga in tlâksamna kan phuhrûk pêk theina ding cheuin a sûn a zânin nasatakin kan ṭawngṭai zing a nih."
"Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:","Chuongchun, ei Pathien le ei Pa ngei chun, ei Lalpa Isu khawmin nangni kuom tiengah mi ṭhuoi raw se."
"and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you;","Chun, nangni tienga hmangai- na kan hau angin, nangni laia inhmangaituona le mi po po tienga hmangaina chu Lalpain sukpungin inhautir raw se cheu;"
"to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.","chuongchun, ei Lalpa Isu, a mi inthienghai po po le a hung pha, ei Pathien le ei Pa hmaah in lungrilhai inthiengna kawngah sawisêlboin sukdet thei a ti cheu."
"Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk,—that ye abound more and more.","Chuongchun, unauhai, a tâwp taka chun, in um dân ding le Pathien in suklâwm dân ding (tuta in um dân hi) kan kuoma inthawka in lâk ang khan in hau nâwk zuolna dingin Lalpa Isua chun kan ngênin kan infui cheu a nih."
For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.,Lalpa Isu zâra chun ieng thuhai am kan pêk cheu kha in hriet sih a.
"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;","Pathien dit zâwng, in inthiengna ding chu, hi hi a nih, indit bânsan unla;"
"that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,",inthieng le chawimawiin mâni bêl vawng thiem seng ro.
"not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;",Pathien hre naw Jentailhai anga hur kawnga châk loin;
"that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.","chu kawnga chun tûkhawmin bawsein, a unau chungah thil ṭha naw chu thaw naw sien la, Lalpa chu chuong ang thil thawtuhai po po phuba latu a ni leiin–keini khawmin kan hril lâwkin kan inhriettir ta cheu ang khan."
"For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.","Pathienin inthieng naw dingin a mi ko si nawh a, inthieng dingin a mi ko lem a nih."
"Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.","Chuleiin, a pawisa nawtu chu mihriem pawisa naw a ni nawh a, Pathien, a Thlarau Inthieng pe hlaktu cheu kha pawisa naw a ni lem."
But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;,"Amiruokchu, unauhai, hmangai kawng thu chu ziek pêk cheu in ngai nawh, inhmangai tuo dingin nangni ngei Pathien inchûktirin in um sih a."
"for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;","Makedonia ram pumpuia unau umhai po po chunga chun chu chu in thaw ngei bawk a nih: nisien- lakhawm, unauhai, thaw nâwkzuol deu deu dingin kan infui cheu a nih."
"and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;","Kan hril ta cheu ang khan dei dapa um a, mâni sin seng ngaisak a, mâni kut ngeia sin thaw tum tlat ro."
"that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.","Chuongchun, puo tienga mihai chungah mawitakin um thei in ta, iengkhawm tlasam naw ti niu."
"But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, mi dang beiseina hrim nei nawhai anga in lungngai nâwna dingin, a inhai chanchin in hriet naw kan nuom nawh."
"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.","Isu a thih a, a tho nâwk tah ti ei ring si chun, Isua intahai chu Pathienin ama ruolin hung ṭhuoi sa ngei a tih."
"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.","Hi hi Lalpa thuin in kuomah kan hril a nih; eini Lalpa hung pha chena dama lo la um zinghai hin, a in tahai chu lekhal naw tawp ei tih, ti hi."
"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;","Lalpa ngei chu khêkri leh, vântirko chunghnungtak râwl leh, Pathien tawtawrâwt ri leh, vâna inthawkin a hung ṭum ding a ni sih a; chun, Kristaa thi tahai chu tho hmasâng an tih."
"then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.","Chu hnunga chun eini dama lo la um zinghai hi boruokah Lalpa tuok dingin annihai ruolin sûm laiahai khin zuk lâkin um ei tih; chuongchun, Lalpa kuomah kumkhuoin um tâng ei tih."
Wherefore comfort one another with these words.,"Chuleiin, hieng thu hin inthla- muon tuo ro."
"But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.","Amiruokchu, unauhai, a hun le a ni kawng thu hrim ziekpêk in ngai nawh a."
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.,Lalpa Ni chu zâna inru angin a hung tlung ding a nih ti nangni ngeiin chiengtakin in hriet sih a.
"When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.","“Muongna le himna,” tia an hril lai takin, nuhmei nauhase angin kârloin an chungah bohmangna hung tlung a tih, pumpel naw tawp an tih."
"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, nang- ni ruok chu, chu Ni chun inru anga a nangna ding cheuin inthimah in um nawh."
"for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;","Var nauhai le Ni nauhai in ni vawng sih a, zâna mi ei ni nawh a, inthima mi ei ni bawk nawh."
"so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.","Chuleichun, mi danghai angin in ta nâwng ei tiu khai! Meng ei tiu a, fîmkhurin ngaiven lem ei tiu."
For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.,"A inhai chu zânah a nih an in hlak chu, zu inruihai khawm zânah a nih an inrui hlak chu."
"But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.","Nisienlakhawm, eini chu nia mi ei ni lei hin, ringna le hmangaina âwmphaw chu hâkin, sandamna beiseina chu lukhuma hmangin ngaiven lem ei tiu."
"For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,","Pathienin lunginsenna tuor ding ni loin, ei Lalpa Isu Krista zâra sandamna hmu ding lema a mi ruot a ni sih a."
"who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.","Ei meng khawma, ei in khawm- a, ama leh ei hring kawp theina dingin ama chu ei thi aiin a thi a nih."
"Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.","Chuleiin, infui tuoin insukṭha- hnem tuo seng ro, in thaw hrim hlak ang khan."
"But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, kan ngên cheu a nih: nangni laia sin inrim le Lalpaa in hotua um le, a kâwktuhai cheu chu hre ding le,"
and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.,an sinthaw leia hmangaia ngaihlu bêk bêk dingin. Inremin um ro.
"And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.","Chun, unauhai, kan ngên cheu, dân ang nawa umhai chu kâwk unla, lungril chînhai chu infui unla, a hrât nawhai chu ṭhangpui unla, mi po po chungah dâwthei takin um ro."
"See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.","Tûkhawmin tu suol khawm suola thung lo dingin fîmkhur ro; thil in inthawpêk tuona tieng le, mi po po chunga in thawpêkna tienga khawm a ṭha taphawt chu hnawt lem rawp ro."
Rejoice always;,"Lâwm rawp unla,"
pray without ceasing;,"ma loin ṭawngṭai unla,"
in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.,iengkimah lâwmthu hril rawp ro; chu chu nangni tieng thuah Krista Isua chun Pathien dit zâwng a ni sih a.
Quench not the Spirit;,Thlarau chu sukmit naw ro.
despise not prophesyings;,Thu hrilhai hmusit naw ro;
prove all things; hold fast that which is good;,"iengkim infie lem unla, a ṭha ṭha chu pawm tlat ro."
abstain from every form of evil.,Suol anga inlang po poa inthawk chun insiekieng ro.
"And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Chun, inremna Pathien ngei chun, in pumin sukthieng raw se cheu; chun, in thlarau le, in lungril le in taksa chu ei Lalpa Isu Krista a hung pha chun, sawisêlboa a puma humhimin um raw se."
"Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.","A kotu cheu chu ring a um a, thaw khawm thaw ngei bawk a tih."
"Brethren, pray for us.","Unauhai, mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro."
Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.,Unau po pohai kha fâwp inthiengin chibai mi bûkpêk ro.
I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.,Hi lekha hi unau po po kuoma chun tiem dingin Lalpa hmingin ka phût cheu.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.,Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lungin- sietna chu in kuomah um raw se.
