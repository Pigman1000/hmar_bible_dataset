"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,","Paula, Pathien ditzâwnga Isu Krista tirko dinga ko le unaupa Sosthen chun:"
"unto the church of God which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours:","Korintha Pathien kohran umhai, Krista Isua sukthieng, mi inthieng ni dinga kohai kuomah, ram tina ei Lalpa (anni le eini Lalpa) Isu Krista hming lamtuhai po po kuoma leh."
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawkin lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
"I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;",Krista Isua Pathien lunginsietna in kuoma pêka um lei khan in chungthuah Pathien kuomah lâwm- thu ka hril rawp hlak a nih.
"that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;","Iengkimah, thu hril tinrêng le hrietna tinrêngah amaa chun suk- hausaa in um thua khan;"
even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:,"chuongchun, Krista thu inhriet- tira um kha nangnia sukdetin a um kha;"
so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;,"chuongchun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista inlârna nghâkin thilpêk hrim hrimah in hlawtling naw nawh a."
"who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye be unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",Ama chun ei Lalpa Isu Krista niah sawisêlboa in um theina dingin a tâwp chenin sukdet bawk a ti cheu.
"God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",Pathien a Naupa ei Lalpa Isu Krista pâwlnaa ko lûttu cheu kha ring a um a nih.
"Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.","Chun, unauhai, in rênga thu hmunkhat in hril a, nangni lai inṭhena hrim a um nawna dingin, lungril hmunkhat le ngaituo hmunkhata feltaka in inzawm tlat lemna dingin ei Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin ka ngên cheu."
"For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them that are of the household of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.","Ka unauhai, in chungchâng thu chu, nangni lai insêlnahai a um ti Kloi sûnghai chun an mi hril a nih."
"Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.","Hi hi a nih ka ti chu: Mi tinin, “Kei Paula pâwl ka nih,” “Kei Appolo pâwl ka nih,” “Kei chu Kipha pâwl ka nih,” “Kei chu Krista pâwl ka nih,” in ti tâwl hi."
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?,"Krista chu ṭhein a um am a nih? Paula in aia hemdein a um am a nih? Annawleh, Paula hminga baptis- in in um am a nih?"
"I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;","Krispa le Gaia naw chu nangni lai tûkhawm ka baptis naw leiin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu ka hril hlak a nih,"
lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.,"chuong naw chun, keima hminga baptis in nih ti hril rawi an tih."
"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.","Stephan sûnghai ruok chu ka baptis bawk a, chuonghai naw chu mi dang ka baptis am ka hriet nawh."
"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.","Krista chun baptis dingin a mi tir si nawh, Chanchin Ṭha chu hril dingin a mi tir lem a nih; thu vara hril loin; chuong naw chun, Krista kraws chu iengkhawm ni loin inchangtir rawi an tih."
For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.,"Kraws thu chu bohmang zinghai ta ding chun invêtna a ni sih a, eini sandam zinghai ta ding ruok chun Pathien thilthawtheina a ni lem."
"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.","“Mi var varna chu sukbohmang ka ta, Remhre remhrietna chu peithlâng ka tih,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?,Mi var chu khâwlai am a um a? Dân hre mi khawm chu khâwlai am a um a? Hi khawvêla sêltu chu khâwlai am a um a? Pathienin khawvêl varna hi invêtthlâk a nih ti ân hriettir naw am a nih?
"For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.",Pathien varnaa chun khawvêlin varna hmanga Pathien an hmu thei naw hnungin thu hril invêt hmanga a ringtuhai sandam chu Pathienin ṭha a ti hle sih a.
"Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:","Judahai chun inchikna an phût hlak, Grik mihai khawma varna an zawng bawk hlak;"
"but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;","keini ruok chun Krista hemdea um thu chu kan hril lem hlak a ni hi; chu chu Judahai ta dingin tlûkna, Jentailhai ta dingin invêtna a nih."
"but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.","Amiruokchu, Judahai khawm ni sienla, Grikhai khawm ni sienla, kohai ta ding chun Krista Pathien thilthawtheina le Pathien varna chu a nih."
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.,"Pathien invêtna chu mihriem varna nêkin a var lem a, Pathien hrâtnawna khawm mihriem hrâtna nêkin a hrât lem sih a."
"For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:","Unauhai, a kona cheu hi ngaituo ta u, tisa tienga mi var tamtakhai, mi hrât tamtakhai, mi ṭha tamtakhai ko an ni naw zie hi;"
"but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;","nisienlakhawm, Pathienin khawvêl thil invêthai chu a thlang lem a, mi varhai chu a sukmuolpho theina dingin;"
"and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, yea and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:","chun, khawvêl thil sie le hmusitumhai, thil umnawhai chenin a thlang a, thil umsahai chu ieng- khawm ni loa a siem theina dingin;"
that no flesh should glory before God.,"chuongchun, Pathien hmaah mi tûkhawm insuong thei naw ni hai."
"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:","Nangni ruok chu ama zârah, Krista Isua chun in um a nih; ama chu Pathien kuoma inthawka ei ta dinga varnaa siem a nih, felnaa dâm, inthiengnaa dâm, intlannaa dâm leh."
"that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.","Chuongchun, an ziek ang khan, “A suong taphawt chun Lalpa chu suong raw seh.”"
"For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;","Unauhai, hieng hi in hriet naw ka nuom nawh ie, khânga ei thlatuhai po po sûm hnuoiah an um vawng a, an rênga tuisuoriet khawm an kai vawng a;"
and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;,"an rênga sûma le tuisuorieta khawm Mosie bêl dinga baptisa an um vawng a,"
and did all eat the same spiritual food;,"an rêngin thlarau tieng bu hmunkhat khawm an fâk seng a,"
and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.,an rêngin thlarau tieng dâwn ding hmunkhat khawm an dâwn seng kha; anni zuitu thlarau tieng lungpuia kha an dâwn seng kha; chu lungpui chu Krista a nih.
Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.,"Nisienlakhawm, anni laia mi tam lem chunga chun Pathien a lung- ni ta nawh a, thlalêra khan tluhlumin an um a."
"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.","Chun, chuong chu eini ta dingin inentirna a nih, thil suol an châk ang bawk khan ei châk ve nawna dingin."
"Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.","Anni laia mi ṭhenkhat milim betu an ni ang khan milim betu ni naw ro, “mipui chu fa le dâwn dingin an ṭhung tâwl a, infiem dingin an tho nâwk a,” ti ziek ang khan."
"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.","Anni laia mi ṭhenkhatin nu- nghâk an dit a, ni khata sîng hni le sâng thumin an tlûkhlum pha ang khan, in dit ve nâwng ei tiu."
"Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.","Anni laia mi ṭhenkhatin Lalpa an fieh a, rûla sukbohmanga an um pha ang khan Lalpa chu fie nâwng ei tiu."
"Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.","Anni laia ṭhenkhat an chier a, sukbohmangtu sukbohmanga an um ang khan chier naw bawk ei tiu."
"Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.","Chun, chuong chu inentirna dingin an chungah a hung tlung a ni kha; eini hun tâwp hung tlungnahai hi mi zil dingin an ziek a n i bawk a."
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.,"Chuleiin, ngîra inring chu fimkhur raw se; chuong naw chun, tlu rawi a tih."
"There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.",Mihriem ituor thei ang bâk chu thlêmna hrim hrim in chungah a tlung ngai nawh. Pathien chu a ringum a nih; ama chun in tuor thei bâk chu thlêmna in tuor phal naw ni; in tuor theina dingin thlêmna ruolin tlân suokna lampui siem nghâl lem a tih.
"Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.","Chuleichun, ka idittakhai, mi- lim biek hi tlânsan ro."
I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.,Mi varhai kuoma hril angin ka hril a nih; ka thu hril hi ngaituo ro.
"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?","Malsâwmna no mal ei isâwm hlak hi, Krista thisen inṭawmpuina a ni naw am a nih? Bei ei khawi hlak hi Krista taksa inṭawmpuina a ni naw am a nih?"
"seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.","Eini mi tamtak hi, bei tlang khat, taksa pumkhat ei ni hi; ei rêngin bei tlang khata inthawkin ei chang seng sih a."
Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?,Tisa tienga Israelhai chu en ta u; inthâwina sa fatuhai chun mâi- châm chu an inṭawmpui a ni naw am a nih?
"What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?",Ieng am a na ka hril? Milim hmaa thil inhlân chu hlutna nei thil am a nih? Milim khawm chu thil tlâktlai am a ni?
"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.","Jentailhai inthâwina chu Pathien kuomah ni loin, khawhrihai kuomah an inthâwi hlak ti ka hril lem a nih; nangnirawi chu khawhrihai in inṭawmpui ka nuompêk naw cheu a ni hi."
"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.","Lalpa no le khawhri no dâwn kawp thei naw ti niu, Lalpa dawkâna le khawhri dawkâna chu fa kawp thei naw bawk in tih."
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?,"Annawleh, Lalpa chu thîk ding- in chawk tho ei tum a ni maw? Ama nêkin ei hrât lem am a nih?"
All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.,"Thil iengkim thaw a thieng a; nisienlakhawm, thil iengkim thaw a ṭha kher nawh. Thil iengkim thaw a thieng a; nisienlakhawm, thil ieng- kim thawin a mi siem ṭha kher nawh."
"Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s good.",Tûkhawmin mâni ṭhatna ding zawng loin mi dang ṭhatna ding zawng lem raw se.
"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;",Sa dâwra an zawr taphawt chu sie le ṭha hrietna leia iengkhawm indawn loin fa el ro;
"for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.",hnuoi le a sûnga um po po hi Lalpa ta a ni sih a.
"If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.","Awinaw laia mi tuin amanih a fiel cheu a, fe in nuom si chun, sie le ṭha hrietna leiin iengkhawm indawn chuong loin an pêkhai taphawt cheu chu fa el ro."
"But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake:","Amiruokchu, tûin amanih, “Hi hi inthâwina a nih,” tiin a hril cheu chun, ân hriettirtu cheu lei le, a sie le ṭha hrietna leiin fa naw ro;"
"conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?","nang a sie le ṭha hrietna ka ti nawh a, mi dang sie le ṭha hrietna chu ka ti lem a nih. Iengdinga mi dang sie le ṭha hrietna chun ka zalênna a sawisêl am a na?"
"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?","Lâwmtaka ka chang chun, a chunga lâwmthu ka hrilna chunga hin, iengdinga hrilsieta um am ka na?"
"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.","Chuongchun, in fâk khawmin, in dâwn khawmin, in thaw taphawta chun Pathien ropuina ding ruokin thaw ro."
"Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:","Judahai ta ding khawmin, Grik mihai ta ding khawmin, Pathien kohranhai ta ding khawmin an tlûk phâna ding hrim hrim iengkhawm thaw naw ro."
"even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.","Keiin mâni ta dinga ṭangkaina zawng loa sandam an ni theina dinga mi tamtak ta dinga ṭangkaina zawng lemin, mi po po iengkimah ka suk- lâwm ang tak hin."
"Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.","Keiin Krista ka entawn angtak hin, nangni khawmin mi entawn ve ro."
"Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.","Iengkima in mi hriet zing lei le, thurosiehai ka hung hril angtaka in la vawng tlat leiin kân pâk cheu a nih."
"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.","Nisienlakhawm, pasal taphawt lu chu Krista a na, nuhmei lu chu a pasal a na, chun Krista lu chu Pathien a nih, ti in hrietchieng ka nuom a nih."
"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.","Pasal tukhawm, lukhum khum puma ṭawngṭai amani, thuhril amani phawt chun, ama lu chu a sukmuolpho a nih."
But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.,"Amiruokchu, nuhmei tukhawm, lu inkhum lova ṭawngṭai amani, thu a hril amani chun, a lu a sukmuolpho a nih, ama chu a lu mêt kawl leh thuhmun a nih."
"For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.","Nuhmeiin a lu ân khum si naw chun, a sam chu tan tâwi lem el raw se; nisienlakhawm, nuhmei ta dingin sam tan amani, mêt kawl amani chu thil inzakum a ni si leiin, a lu inkhum raw se."
"For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.","Pasal ruok chu Pathien angpui le a ropuina a ni leiin, a lu ân khum ding a ni nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu pasal ropuina suklangtu a nih."
For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:,"Pasal hi nuhmeia inthawka siem a ni nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu pasala inthawka siem a ni lem sih a."
for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:,"Pasal hi nuhmei ta dinga siem a ni nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu pasal ta dinga siem a nih."
"for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.","Vântirkohai leiin, nuhmei chu a pasal thuhnuoia um a nih ti inchikna dingin a lu ân khum ding a nih."
"Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpaa chun nuhmei hi pasal ṭhang lovin a um thei nawh a, pasal khawm nuhmei ṭhang lovin a um thei bawk nawh."
"For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.","Nuhmei hi pasala inthawka siem a ni ang bawk hin, pasal khawm chu nuhmeia inthawka pieng a ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, thil po po hi Pathiena inthawka suok vawng an nih."
Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?,Nangni ngei khan ngaituo hman ro: Nuhmeiin a lu inkhum lova Pathien kuoma a ṭawngṭai hi a âwm rêng rêng am a ni?
"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?","Pasalin sam sei a put chun, a ta dingin thil inzakum a nih ti in piengpui lungril khawmin ân hriettir naw cheu am a ni?"
"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.","Nuhmeiin a sam a hla sei ruok chun, chu chu ama ropuina a nih, a sam chu inkhumna dinga pêk a ni sih a."
"But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.","Tukhawmin, hi thu hi a lo sêl a ni khawmin, chuong thila chun keinîn thawdân kan nei nawh a, Pathien kohranhai khawma an nei bawk nawh."
"But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.","Amiruokchu, hieng thil inchûktirnahaia hin chu kân pâk thei naw cheu a nih, in inkhâwm pha ṭhatpui nêkin in sietpui lem hlak leiin."
"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.","A hmasatakin, kohran anga in inkhâwm chângin nangni lai inṭhena a um hlak ti thu ka lo hriet sih a; iemani chenah ka ring deu bawk a nih."
"For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.",Nangni laia mi indiktakhai an inlang theina dingin pâwl tum tum an hung um ding hrim a nih.
"When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:","In fe khâwm phaa in fâk hlak hi, Lalpa zânbu a ni naw tawp el."
"for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.","Fâk hun a tlung pha leh, mi tinin mani bu seng in lo fâk el hlak sih a, chuongchun pakhat phîngṭâmin a um a, pakhat ân rui hlak."
"What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.","Ieng am an ta leh! Fâk le dâwnna dingin in in nei seng an naw am a ni? Annawleh, Pathien kohran hmusitin, iengkhawm nei nawhai chu in sukzak el hlak am a ni? In kuomah ieng am ka hril ding a na? Kân pâk ding cheu am a ni? Hi thila hin chun kân pâk thei naw cheu."
"For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;","Ka thu hril sâwng cheu kha Lalpa kuoma inthawka ka dawng a na; khânga inmantira a um zân khan, Lalpa Isûn, bei a lâk a,"
"and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.","lâwmthu a hril zovin, a khawi a, “Hi hi ka taksa, in ta ding chu a nih. In mi hriet zingna dingin hi hi thaw hlak ro,” a ti kha."
"In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.","Chuong ang bawkin, zânbu fâk zovin, no khawm chu a lâk a, “Hi hi ka thisena Thuthlung Thar chu a nih. In dâwn povin in mi hriet zingna dingin thaw hlak ro,” a ti kha."
"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.","Chu bei chu in fâk a, no chu in dâwn zâtin, Lalpa hung nâwk hmakhat a thina chu in puong hlak a ni sih a."
"Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.","Chuleiin, tukhawm tlâklo puma bei chu faa, Lalpa no chu dâwn taphawt chun, Lalpa taksa le thisen chungah suol-maw phur a tih."
"But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.","Mi tin mani infie seng sienla, chuong ang chun bei chu fain no chu dâwn raw se."
"For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.","A fatu le a dâwntu chun, Lalpa taksa chîktaka a ngaituo si naw chun, ama chunga rorêlna intlun dingin a fâkin a dâwn a ni sih a."
"For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.","Hi lei hin nangni laia tamtak chu, in hrâtnawin in hrivawi a sie a nih, ṭhenkhat chu in thi tah a."
"But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.","Amiruokchu, chîktakin inngaituo hlak unla chu, ro rêlpêkin ei um naw ding bah."
"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.","Rorêlpêka ei um khawmin, khawvêl mihai anga thiemnaw changa ei um nawna dingin Lalpa thununin ei um hlak a nih."
"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.","Chuleiin, ka unauhai, fa dinga in inkhâwm pha, innghâk tâwl hlak ro."
"If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.","In inkhâwm chu thiemnaw in chang phana a ni nawna dingin, a phîngṭâm chun inah hung fa zet raw se. Thil danghai chungchâng chu ka hung pha leh la kâwkhmûng ka ti cheu."
"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.","Chun, unauhai, thlarau tieng thilpêk thuhai chu in hriet naw ka nuom nawh."
"Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.","Awinawhai in ni lai khan, ieng ang khawma an ṭhuoi ang pei cheu khan, khâng milim rawl neilo tienga khan ṭhuoihmangin in um ti in hriet a."
"Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.","Chuleiin, tûkhawmin Pathien thlaraua thu hrilin, “Isu chu ṭawng- sephur a nih,” an ti ngai nawh; chun, tûkhawmin Thlarau Inthienga chau naw chun, “Isu chu Lalpa a nih,” an ti thei ngai nawh ti kân hriettir cheu."
"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.","Chun, thilpêk chu a tum tum a um a, Thlarau chu hmunkhat a nih."
"And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.","Rawngbâwl dân tum tum khawm a um a; nisienlakhawm, Lalpa chu hmunkhat a nih."
"And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.","Sinthaw dân tum tum khawm a um a, Pathien ruok chu hmunkhat a nih, mi po poa iengkim thawtu chu."
But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.,"Chun, ṭhathnempui tlâng seng dingin Thlarau inhriettirna chu mi tin kuomah pêk seng a nih."
"For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:",Mi pakhat kuomah Thlaraua chun varna thu pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah chu Thlarau thu ma chun hrietna pêk a nih;
"to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;","chun, mi dang kuomah chu Thlaraua bawk chun, ringna pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah Thlarau thuhmuna chun sukdam theina pêk a nih;"
and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:,"mi dang kuomah thilmak thaw- theina pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah thuhril theina pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah thlarauhai hriet dik theina pêk a nih; chun, mi dang kuomah ṭawng hrietlo chi dang danghaia thuhril theina pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah ṭawng hrietlohai hrilfie theina pêk a ni sih a;"
"but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.","nisienlakhawm, chuong po po chu Thlarau thuhmun bawk chun, mi tin kuomah a nuom ang peia semin sin a thaw hlak."
"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.","Taksa hi pakhat a na, pêng tamtak a nei a, taksa pênghai po po chu tam hai sienkhawm taksa pum- khat an ni sih a; Krista chu chuong ang bawk chu a nih."
"For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.","Ei rêngin, Judahai amanih, Grikhai amanih, suok amanih, suok nilo amanih taksa pumkhata um dingin, Thlarau pakhat chauah bap- tisin ei um seng sih a. Thlarau pakhat chau bawk a mîn dâwntir bawk a."
"For the body is not one member, but many.","Taksa hi pêng khat chau a ni si nawh a, pêng tamtak a ni lem."
"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.","Kepha hin, “Kut ka ni naw leiin taksaa ṭhang ka ni nawh,” ti sienla, chu lei chun taksaa ṭhang naw a ni chuong nawh."
"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.","Chun, nakâwr hin, “Mit ka ni naw leiin taksaa ṭhang ka ni nawh” ti sienla, chu lei chun taksaa ṭhang naw a ni chuong nawh."
"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?","Taksa pumpui hi mit ni vawng ta sienla, ri hrietna chu khâwlai am ni tâng a ti leh? A pumin ri hrietna ni vawng ta sienla, rim hriet theina chu khâwlai am ni tâng a ti leh?"
"But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin pêng tin hi taksaah a nuomna poah ân umtir seng tah a nih."
"And if they were all one member, where were the body?","Chuongchun, chuong po po chu pêng khat chau ni sienla, taksa hi khâwlai am um a ta?"
"But now they are many members, but one body.","Amiruokchu, pêng tamtak an ni lem a; nisienlakhawm, taksa pum- khat chau a ni sih a."
"And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.","Chun, mit hin kut kuomah, “Ienga khawm hmangna ka nei naw che,” a ti thei nawh; lu khawm hin kephahai kuomah, “Ienga khawm hmangna ka nei naw cheu,” a ti thei bawk nawh."
"Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:","Anih, chuong nêk hmanin taksa pêng hrât âwm loa inlanghai hi an pawimaw lem bêk bêk a nih;"
"and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness;","chuongchun, taksa pêng chawi- mawi tlâk naw lema ei ruothai hi, chuong ngei chu ei chawimawi nasa lem hlak; chuongchun, ei pêng mawinawhai hin mawina nasa lem an hmu hlak;"
"whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked;","ei pêng mawi lemhai ruok chun chuong anga thaw chu an ngai nawh; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin mawina neinaw pêng chu chawimawi nasa lemin taksa hi a rem khâwm a nih;"
that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.,"taksaa hin inṭhena hrim um loa, pênghai hin inangtaka an inbuoipui tuo seng theina dingin."
"And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.","Chuongchun, pêng khatin a tuor chun, pêng po poin an tuorpui hlak, pêng khat chawimawia a um chun, pêng po poin an lâwmpui hlak."
"Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.","Chuongchun, nangnirawi hi Krista taksa chu in nih, a pênghai in ni seng bawk a."
"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues.","Chun, Pathienin ṭhenkhat chu kohran lai a sieh a, pakhatnaa chun tirkohai, a pahninaa chun thuhriltu- hai, a pathumnaa chun inchûktir- tuhai a sie a, chu hnunga chun thilmak thawhai an um a, chu zoa chun sukdam theina thilpêkhai, ṭhangpui theina thilpêkhai, rorêl thiemna thilpêkhai, ṭawng hrietlo chi tum tuma thuhril theina thilpêkhai a um nâwk a."
Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?,An rêngin tirko an ni vawng am a nih? An rêngin thuhriltu an ni vawng am a nih? An rêngin inchûktirtu an ni vawng am a nih? An rêngin thilmak thawtu an ni vawng am a nih?

But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.,"Thilpêka ropuitakhai chu châk hle lem ro. Chun, tuhin kawng ṭha nâwk zuol inentir ka ti cheu."
"If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.","Mihriem ṭawnghai le vântirko ṭawnghaiin thu hril lang khawm, hmangaina ka nei si naw chun dâr inri mei mei amanih, dârbenthek inri mei mei amanih lo nîng ka tih."
"And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.","Chun, thu hril theina neiin, thurûk po po le hrietna po po hre vawng lang khawm, tlâng sawn theina khawp hiel ringna famkim nei lang khawm, hmangaina ka nei si naw chun iengkhawm ni naw ning."
"And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.","Chun, mi rimsihai châwmna dingin ka sum po po khawm pe vawng lang, ka taksa khawm kâng dingin inpe lang hmangaina ka nei si naw chun, ka ta dingin iengkhawm ṭhahnem naw ni."
"Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,","Hmangaina chu a dawthei a, ngil a nei a, hmangainain a îtthîk nawh a; hmangaina ama le ama ân pak ngai nawh a, a uong nawh a,"
"doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;","a châng mawinaw ngai nawh a, mâni hma a siel nawh a, a lunginsen nuom nawh a, suol tiengah a ngaituo nawh a,"
"rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;","felnawna a lâwm nawh a, thutak ruok chu a lâwmpui hlak;"
"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.","iengkim a tuor hrâm hrâm a, iengkim a ring a, iengkim a beisei a, iengkim a tuor suo hlak."
"Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away.","Hmangaina hi iengtik khawm bo naw nih a; amiruokchu, thuhrilna dâm hi um sienla khawm sukbân la nîng a tih; ṭawng hrietlohai dâm hi um sien khawm la mâng a tih, hrietna hi um sienkhawm sukbân la nîng a tih."
"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;","A kim loin ei hriet a, a kim loin thu ei hril bawk hlak a nih;"
"but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.",a famkim a hung tlung pha ruok chun a kimnaw hi bân ni tâng a tih.
"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.","Ka naupang laiin naupang angin ka ṭawng a, naupang hrietin ka hriet a, naupang ngaituo angin ka ngaituo hlak; tuta ka hung puitling hnung hin naupang thaw dân chu ka bân tah."
"For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.","Tuhin chu hlimenah ei hmu rei ruoi a nih, chu chu pha ruok chun inhmatuoin ni tâng a tih. Tuhin chu a kim loin ei hriet a, chu pha ruok chun hriet kim ka ni ang bawk hin hre kim tâng ka tih."
"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.","Chuongchun, hienghai pathum, ringna dâm, beiseina dâm, hmangaina dâm hi um zing a tih; chun, a hi poa a ropuitak chu hmangaina hi a nih."
"Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.","Hmangaina hi hnawt pei unla, Thlarau tieng thilpêk chu châk hle ro; amiruokchu, thu in hril theina ding lem chun châk bîk ro."
"For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.","Ṭawng hrietloa thuhril chun mihriem kâwla hril ni loin, Pathien kuomah a hril lem a ni sih a; tûkhawmin a thuhril chu an hriet si nawh a; nisienlakhawm, thlarau chun thurûk a hril a nih."
"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.","Thuhriltu ruok chun mihriem kuomah siem ṭhatna thu dâm, infui- na thu dâm, thlamuongna thu dâm a hril lem hlak."
He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.,Ṭawng hrietloa thu hril chun ama chau ân siem ṭha hlak. Thuhriltu ruok chun kohran a siem ṭha hlak.
"Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.","Chun, in rênga ṭawng hrietlohaia thu in hril ka nuompêk cheu; nisien- lakhawm, thu in hril ka nuompêk nâwk zuol cheu a nih; kohranin insiemṭhatna an hmu theina dingin a hrilfie nâwk nghâl naw chun, thu hriltu chu ṭawng hrietloa thu hriltu nêk chun a ropui lem hrim hrim a nih."
"But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?","Tuhin, unauhai, ṭawng hriet- lohaia thu hrilin in kuomah hung ta ang lang, inhriettirna tieng amanih, hrietna tieng amanih, thu hrilna tieng amanih, inchûktirna tieng ama- nih in kuomah ka hril si naw chun ieng am ka sukṭhathnemna ding cheu a um a?"
"Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?","Thil hringna neilo, inri theihai khawm theihle amanih, ṭingṭang amanih, a mumal neia ân ri naw chun, ieng hla inzuiin am an keia ti iengtin am inhriet thei a ti leh?"
"For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?",Tawtawrâwt hi mumal nei loa ân ri chun tu am râl kâp dingin inbuotsai an ta?
"So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.","Chuong ang bawkin nangni khawm lei hin ṭawng hriet awla in hril naw chun ieng ang thu am in hril a, ti iengtin am inhriet thei a ta? Boruoka ṭawng mei mei nîng in tih in sawnnaw."
"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification.","Khawvêla hin ṭawng ri chi tum tamtak a um a ni thei a; nisien- lakhawm, umzie nei naw hrim hrim a um si nawh a."
"If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.","A ṭawng ri umzie ruok chu ka hriet naw chun, kei chu a hriltu ta ding chun ram dang mi nîng ka ta; a hriltu khawm chu ka ta dingin ram dang mi ni bawk a tih."
"So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.","Chuongchun, nangni khawmin, thlarau thilpêk chungah ṭhahnem in ngai leiin kohran siemṭhat theina dinga in hausak theina dingin zawng ro."
Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.,"Chuleiin, ṭawng hrietloa thu hril chun, a hrilfie theina dingin ṭawngṭai raw se."
"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.","Ṭawng hrietloa ka ṭawngṭai chun ka thlarau chun chu a ṭawngṭai ngei a, ka hrietna ruok chu a hlâwk chuong nawh."
"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.","Iengtin am ni tâng a ti leh? Thlarauin, ṭawngṭai ka ta, hrietthei- na khawmin ṭawngṭai bawk ka tih; thlarauin hla sak ka ta, hriettheina khawmin sak bawk ka tih."
"Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?","Chuong naw chun, thlarauin malsâwmpêk la khawm, a hrenawhai umnaa um chun i lâwmthu hrila chun iengtin am “Amen” ti thei a ta, i thu hril chu hre thei naw sain?"
"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.","Nang chun chu lâwmthu i hril ṭha takzet a, mi dang ruok chu a siemṭha chuong si nawh."
"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:","Nangni po po nêka ṭawng hrietloa thu ka hril rawn lem leiin, Pathien kuomah lawmthu ka hril a;"
"howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.","nisienlakhawm, kohran in- khâwmnaa chun, ṭawng hrietloa thu sîng khat hril nêk chun, mi danghai kân chûktir theina dingin ka hriettheinaa thu panga chau hril ka nuom lem."
"Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.","Unauhai, lungril tieng naupang naw ro; nisienlakhawm, suol kawnga chu nautê ang ni unla, lungril tienga chun puitling ro."
"In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.","Dân Lekhabua chun, “ ‘ṭawng dang mihai bau le, ram dang mihai hmûrin, hieng mihai kuoma hin thu hril ka ta; chuong sa khawm chun mi ngainaw ni hai,’ Lalpain a tih,” ti ziek a nih."
"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.","Chuleiin, ṭawng hrietlohai hi awihai ta ding chun inchikna a ni nawh a, awinawhai ta ding a ni lem; thu hril ruok hi chu, awinawhai ta dingin inchikna a ni nawh a, awihai ta dingin a ni lem."
"If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?","Chuleiin, kohran po po in- khâwm unla, in rênga ṭawng hriet- lohaia thu in hril chun a la hrenawhai amanih, awinawhai amani hung lût hai sienla, invêt an ti naw ding cheu am a nih?"
"But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;","In rêngin thu inhril ruok chun, awinaw amanih, la hrelo amanih hung lût sien la, a thiemnawzie in rênga suklang ni tâng a tih; in rênga suosal ni tâng a tih;"
"the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.","a lungril thurûk chu phawr nîng a ta, chuongchun, bawkkhupin Pathien chibai bûk a ta, Pathien nangni lai a um takzet ti hril a tih."
"What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.","Unauhai, iengtin am ni tâng a ta? In hung inkhâwmin inpâkna hla amanih, thu inchûktirna amanih, inhriettirna amanih, ṭawng hrietlo amanih, hrilfiena amanih in nei seng hlak. Iengkim siem ṭhatna dingin thaw ni raw se."
"If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret:","Tukhawmin ṭawng hrietloa thu an hril chun, pahniin amanih, a tam- takah pathumin amanih ni sienla, insâwk peiin ni bawk raw se; chun, mi pakhatin hrilfie raw se."
"but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.","Hrilfietu an um naw chun, kohran inkhâwmnaa chun to zingin um hai sienla, mâni le Pathien kuomah hril raw se."
"And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.","Thuhriltuhai khawmin, pahniin amanih, pathumin amanih, hril sienla, mi danghai chun nguntakin ngaituo raw hai se."
"But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.","Amiruokchu, a kâwla ṭhung mi dang kuomah inhriettirna thu pêkin a hung um chun, a hmasa chu to el raw se."
"For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;","Mi po poin an inchûk theina ding le, mi po po lungmuonga an um theina dingin pakhat peiin thu in hril thei sih a."
and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;,Thuhriltuhai thlarauhai chu thuhriltuhai thununin an um a nih.
"for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,","Pathien chu buoina Pathien a ni nawh a, inremna Pathien a ni lem sih a. Mi inthieng kohranhai po poa ang hin,"
"let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.",kohran inkhâwmnahaia chun nuhmeihai chu to zingin um raw hai se; anni chu an thu hril phal a ni si nawh a; Dân Lekhabuin a hril ang bawk khan thu zâwmin um lem raw hai se.
"And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.","Chun, iengkhawm inchûk an nuom chun, in tieng an pasalhai in- dawn raw hai se; kohran inkhâwm- naa nuhmei thu hril inzak a um sih a."
What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?,"Pathien thu hi nangnia inthawk- a suok a ni maw? Annawleh, nangni kuom chaua hung tlung a ni maw?"
"If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.","Tûkhawm thu hriltu amanih, thlarau mi amanih nia ân ngai chun in kuoma thu ka ziek hi Lalpa thupêk a ni ti lo hre raw se."
"But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin hi hi a hriet nuom naw chun ama chu hriet loin um raw se."
"Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.","Chuleiin, ka unauhai, thu hril hi inhâwk hle unla, ṭawng hrietlohaia thu hril khawm khap naw ro;"
But let all things be done decently and in order.,"nisienlakhawm, iengkim mawi- tak le feltaka thaw ni raw se."
"Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,","Chun, unauhai, Chanchin Ṭha ka hril cheu kha inhriettir nâwk ka ti cheu; chu Chanchin Ṭha chu in lâwm a, chutaka bawk chun in ngîr a;"
"by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.","ka thu hril cheu kha in awi mei mei a ni nawh a, in pawm tlat a ni chun, chutaka bawk chun sandam mêkin in um a nih."
For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;,"A hmasatakin, ka ihmu ve bawk chu ka hril sâwng cheu kha; khânga Krista chu Pathien Lekha thu hril ang peia ei suolhai leia a thi a,"
and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;,"an phûm a, Pathien Lekha thu ang peiin ni thum nia keithoin a um a."
and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;,"Kipha kuomah a hung inlâr dâm kha; chun, sâwm le pahnihai kuomah ân lâr nâwk a."
"then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;",Chu hnunga chun unau za nga nêka tam lai ân lâr nawk a; chuhai laia mi tam lem chu tu chen hin an la dam rawp a; ṭhenkhat ruok chu an in tah a.
then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;,"Chun, Jakob kuomah ân lâr nâwk a, chu hnung chun tirkohai po po kuomah;"
"and last of all, as to the child untimely born, he appeared to me also.","chun, a tâwptaka chun, a hun nawa pieng ang keima kuoma khawm ân lâr a."
"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.","Kei chu tirko laia chîntak, Pathien kohranhai ka suknawmna leia tirkoa inbûk tlâklo ka ni sih a."
"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien lung- insietna leiin ka ni ni ka ni tah; chun, a lunginsietna a mi pêk chu a thlâwnin a um nawh a, chuong nêk hmanin anni po po nêkin ka thaw nasa lem kha; nisienlakhawm, keia khâtin ka thaw nawh a, Pathien lunginsietna ka kuoma um khan a thaw lem a nih."
"Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, kei khawmin, anni khawmin khâng ang khan kan hril hlak a, nangniin khâng khan in awi bawk a."
"Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?","Chun, Krista thu: mithi laia inthawka keithoin a um ti an hril si chun, iengtiziea nangni laia ṭhen- khatin “Mithi thonâwkna hrim hrim a um nawh” in ti?"
"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:",Mithi thonâwkna hrim hrim a um naw chun Krista khawm kha keithoin um naw ni;
"and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.","chun, Krista chu keithoa a um si naw chun, kan thu hril hi iengkhawm ni naw nih a, in awi khawm ieng- khawm ni naw ni."
"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.","Anih, Krista a keitho ti Pathien kan hrietpui lei khan, Pathien tieng thuah hrietpuitu khelhlip lo ni bawk kan tih — Mithihai keithoa an um naw chun, ama khawm keitho da ni ie."
"For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:","Mithihai keithoin an um si naw chun, Krista khawm kha keithoin um si naw ni,"
"and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.","chun, Krista kha keithoa a um naw chun, in iâwi chu iengkhawm ni naw ni, in suolnaa chun in la um zing nîng a tih."
Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.,"Chuong chu a ni chun, Kristaa in tahai kha an bohmang tah nîng a tih."
"If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.",Tulai dam sûng chaua Krista chunga beiseina nei ei ni chun mi po poa lungsietumtak lo nîng ei tih.
"But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.","Nisienlakhawm, Krista chu mithi laia inthawkin keithoin a um tak zet a nih, a inhai tho hmaṭhuoitu a lo ni tah."
"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.",Mihriem leia thina a lo um leiin mihriem lei bawkin mithi thonâwkna a lo um ta bawk a.
"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.","Adama chun mi po po an thi hlak angin, Kristaa chun mi po po sukhringin um bawk an tih."
"But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.","Nisienlakhawm, mâni hun seng peiah, keitho ning an tih: ahmasa takin Krista, tho hmathuoitu; chu hnungah, a hung phaleh Ama tahai po."
"Then cometh the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.","Chu hnunga chun a tâwp chu la hung tlung a tih, chu pha chun rorêlnahai po po le thuneina thil- thawtheina po pohai a sukbo hnungin, Pathien kuomah, Pa kuoma ngei chun ram chu pêng a tih;"
"For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.",a hmêlmahai po po a ke hnuoia a sie hmakhat chu ama chu lala um ding hrim a ni sih a.
The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.,Hmêlma nuhnungtak sukboa um ding chu thina hi a nih.
"For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.","“Ama chun a ke hnuoiah iengkim a sie sih a”; nisienlakhawm, “A hnuoiah iengkim siein a um”, ti hin, a hnuoia iengkim sietu chu a ṭhang ve nawh ti ân lang zing a nih."
"And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.","Chun, a hnuoia iengkim siea a um pha chun, Naupa ngei khawm chu a hnuoia iengkim sietu hnuoia siein um bawk a tih, Pathien chu iengkima iengkim a ni theina dingin."
"Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?","Chuong ang a ni naw chun, mithi puola baptisma changhai chu iengtin am thâwng an ta? Mithihai chu keithoa an um dêr si naw ding chun, iengdinga anni puola baptisma an chang hlak?"
why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?,Iengleiin am eini khawm hi dârkâr tina inlaua ei um hlak am a na?
"I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.","Unauhai, ei Lalpa Isu Kristaa ka suongna cheu chu sâlin, “Ni tinin ka thi hlak,” ka ti a nih."
"If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.","Mihriem thaw dân ang ringawt- a Ephesia sahrânghai kha insuolpui ka ni chun, ka ta dingin ieng am ṭhahnem a ta? mithi keithoa an um naw ding chun, fain dâwn ei tiu, zîngah ei thi el ding annâwm."
Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.,"Hlêmin um naw ro, “Ruol rilo- haiin nungchang ṭha an suk- khawhlo hlak.”"
"Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak this to move you to shame.","Feltakin har unla, suksuol naw ro; ṭhenkhat chun Pathien hrietna hrim in nei naw hi; hi hi in inzakna dinga ka hril a nih."
"But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?","Nisienlakhawm, tuin amanih, “Mithi hai chu iengtin am keithoin um an ta? taksa ieng ang putin am hung an ta?” a ti a ni thei a."
"Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:","Nang mi invêt, nang ngeiin i tu hlak khawm hi, a thi zet naw chun sukhringin a um ngai lem,"
"and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;","chun, i tu hlak khawm hi a taksa la um ding chu i tu nawh a, a mal el i tu lem hlak a, bu mal amanih, chi dang mal amani khawm a ni thei a;"
"but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.","nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ama nuom ang peiin taksa a pêk hlak, a mal tin kuomah mani taksa seng chu."
"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.","Tisa po po hi tisa chi khat an ni nawh a; mihriem tisa a dang a, sa tisa a dang a, vate tisa a dang a, nga tisa a dang a nih."
"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.","Vân taksahai a um a, hnuoi taksahai khawm; nisienlakhawm, vân taksa ropuina chu a dang a, hnuoi taksa ropuina chu a dang a nih."
"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.","Nisa ropuina chu a dang a, thla ropuina chu a dang a, arasihai ropui- na chu a dang a, arasi le arasi khawm ropuinaa chun an inang si nawh."
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:,"Mithi thonâwkna khawm hi chuong ang bawk chu a nih. Hmawn theia tuin a um a, hmawntheiloa keithoin a um;"
it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:,"chawimawiloa tuin a um a, ropuitaka keithoin a um; hrâtloa tuin a um a, thilthawtheina neia keithoin a um;"
"it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.","mihriem tieng taksaa tuin a um a, Thlarau tieng taksaa keithoin a um, mihriem tieng taksa a um chun thlarau tieng taksa khawm um a tih."
"So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.","Chuong ang bawkin, “Mihriem hmasatak Adam chu mi hring a hung nih,” ti ziek a nih; Adam nuhnung lem chu hringna petu thlarau a nih."
"Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.","Nisienlakhawm, thlarau tieng chu a um hmasa nawh a, mihriem tieng chu a um hmasa lem; chu hnunga chun thlarau tieng chu a um."
"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.",Mihriem hmasatak chu hnuoia mi pila siem a nih; mihriem pahnina chu vâna mi a nih.
"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.","Hnuoia siem mi ang kha, hnuoia siem mihai khawm hi an nih; vâna mi ang kha vân mihai khawm chu an nih."
"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.","Chun, hnuoia siem mi puona kha ei nei ang bawkin vâna mi puona chu ei nei bawk ding a nih."
"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.","Unauhai, “Tisa le thisen hin Pathien ram hluo thei naw nih a, hmawn thei hin hmawntheilo chu hluo chuong bawk naw ni” ti ka hril a ni hi."
"Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,","Ngai ta u, thurûk ka hril ding cheu a ni hi; ei rêngin in kher nâwm ei nih a,"
"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.","nisienlakhawm, ei rêngin tawtawrâwt nuhnungtak inri pha chun sâwt nawtêa, mitkhap kâr loa sukdanglamin um vawng tâng ei tih; tawtawrâwt chu ân ri ding a ni sih a; chuongchun, mithihai chu hmawn- theiloa keithoin um an ta, eini khawm sukdanglamin um tâng ei tih."
"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.","Hi hmawnthei hin hmawntheilo a sil ding a na, hi thi thei khawm hin thi theinawna a sil bawk ding a nih."
"But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.","Chuongchun, hi hmawnthei hin hmawntheinawna a sila, hi thithei hin thitheinawna a sil pha chun, “Hnenain thina a lem zo tah,”"
"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?","“Aw thina, i hnena chu khâwlai am a um tah a? Aw thina, i tûr chu khâwlai am a um tah a?” ti thuziek hi hung tlung tâng a tih."
The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:,"Thina tûr chu suol a na, suol thilthawtheina chu dân thu chu a nih."
"but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, ei Lalpa Isu Krista zâra hnena mi petu Pathien kuoma chun lawmthu um raw se."
"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.","Chuleichun, ka unau dittakhai, dettakin, sukchâng ruolloin Lalpa sin ṭhahnem ngaitaka thaw rawpin um ro, in inrimna chu Lalpaa chun a thlâwn ngai nawh ti in hriet sih a."
"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.","Chun, mi inthienghai ta dinga thawlâwm thu kha chu, Galati rama kohran hai kuomah thu ka pêk angin nangni khawmin lo thaw ve ro."
"Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.","Ni saria ni hmasatak peia chun mi tinin, malsâwmna in hmu zie ang peiin siekhâwl seng unla, ka hung phaa thawlâwm dâwl hrim a um nawna dingin."
"And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:","Chun, in lunginsietna thilpêk chu Jerusalema fepui dingin ka hung tlung phaleh tûkhawm ṭha in ti ti lekhahai chawiin tir ka tih."
"and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.","Chun, ka fe vena âwm a ni lem chun, kei leh fêng an tih."
"But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;","Chun, Makedonia ram ka fang suok hnungin in kuomah hung ka tih: Makedonia ram chu ka fang hrim hrim ding a ni sih a."
"but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.","Nangni kuoma ruok chu ka châm zing a ni thei, thlasik sûng po khawm a ni el thei; khâwlai khawm ka fena taphawta nangniin in mîn thla theina dingin."
"For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.","Tuta fe malam ela hmu cheu ka nuom nawh a, Lalpain rem a ti chun in kuoma sâwt deu châm ka beisei sih a."
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;,"Nisienlakhawm, Pentikost chen Ephesia hin châm zing ka tih,"
"for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.","kawtkhâr lientak le ṭangkai tak chu ka ta dingin ân hawng sih a, dotuhai tamtak an um bawk."
"Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:","Chun, Timothe kha a hung tlung chun ṭi loa in kuoma a umna dingin fîmkhur ro; keiin ka thaw ang bawkin Lalpa sin chu a thaw sih a."
"let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.","Chuleiin, tûkhawmin hmusit naw raw se; ka kuoma a hung theina dingin thlamuongtakin inthla lem ro, unauhai ruolin ama lo hmu ka beisei sih a."
"But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.","Ei unau Appolo thu kha chu, unauhai ruola in kuoma hung dingin ka ngên rak a, ana chu, tuta ṭum chu hung a nuom naw tawp el; a remchâng pha ruok chu hung a tih."
"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.","Invêng unla, ringnaa chun ngîr det unla, insukhuoi unla, hrâttakin um ro,"
Let all that ye do be done in love.,In thaw taphawt chu hmangai- naa thaw ni raw se.
"Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),","Unauhai, ka ngên cheu a nih: Stephan sûnghai chu Akaia rama awihai hmaṭhuoitu an na, mi inthienghai rawng bâwl dingin an inpêk ti in hriet a,"
"that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.",chuong ang mihai kuoma le sinthawa ṭhangpui le sin inrim taphawt kuoma chun intuklût dingin.
And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.,"Chun, Stephan hai, Phortunata hai, Akaika hai an hung hi ka lâwm a nih, in um naw khawm inlang loa an mi siem lei hin."
For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.,"Anni hin ka lungril le nangni lungril an mi sukhar sih a; chuongchun, hieng ang mi hi lâwm ro."
"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.","Asia ram kohranhai hin chibai an bûk cheu. Akuila le Priskilla, an ina kohran inkhawmhai le hin Lalpaa chun chibai tamtakin an bûk cheu."
All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.,Unau po po hin chibai an bûk cheu. Infâwp inthiengin chibai inbûk seng ro.
The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.,Kei Paulain keima kut ngeia chibai ka bûkna cheu a ni hi.
"If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.",Tûkhawmin Lalpa a hmangai naw chun ṭawngsephurin um raw se. Ei Lalpa chu a hung ie.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.,Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna chu in kuomah um raw se.
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.,Krista Isua ka hmangaina hi in rênga kuomah um raw se. Amen.
"And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.","Chun, kei chu unauhai, Pathien thurûk hril cheuva in kuoma ka hung lai khan ka thu hril ropui le varna ropui le hung ka ni nawh a,"
"For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",Isu Krista ama ngei hemdea a um thu chau naw chu nangni lai ieng dang khawm hriet ka tum nawh kha.
"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.","Chun, hrâtnaw le ṭiin, nasataka inthin pumin in kuomah ka um a."
"And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:","Ka ṭawngbau suok le ka thu hrilhai chu thu vara thlêmna thu a ni nawh a, Thlarau le thilthawtheina inhriettirin a ni lem kha;"
"that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.","in ringna chu mihriem varnaa innghat loa, Pathien thilthawtheinaa innghata a um lemna dingin."
"We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:","Amiruokchu, puitlinghai lai chu thu var kan hril hlak; nisien- lakhawm, hi khawvêl thu var chu a ni nawh, hi khawvêl rorêltu bohmang dinghai thu var chu a ni bawk nawh;"
"but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:","Pathien thu var thurûk chu kan hril lem hlak a nih, thu var inthup, ei ropuina dinga Pathienin khawvêl um hmaa a ruot lâwk ta chu."
"which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:","Chu chu hi khawvêl rorêltuhai hrim hrimin an hriet nawh, hre hai sien chu ropuina Lalpa chu hemde naw ni hai."
"but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.","“Mita hmu ngai naw le naa hriet ngai naw, Mihriem lungrila lût ngai naw, Pathienin ama hmangaituhai ta dinga A buotsai taphawt chu,” ti ziek ang lem khan."
"But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.","Keini ruok chu chuong chu Pathienin Thlarauin a mîn hriettir tah a nih; Thlarau chun iengkim a suisuok hlak sih a; anih, Pathien thu inril khawm."
"For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.","Mihriem thuhai chu mihriem lungril, a sûnga um bawk naw chun tuin am hrieng a ta? Chuong ang bawkin Pathien thuhai chu Pathien Thlarau bawk naw chun tûkhawmin an hriet nawh."
"But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.","Chuongchun, a thlâwna Pa- thien thil mi pêkhai chu ei hriet theina dingin, eini chun khawvêl thlarau ni loin, Thlarau Pathien kuoma inthawk chu ei hmu lem a nih."
"Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual words.","Mihriem varna inchûktir thua hril loin, Thlarau inchûktir thua hril lemin Thlarau tieng thuhai chu thlarau tieng mihai kuoma hrilfiein, chuong thil a mi pêkhai thu khawm chu kan hril hlak."
"Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.","Khawvêl mi chun Pathien Thlarau thil chu a lâwm ngai nawh, ama ngaia chun invêtthlâk a ni sih a; Thlaraua hriet chieng a ni leiin a hriet thei naw hrim a nih."
"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.","Thlarau mi ruok chun thil iengkim a hriet chieng hlak, ama hlak chu tûkhawmin an hriet chieng si nawh."
"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",Tûin am Lalpa lungril hre taa ama inchûktir thei ding? Eini ruok chun Krista lungril ei put a nih.
"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.","Chun, unauhai, Thlarau mi kuoma hril angin in kuomah thu ka hril thei nawh a, tisa mihai kuoma hril angin ka hril lem kha; Kristaa nautêhai kuoma hril ang elin."
"I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able;","Bu ni loin, nênetuiin ka châwm cheu kha, bu in la fâk thei naw leiin; anih, tu khawm hin in la fâk thei naw rawp a nih, tisa mi in la ni rawp leiin."
"for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?",Nangni laia inthîkna le insêlna a um hlak leiin tisa mi la niin mihriem angin in la um zing a ni naw am a nih?
"For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?","Mi pakhatin, “Paula pâwl ka nih,” mi dangin, “kei chu Appolo pâwl ka nih,” in ti sûng chu mihriem in ni zing a ni naw am a ni?"
What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.,Appolo chu ieng am a ni leh? Paula khawm chu ieng am a na? Rawngbâwltu nangni inawitirtu cheu chau an nih in sawnnaw; chu khawm chu Lalpain a ipêk ang ve ve chau a nih.
"I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.","Keiin ka phun a, Appoloin tuiin a châwm a, nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ân ṭhangtir a nih."
"So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.","Chuongchun, ân ṭhangtirtu Pathien chau naw chu a phuntu chu iengkhawm a ni nawh a, tuia châwm- tu khawm chu iengkhawm a ni nawh."
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.,"Chun, a phuntu le tuia châwmtu pumkhat an nih, nisienlakhawm, mâni sinthaw ang peiin lâwmman hmu ve vêng an tih."
"For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.","Keini chu Pathien sinthaw- puituhai kan ni sih a, nangni Pathien lohma chu in na, Pathien in bâwl chu in ni bawk a nih."
"According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.","Pathien lunginsietna ka kuoma pêka um ang peiin in bâwl hotu tak vartak angin keiin lungphûm ka rem a, mi dangin a chungah in an bâwl a, nisienlakhawm, mi tin a chunga bawl dingziea chun fimkhur seng raw hai se."
"For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.","Lungphûm rem tasa naw chu tûkhawma lungphûm dang an rem thei si naw a, chu lungphûm chu Isu Krista chu a nih."
"But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;","Chun, lungphûm chunga chun tûkhawmin rângkachakin amanih, tangkain amanih, lungmantamin amanih, thingin amanih, sâwlhnain amanih, bupâwlin amanih bâwl sienla, mi tin sinthaw chu inlang a tih;"
"each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.","ni chun a suklang ding a ni sih a, meiin ân lâr ding a ni leiin, mei ngei chun mi tin sinthaw chu ieng ang am a ni fie tâng a tih."
"If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.","Tû sinthaw khawm a chunga a bâwl chu a um zing chun, ama chun lâwmman hmûng a tih."
"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.","Tû sinthaw khawm a kâng chun, ama chun chân a tih, ama tak ruok chu sandamin um a tih, nisienlakhawm, meia fe thleng ang elin."
"Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",Pathien in in ni le Pathien Thlarau nangniah a um ti in hriet naw am a nih?
"If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.","Tûkhawmin Pathien in chu a sukkhawhlo chun Pathienin ama chu sukkhawhlo vêng a tih, Pathien in chu ân thieng sih a, chu in chu nangni in nih."
"Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.",Tûkhawmin ama le ama inhlêm naw raw se. Nangni laia tûkhawm hi khawvêla vara inngai chu a hung var theina dingin mi invêtah hung inchang phawt raw se.
"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:","Hi khawvêl varna hi Pathien ngaiah invêtna a ni sih a. “Ama chun mi varhai chu anni var vervêknaah a âwk hlak,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
"and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.","“Lalpa chun mi varhai ngai- tuona chu a thlâwn a nih ti a hriet,” ti ziek a ni nâwk bawk a."
Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;,"Chuleiin, tûkhawmin mihriem- hai suong naw raw se."
"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;","Iengkim hi in ta vawng a ni sih a: Paula amanih, Appolo amanih, Ki- pha amanih, khawvêl amanih, hring- na amanih, thina amanih, thil um tasahai amanih, a hung um dinghai le chun a rêngin in ta vawng a nih."
and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.,"Nangni khawm Krista ta in na, Krista khawm chu Pathien ta a nih."
"Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.",Keinirawi hi Krista rawngbâwltu le Pathien thurûk enkawltuah miin mi ngai raw hai se.
"Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.",Hitaka hin enkawltu chu mi ringum ni a ngai bawk a nih.
"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.","Nisienlakhawm, nangniin in mi fiena le, mihriem ngaituonain in mi fiena chu ka ta dingin thil chîterek ang a nih, kei le kei khawm kân fie ngai bawk nawh."
For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.,"Iengkhawm indemna ding kân hriet si nawh a, nisienlakhawm, chu chun thiem a mîn changtir chuong nawh, a mi fietu chu Lalpa a ni lem."
"Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.","Chuongchun, a hun hma hin iengkhawm fie naw ro, Lalpa hung hmakhat chu, ama chun inthima thil thuphmanghai chu varah hung la suok a tih, lungrila tumhai khawm chu suklang bawk a tih; chu pha chun mi tinin Pathien kuoma chun an chantâwka inpâkna hlaw seng tâng an tih."
"Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.","Chun, unauhai, thu ziekhai chu in hmu khûm nawna dingin, keinia hin in inchûk theina dingin, chuong thuhai chu in ṭhatna dingin kei le Appolo kân bel a nih, nangni laia tûkhawmin pakhat suonga pakhat in uongkhum nawna dingin."
"For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?",Nang tûin am a sukdanglam chuong cheh a? Dawng naw chu ieng am i nei leh? I dawng a ni si chun iengdinga i dawng ni lo anga i uongpui am a na?
"Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.","Tuta inthawkin in tlai tah a, tuta inthawkin in hausa tah a, kan ṭhang loin ro in rêl a ni ta hi! Anih, ro rêl tak tak unla kan nuom a nih, keini khawma nangni le ro kan rêl theina dingin."
"For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.",Pathienin keini tirkohai hi thi dinga ruot tasa angin a nu- hnungtakah a mi târsuok angah ka ngai a nih; khawvêl le vântirkohai le mihriemhai mithmuah ennuoma siemin kan um hi.
"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.","Keini chu Krista leiin mi invêt kan nih, nangni ruok chu Kristaa chun mi var in ni lem a nih! Keini chu kan hrât nawh a, nangni ruok chu in hrât a nih! Nangni chu mi inpâkin in um a, keini ruok chu mi hmusitin kan um a nih."
"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;","Tu chen khawm hin, kan phîng a ṭâmin kan dang a châr a, silfên kan khawp nawh a, mi kut inthak nûlna kan na, umna bulbâl kan nei nawh a,"
"and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;","mâni kuta sin thawin kan inrim hle hlak a, miin an mi halin mal kan sâwmpêk a, miin an mi suknawmna leh kan tuor fan fan a;"
"being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.","miin an mi hrilsiet leh zaidam- takin kan hril hlak, tu chen khawm hin khawvêl hnâwlhnawk, thil po po hmunhnawk angin an mi siem a nih."
"I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.","Sukzak ding cheuin hieng thu hi ka ziek nawh a, ka nau dittakhai anga infuina ding cheuin ka ziek lem a nih."
"For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.",Kristaa chun inchûktirtu sîng khat nei unla khawm pa chu tamtak in nei si naw a nih; keiin Krista Isua chun Chanchin Ṭhain ka nei cheu a ni kha.
"I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.","Chuongchun, mîn chûk dingin ka ngên cheu a nih."
"For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.","Chuleichun, Timothe, Lalpaa ka nau dittak le ringum chu in kuomah ka hung tir a nih, ama chun Kristaa ka umdân ram tina kohran tina ka închûktir hlak ang hi inhriettir nâwk a ti cheu."
"Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.","Chun, kei in kuoma hung nâwk ta naw ding ang elin ṭhenkhat in uong a nih."
"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpain rem a ti chun, sâwtnawtê hnungah in kuomah hung ka tih; chuongchun, mi uonghai thu chu ni loin, an thil- thawtheina chu hre lem tâng ka tih."

"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?","A ieng am in nuom lem? Hmawltum leh am a ni in kuomah ka hung ding, hmangaina le thuhnuoi- rawl lungril putin?"
"It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his father’s wife.","Nangni lai indit a um ti ân thang veng vung a nih, chuong ang indit chu Jentailhai lai hmana um ngai lo, nangni laia mi pakhatin mâni pa nuhmei a nei kha."

"For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,","Keima ngei hi taksain ka ṭhang naw nâk a, thlaraua ruok chu ka ṭhang a, chuong ang thil chuong ang lâwm lâwm thawtu chu tu khawm hin Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin nangni laia ṭhang zing angin ka lo ngaituo zo tah:"

Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?,"In uong san hi a ṭha nawh ie, chawl tlâwmtêin bei tlang chu a zawpsuo vawng hlak ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
"Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ:","Chawlṭhanglo in ni ang bawkin bei tlang thar in ni theina dingin chawl hlui chu zenfai ro. Ei Fekân Ruoiṭhena ding khawm an that ta sih a, Krista ngei chu;"
"wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.","chuleiin, ruoi ṭhêng ei tiu, chawl hluia ṭhe loin, nunsiet le suolna chawla ṭhe bawk loin, takna le indikna chawlṭhanglo beiin ruoi ṭhe lem ei tiu."
I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;,Ka lekhathawna khan indit hmanghai pâwl lo dingin in kuomah ka ziek kha;
"not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:","hi khawvêla indit hmanghai amanih, duâm le hlêpruhai amanih, milim betuhai amani chu pâwl dêr lo ding ti ka ni nawh a, chuongchu ni sien la khawvêla inthawka fe suok ngei ding in ni ding a ni sih a."
"but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.","Tu ruok hin chu tûkhawm unau hming input siin indit hmang mi amanih, mi duâm amanih, milim betu amanih, inhalhmang amanih, zu inruihmang mi amanih, hlêpru mi amani ni sienla, pâwl lo dingin in kuomah ka ziek a nih; chuong ang mi kuoma chun a fâk khawm fa lo dingin."

All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.,"Thil iengkim thaw ka ta dingin a thieng a; nisienlakhawm, thil iengkim thaw a ṭha kher nawh; thil iengkim thaw ka ta dingin a thieng a; nisienlakhawm, ieng thu hnuoia um khawm kân phal nawh."
"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:","Fâk dinghai chu phîng ta ding a na, phîng chu fâk dinghai ta ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin sukbo ve vêng a tih.

"and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.","Pathienin Lalpa chu a keitho a, eini khawm a thilthawtheinain mi keitho vêng a tih."
"Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.",In taksahai chu Krista pênghai a nih ti in hriet naw am a nih? Krista pênghai chu lâkpêkin nawchizawr pênghaiah ka siem ding am a nih? Teu lo e!

Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.,Indit hi tlânsan ro. Mihriem isuksuol tinrêng hi taksa puotiengah a nih; mi dithmang ruok chun ama taksa chungah a suksuol a nih.
"Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;","Anleh, in taksa chu in sûnga um Pathien kuoma inthawka in hmu Thlarau Inthieng in a ni ti in hriet naw am a nih? Mâni ta khawm in ni nawh a,"
for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.,"mana inchâwk in ni tah in sawnnaw; chuleiin, in taksaa chun Pathien chawimawi ro."
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.,"Chun, in thil ziek thuhai kha: Pasal ta dingin nuhmei tâwklo a ṭha a nih. “Pasalin nuhmei a nei naw chun a thaw ṭha a nih,” in tih a."
"But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.","Nisienlakhawm, inditnahai a um hlak leiin pasalin nuhmei bîk nei seng hai sienla, nuhmei khawmin pasal bîk nei seng raw hai se."
Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.,Pasal chun a nuhmei kuomah a chan ding tâwk chu pe raw se; chuong ang bawkin nuhmei khawma pasal kuomah a chan ding tâwk chu pe bawk raw se.
"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.","Nuhmei chun ama taksa chungah thu a nei nawh a, a pasal chun thu a nei lem a nih; chuong ang bawkin pasal khawm chun mâni taksa chungah thu a nei nawh a, a nuhmei chun thu a nei lem a nih."
"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.","Ṭawngṭai dinga in inpêk theina ding le in inpâwl nâwk theina dingin sâwt nawtê kâr dinga rem in ti ve ve chau naw chun atu tu khawm insukdâwng naw ro, chuong naw chun, in insûm zo naw leiin Setanin thlêm a ti cheu."
"But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.","Nisienlakhawm, hi thu hi thupêk ang tienga ka hril a ni nawh a, phal tieng thua ka hril lem a nih."
"Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.","Nisienlakhawm, mi po po keia angtak hin um vawng hai sien ka nuom a nih. Amiruokchu, mi tinin Pathien kuoma inthawkin thilpêk mâni hmu zâwng an nei seng a nih; pakhatin kawng dangin, a dangin kawng dangin."
"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.","Nisienlakhawm, lêngṭulhai le hmeithaihai kuoma chun hi ka ti a nih; keia angtak hin um hai sien an ta dingin ṭhâng a tih."
"But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.","Insûm theina an nei naw chun innei el raw hai se, hur nêkin innei a ṭha lem sih a."
"But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband","Chun, innei sahai kuoma chun thu ka pêk (Keia pêk ruok chu ni loin Lalpa pêk a ni lem): Nuhmei chun a pasal ṭhe naw raw se;"
"(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.","nisienlakhawm, a ṭhe nghâl nghâl chun pasal nei ta loin um law law raw se, annawleh, a pasal le bawk inrem nâwk raw se; chun, pasal chun a nuhmei ma naw raw se."
"But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.","Mi dang kuoma ruok chun Lalpa ni loin keiin ka hril: Unau tûkhawmin nuhmei awilo mi nei sienla, ama chun a kuoma um zing a lungni phawt chun ma naw raw se."
"And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.","Chun, nuhmei pasal awilo mi nei chun, a pasalin a kuoma um zing a lungni phawt chun, ṭhe naw raw se."
"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.","Pasal awilo mi chu a nuhmei zârah sukthiengin a um a, nuhmei awilo mi khawm chu a pasal zâra sukthiengin a um bawk a nih; chuong ang chu ni naw sien chu in nauhai chu inthieng naw nihai; nisienla- khawm, an inthieng zing a nih."
"Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us in peace.","Nisienlakhawm, a awinaw lemin a ṭhe chun ṭhe el raw se, chuong anga chun chu unaupa amanih, farnu amanih hrên an ni ta nawh. Pathien ruok chun inremnaah a mi ko a nih."
"For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?","Aw nuhmei, i pasal i sandam ding le ding naw iengtin am i hriet leh? Aw pasal, i nuhmei i sandam ding le ding naw iengtin am i hriet leh?"
"Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, Lalpa chun mi tin kuoma a sem pângngai ang seng le, Pathienin mi tin a kona pângngai ang sengah um raw se. Chuong ang chun kohranhai po poah ka ruot hlak."
Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.,Sertan ta hnung ko an um am? Sertan naw mi ni naw raw se. Sertan loa um ko an um am? Ser intantir naw raw se.
"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.","Pathien thupêkhai pawm chau naw chu sertan hi iengkhawm a ni nawh a, sertan naw khawm iengkhawm a ni chuong nawh."
Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.,Mi tin koa an um laia an chan pângngaia chun um zing seng raw se.
"Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use it rather.",Suoka i um ko am i nih? chu chu ngaituo nuom naw rawh; i suok thei si ruok chun hmang lem rawh.
"For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.","Suoka um Lalpaa ko chu Lalpa insuoktir suok a ni sih a, chuong ang bawk chun suok ni loa koa um chu Krista suok a nih."
Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.,Mana inchâwk in ni tah; mihriemhai suokah lût naw ro.
"Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.","Unauhai, mi tin koa in um laia in chan pângngaia chun Pathien kuomah um zing seng ro."
"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.","Chun, nunghâk inthieng tieng thua ruok chun Lalpa thupêk hrim ka nei nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ringuma um dinga Lalpa kuoma inthawka lunginsietna hmu ka ni leiin ka ngaituo ang hril ka tih."
"I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is.","Chuongchun, tulai rinumna lei hin hi hi ṭhain ka ring, mi a um ngaia a um zing hi."
Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.,Nuhmeia khuopde i ni am a nih? Sûtna zawng naw rawh. Nuhmeia khuopde naw i ni am? Nuhmei zawng naw rawh.
"But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.","Nisienlakhawm, nuhmei i nei chun thil i suksuol nawh, nunghâk inthieng khawma pasal a nei chun thil a suksuol chuong nawh. Amiruokchu, chuong ang mi chun tisaa chun rinum tuor a tih, nisienla- khawm, kei ruok chun intuortir naw cheu ka nuom a nih."
"But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;","Amiruokchu, unauhai, hi hi ka ti a nih; hun hi suktâwiin a um a nih, tuta hnung chu, nuhmei neihai chu neinaw anga an um theina ding le,"
"and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;","ṭaphai chu ṭapnawhai anga an um theina ding le, lâwmhai chu lâwmnaw anga an um theina ding le; inchawtuhai chu neinaw anga an um theina ding le,"

"But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:","Nisienlakhawm, lungkham nei loa in um ka nuom pêk cheu a nih, nuhmei neinaw chun Lalpa suklâwm theina ding zie ngaituoin Lalpa tieng thil chu a lungkham hlak."
"but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,",Nuhmei nei ruok chun a nuhmei suklâwm theina dingzie ngaituoin khawvêl tieng thil chu a lungkham lem hlak.
"and is divided. So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.","Chun, pasal nei le nunghâk inthieng chu an inang bawk nawh a; pasal neinaw chun a taksa le a thla- raua inthiengtaka a um theina dingin Lalpa tieng thil chu a lungkham hlak a, pasal nei ruok chun a pasal suk- lâwm theina dingzie ngaituoin khawvêl tieng thil a lungkham lem hlak."
"And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.","Chuong chu nangni ṭhatna dinga ka hril a nih; hruia ka khit theina ding cheua ka hril a ni nawh a, umdân mawi tâwka in um theina ding le, Lalpa rawng chu buoi loa in bâwl theina dingin ka hril lem a nih."
"But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.","Amiruokchu, tûkhawmin a nau nunghâk inthieng ân lêng sâwttir kawnga a sukdik naw a ân hriet chun, ama chu a vânglai a na, a ṭul bawk si chun a thaw nuom chu thaw raw se, thil a suksuol nawh, inneitir el raw se."
"But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, shall do well.","Nisienlakhawm, lungril dettak puta, ṭul ti loa, ama nuom zâwng ruok chu hlen theia, a nau nunghâk inthieng chu kawl zing a lungrila tum tlattu chun thaw ṭha lem a tih."
So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.,"Chuongchun, pasal inneitirtu chun a thaw ṭha, nisienlakhawm ân neitir nawtu chun a thawṭha nâwk zuol a nih."
"A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.","Nuhmei chu a pasal dam sûng po po chu phuor a na; nisienlakhawm, a pasal a thi ta chun a nuom nuom nei thei a tih; amiruokchu, Lalpaa um mi a ni ding a nih."
"But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.","Nisienlakhawm, keia ngai chun, a um ngaia a um zing chun hamṭha lem a tih; kei khawm Pathien Thlarau chu nei ve bawkin kân ring a nih."
"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.","Chun, milimhai kuoma inthâwina thilhai thu kha chu: Ei rêngin hrietna ei nei seng ti ei inhriet a. Hrietna hin chu mi a sukuong hlak a, lunginsietna ruok chun mi a siem ṭha hlak."
"If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;","Tûkhawmin thil ieng amani hrea ân ngai chun, a hriet ding ang chu a la hriet nawh a;"
"but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.","amiruokchu, mi tûkhawmin Pathien a hmangai chun, chu ngei chu ama ihriet a nih."
"Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.","Chuongchun, milimhai kuoma inthawina thil fâk kawnga chu, khawvêla hin milim hrim hrim chu iengkhawm an ni nawzie le, pakhat chau naw chu Pathien dang hrim an um naw chu ei hriet a."
"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;","Vâna manih, hnuoia manih pathien hmingput um hai sien- khawm, (chuong ang pathien tamtak le lalpa tamtak an um sih a,)"
"yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.","Eini ta ding chun Pathien pakhat chau (Pa chu) a um a, ama kuoma inthawkin tinrêng a suok a, eini khawm ama ta dinga um ei nih; Lalpa pakhat chau (Isu Krista chu) a um bawk a, ama leiin iengkim a um a, eini khawm ama lei bawka um ei nih."
"Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.","Amiruokchu, chu hrietna chu mi po po kuomah a um nawh, chuongchun, mi ṭhenkhatin tu chen hin milim be ṭhang an ni leiin, milim kuoma inthâwina thil angtaka ngaiin an fâk hlak; chuongchun, an sie le ṭha hrietna chu a hrât naw leiin a hung inthiengnaw hlak."
"But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.","Nisienlakhawm, fâk ding hin Pathien mit mîn tlungtir chuong naw ni; fa naw inla khawm se chuong naw bawk ei tih; fa inla khawm ṭha chuong naw bawk ei tih."
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.,"Nisienlakhawm, fîmkhur ro, chuong naw chun, nuom nuoma in tlat theina hi mi hrâtnawhai ta dingin tlûkna ni rawi a tih."
"For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?","Nang hrietna nei mi, tûkhawm- in milim biekna ina thlaithlêng awta an hmu si che chun, anni chu mi hrâtnaw lo ni hai sienla an sie le ṭha hrietna chun milim kuoma inthâwina thil fâk a hung ngam ding a ni naw am a nih?"
"For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.","Chuongchun, i hrietna lei chun mi hrâtnaw (unau a thi ai Kristain a thipêk) chu suksietin um a tih."
"And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.","Unauhai chungah chuong ang thil in suksuola, an sie le ṭha hrietna a hrât naw nâklai, in inhliem hlau chun, Krista chungah thil in suksuol a nih."
"Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.","Chuleiin, fâk dingin ka unau a sukthlûk chun, ka unau ka sukthlûk nawna dingin kumkhuoin sa hrim hrim fa ta naw ning."
