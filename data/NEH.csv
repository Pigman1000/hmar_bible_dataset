"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,","Hakalia naupa Nehemia thuhai chu: Hieng ang hi a hung na, kum sâwmhnina, Kisleu thlaa, Susa khawpuia ka um laiin,"
"that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.","ka unaupa pakhat Hanani le Juda rama inthawka mi ṭhenkhat an hung a; chun, Judahai sala intâng suok tahai chanchin le Jerusalem chanchin kân dawn a."
"And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.","Ka kuoma chun, “Sala intâng suok tah, chu rama dama la umhai chu chan setak le hrilsietin an um a; chun, Jerusalem kul chu a chim rem rum tah a, a kawtkhârhai khawm a kâng a,” an tih a."
"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,","Chuong thu chu ka hriet chun ka ṭhung chawt a, ka ṭap a; ni ieng zât amani chu lungngaiin ka um a; chun, bu ka nghei a, vân Pathien hmaa chun ka ṭawngṭai a;"
"and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:","“Aw LALPA, vân Pathien, Pathien ropui le ṭium, nangma hma- ngaia i thupêk pawmtuhai chunga thuthlung hlena lunginsietna suk- langtu,"
"let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father’s house have sinned:","Israel thlahai suolna, i chunga kan suolna thupha ka chawi sûng hin i na lo sit la; i mit lo meng la, i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina, i kuoma a sûn a zâna i siehlaw Israel thlahai ka ngênpêkna hi lo ngaithlapêk la; kei le ka pa sûnghai chu kan lo suol ta sih a."
"we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.","I chungah ṭha lotakin thil kan lo thaw tah a, i siehlaw Mosie kuoma i pêk, thupêkhai, dânhai, rorêlhai chu kan lo zâwm ta si nawh a."
"Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:","I siehlaw Mosie kuoma, ‘In baw- siet chun hnam tin laia chun sukdar ka ti cheu a;"
"but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.","amiruokchu, keia tieng in hung ngha nâwk a, ka thupêkhai in pawm a, in zâwm chun, nangni laia mi kâwlkawdawng chena hnawt suoka um khawm um hai sienla, chutaka inthawk khawm chun kei khâwm nâwk ka ti cheu a, ka hming ka înumtirna ding hmuna ka ruota chun ṭhuoi nâwk ka tih,’ tiha thu i pêk kha lunginsiettakin hre zing rawh."
"Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.","Chun, hienghai hi i siehlawhai le i mihai, i thilthawtheina nasatak le i kut thahrâta în tlan suokhai an na."
"O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.","Aw LALPA, lunginsiettakin i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina le i hming ṭi lâwm zâwnga nei, i siehlawhai ṭawngṭainaa hin i na lo sit ta; chun, vawisûn hin i siehlaw hi mîn hlawtlingtir la, hi mi mithmua hin lunginsiettakin zângaina indawngtir rawh,” ka tih a.

"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.","Chun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu an insukthieng a, chun, mipui- hai, kulhai, a kawtkhârhai an suk- thieng a."
"Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:","Chuongchun, Judahai mi lien- hai chu kul chunga chun ka hang ṭhuoi a; lâwmthu hril inzui nghuon nghuon ding pâwl lientak pâwl hni ka ruot a; pâwl khat chu hmunhnawk kawtkhâr tieng, kul chung chang- tieng pangah an feh a;"
"and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,","chun, anni chu Hosaia le Juda mi lien zâtve hai;"
"and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,","Azaria, Ezra Mesullam,"
"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,","Juda, Benjamin, Semaia, Jeremia,"
"and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;","tawtawrâwt chawi thiempu nau ṭhenkhathai le, Asaph naupa Zakkur, chu naupa Mikaia, chu naupa Mattania, chu naupa Semaia, chu naupa Jonathan, chu naupa Zekaria hai;"
"and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.","a unau Semaia, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Juda, Pa- thien mi David sut hlak thilhai chawi Hanani hai chun an zui a; chun, lekhaziektu Ezra chun an hma a ṭhuoi a."
"And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.","Chun, tuikhur kawtkhâr an tlungin kul hang kai ṭannaa an hmazâwn David khaw kailâwna hang fein David in saka chun an feh a, saktieng panga Tui kawtkhâr tlung rakin."
"And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,","Chun, lâwmthu hriltu pâwl danghai chu anni le intuok dingin vawi tieng pangah an feh a, chun, keiin mipui zâtve hai leh Meipui sepna Insâng sakah, kul chungah kullien chenin ka zui a,"
"and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.","Ephraim kawtkhâr chunga dâm, Kawtkhâr hluia dâm, nga kawt- khâra dâm, Hananel insânga dâm, Za insânga dâm, Beram kawtkhâr tlung rakin; chun, Vengtu kawtkhâra chun an ngîr a."
"So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;","Chuongchun, lâwm thu hril- tu pâwl hnihai chu Pathien inah an ngîr a, kei le rorêltu zâtve hai leh;"
"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;","chun, tawtawrâwt chawi thiem- puhai Eliakim, Maaseia, Miniamin, Mikaia, Elioenai, Zekaria le Hana- nia,"
"and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.","chun, Maaseia, Semaia, Elea- zar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkija, Elam le Ezer leh. Chun, hlasaktuhai chun an hotu Jezrahia rawiin inringtakin an sak a."
"And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.","Chu ni chun inthâwina nasatak an inhlân a, an hlim hle el a; Pa- thienin hlim namên loin a sukhlim a nih; chun, nuhmeihai le naupanghai chen khawmin an hlim hleh a; chuongchun, Jerusalem hlimna chu hlataka inthawk khawmin ân hriet a."
"And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.","Chun, chu ni chun thaw- lâwmhai, a thêna thêna thilinhlân dâm, thlai thar hmasa tak dâm, sâwma pakhat dâm, siekhâwmna pindanhaia hotu, dânin a ruot ang thiempu le Levi mihai chanvo khaw tin lohma izir ang pei la khâwmtu dinghai an ruot a; Judahai chu rawngbâwltu thiempu le Levi mihai lei chun an lâwm hleh a."
"And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.","An Pathien rawngbâwl dân ding le, insukthiengna dân chu an zâwm a, hlasaktuhai le kawtkhâr vengtuhai khawmin, David le a naupa Solomon thupêk ang chun."
"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.","Tienlaia David le Asaph dam lai chun hlasak pâwl hotu an um hlak a, Pathien inpâkna hla le lâwmna hla an sak hlak a nih."
"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.","Zerubbabel dam lai le, Nehemia dam lai chun Israel po poin hlasak- tuhai le kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu ni tina an tlâk tâwk ding chanvo an siempêk hlak a; chun, Levi mihai chu chanvo a suktumpêk bawk a; chun, anni Levi mihai chun Aron naupasal- hai chanvo chu an suktumpêk hlak a."
"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,",Chu ni chun mipui na hrieta chun Mosie lekhabu an tiem a; chutaka chun Ammon mihai le Moab mihai chu Pathien mihai in- khâwmnaa chun ieng lai khawmin an ṭhang ve dêr ding a ni nawh ti hi a chuong a;
"because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.","Israel thlahai bei le tuia tuok lo a, anni ṭawngsie inphur dinga Balaam an ruoi lei khan; nisienlakhawm, ei Pathien chun ṭawngsie chu mal- sâwmnaah ân changtir ta lem a."
"And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.","Chun, Dân chu an hang ngai zo chun Israel mihai laia inthawk chun anni chawkpawltu mipuihai chu an suktum tah a."
"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,","Chu hma chun kan Pathien in pindanhaia hotu dinga ruot thiempu Eliasib, Tobia tieng mi chun"
"had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.","kha hmaa Levi mihai, hlasak- tuhai, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chanvo, beiphit thilinhlân dâm, riminhnik dâm, bûr le bêlhai, bu sâwma pakhat dâm, uoin le hriek le thiempuhai ta ding a thêna thên thilinhlânhai an siena hlak pindan lientak Tobia ta ding chun a buotsaipêk a."
"But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thil po pohai um lai chun Jerusalem khuoah ka um nawh a; Babulon lal Artazerzia kum sâwmthum pahni ân lal kumin lal kuoma chun ka fe a nih, ni ieng zât amani hnunga chun phalna ka hni nâwk a;"
"and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.","chun, Jerusalem khuoah ka va feh a, Pathien in inhuonna tuolsûng laia chun pindan buotsaipêka Tobia ta dinga Eliasab thil ṭha naw lo thaw chu ka hriet tah a."
And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.,"A mi suklungninaw êm êm el a; chuleiin, Tobia in sûng thuomhnaw po po, chu pindana inthawk chun ka the suok vawng a."
"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.","Chun, thu ka pêk a, pindanhai chu an inthiel fai a; chuongchun, Pathien in bûr le bêlhai chu beiphit thilinhlânhai le riminhnikhai le chun ka lâklût nâwk a."
"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.","Chun, Levi mihai chu chanvo pêk an ni naw leiin, Levi mihai le hlasaktuhai chu mâni lo tieng sengah an tlândar ta ti ka hriet nâwk ta bawk a."
"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.","Chuongchun, rorêltuhai chu ka khak a, “Ieng dinga Pathien in hi thlathlam a ni zing el am a ni leh?” ka tih a. Anni chu ka ko khâwm vawng a, an hmun sengah kân umtir nâwk a."
Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.,"Chuongchun, Juda mihai po po chun, bu sâwma pakhat dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm thawlâwm sie khâwmnaa chun an hung lâk khâwm tâwl a."
"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.","Chun, thiempu Selemia le lekhaziektu Zadok le Levi mihai laia mi Pedaia hai chu thawlâwm sie khâwmnahai hotu dingin ka siem a, anni ṭhangpuitu ding chun Mattania nau Zakkur naupa Hanan a um a; ringuma ngai an na; an sinthaw chu an unauhai laia thil sem vêl a nih."
"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.","Aw ka Pathien, hi thua hin mi hre zing la, ka Pathien in le a rawng- bâwlna dinga ka thil thaw ṭhathai chu thaihmang lul naw rawh."
"In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.","Chuong lai chun Juda rama chun châwlnia uoin sâwrna khura sir sâwr dâm, buphal hung phur dâm, uoin dâm, grêp dâm, theichang dâm, phurrik tinrêng inphurtir dinga siem sabengtung siem lai mêk dâm ka hmuh a; chuong chu châwlniah Jerusalemah an hung phur lût a; fâk ding zawr nihaia chun ân dik nawzie kân hriettir a."
"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.","Tura rama mi chutaka chêng vehai khawmin ngahai le thuom- hnaw tinrênghai an hung lâk a, châwlniin Juda mihai kuoma le Jerusalemah an zawr a."
"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?","Chuongchun, Juda mi lienhai chu ka khak a, an kuomah, “Châwlni sukpawrchea in thil ṭha naw thaw hi ieng am a nih a?"
"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.","In pi le puhai khawm khan hieng ang hi an thaw a ni naw am a nih? Chun, ei Pathien chun hieng thil ṭha nawhai po po hi ei chunga le hi khaw chunga hin a hung intlungtir tah a ni naw am a nih? Chuong sa sa khawmin châwlni sukpawrchein Israel mihai chungah lunginsenna in lân tlungsatir rawp el hi,” ka tih a."
"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.","Chun, châwlni dinga Jerusalem kul kawtkhâr ân thim deu hlek phingleh kawtkhârhai chu khâr ding- in thu ka pêk a; chun, châwlni a bo hmakhat chun hawng lo dingin thu ka pêk bawk a; châwlnia thil phur hrim hrim an lâklût nawna dingin ka mihai ṭhenkhat chu kawtkhâr kân vêngtir a."
So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.,"Chuongchun, sumdâwng mihai le thuomhnaw tinrêng zawr mihai chu vawi khat amanih, vawi hni amani chu Jerusalem puotienga chun an riek a."
"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.","Chuongchun, ân dik nawzie chu kân hriettir a, an kuomah, “Ieng- dinga kul bula riek am in na? Hieng anga in thaw nâwk chun in chungah ka kut thlâk ka tih,” ka tih a. Chu chena inthawk chu châwlni chun an hung nâwk ta nawh a."
"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.","Chun, Levi mihai chu inthien faia, châwlni sukthiengna dinga kul kawtkhâr hung vêng dingin thu ka pêk a. Aw ka Pathien, hi thua khawm hin mi hre zing la, i lunginsietna nasatzie ang peiin mi hla rawh."
"In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:","Chuong lai chun Juda mi, Asdod nuhmei dâm, Ammon nuhmei dâm, Moab nuhmei dâm nuhmeia neihai chu ka hmuh a;"
"and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.","an nauhai chu Asdod ṭawngin an ṭawng lem hman hman a, chuong- hai ṭawng dân ang chau naw chun Juda ṭawngin an ṭawng thei nawh."
"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.","Chun, anni chu ka khak tâwl a, ṭawngsie kân phur a, ṭhenkhat lem chu ka vuok a, an sam dâm ka kei phawipêk a, an naunuhmeihai chu chuong naupasalhai chu inneitir lo ding le, chuonghai naunuhmeihai chu an naupasalhai ta dingin amanih, anni ta ding khawma nei lo dingin Pathien sâlin ṭawng kân khâmtir a."
"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.","“Israel lal Solomon khawm kha hieng thilhaia hin a suol a ni naw am a nih? Chuong sa khawm chun hnam tamtak laia ama ang lal an um nawh a, a Pathien mi dit zâwng tak a na, Israel ram po po chungah Pathienin lalah a siem bawk a; nisienlakhawm, ama meu khawm chu ram dang nu- hmeiin an suksuol el ta a nih."
"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?","Chuongchun, ram dang nu- hmeihai neia ei Pathien chunga hin thil ṭha nawtak el hi thaw dingin in thu ei zâwm ding am a nih?” ka tih a."
"And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.","Chun, thiempu lal Eliasib nau, Joiada naupa pakhat Horon mi Sanballat mâkpa a na, chuleiin, ka kuoma inthawk chun kân tlân- hmangtir tah a."
"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.","Aw ka Pathien, thiempu nina sin le, thiemputna sin thuthlung le, Levi mihai thuthlung an sukpawrche leiin hre zing tâwl raw khai."
"Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;","Chuong ang chun ram dang mihaia inthawkin ka sukthieng a, thiempu dâm, Levi mihai ta dinga an sinthawna sengah an rawngbâwl dân ding ka ruotpêk a;"
"and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.","a hun ruot senga thing inhlân ding le thlai thar hmasa tak ta ding dâmin. Aw ka Pathien, a ṭha tiengin mi hre zing rawh khai."
"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.","Chun, lal Artazerzia kum sâwm- hni ân lal kum, Nisan thlaah uoin an hung pêk hnung chun, uoin chu ka lâk a, lal chu ka pêk a. Kha hma khan chu a hmaa hin lungngai hmêl ka la put ngai nawh a;"
"And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.","lal chun ka kuomah, “I damnaw khawm chu a ni si nawh a, iengtiziea lungngai hmêl i put am a na? thil dang ni naw nih, i lungril a lungngai a ni hi maw,” a mi tih a. Chuongchun, ka ṭi ta êm êm el a."
"And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?","Kei chun lal kuoma chun, “Lal chu kumkhuoin dam raw se; a mi thlatuhai thlân umna khuo chu a ram tah a, a kawtkhârhai chu a kâng vawng ta sih a, lungngai hmêl put lo thei am nîng ka ti?” ka tih a."
"Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.","Chuongchun, lal chun ka kuom- ah, “Ieng am a na i hni chu?” a tih a. Chuongchun, vân Pathien kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai tah a."
"And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “Lal remti zâwng a nih a, i siehlaw hin i mit ka lo tlung hlak a ni chun, Juda ramah a mi thlatuhai thlân umnaa chun mîn fetir la; khuo chu va siemthar nâwk ka tih,” ka tih a."
"And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.","Lal chun ka kuomah, (lalnu khawm chu a kâwla chun a ṭhung ve a), “Ieng chen am va thang i ta, ieng tik am hung nâwk i ta?” a tih a. Chuongchun, lal chun lâwmtakin a mîn fetir tah a, kei khawm chun hunbi ka tiem bawk a."
"Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;","Chu bak khawm chu ni loin lal kuoma chun, “Lal remti zâwng a ni chun, vadung râla rorêltuhai inhmu- tir dingin, Juda ram ka tlung chen an mîn fetir theina dingin phalna lekha mi pe la;"
"and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.","chun, lal ramhâk vêngtu Asaph inhmutir dingin invêngna kulbîng kawtkhâr kal ding le, khawpui kul ding dâmin, ka va hluo ding ina hmang ding dâmin thing a mi pêk theina dingin lekha mi pe bawk rawh,” ka tih a. Chun, ka Pathien mi ditsakna ang peiin lal chun a mi pêk tah a."
"Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.","Chuongchun, vadung râla rorêl- tuhai kuom chu ka va tlung a, lal lekhahai chu ka pêk a. Chun,lal chun ka kuoma chun sipai hotuhai le sipai sakawr chung chuong mihai ân fetir ve a nih."
"And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.","Chun, Horon mi Sanballat le Ammon mi siehlaw, Tobia haiin an lo hriet chun, Israel thlahai thawveng- na ding ngaituo dingin mi an hung a ni chu tie tiin an lo lungninaw hle el a."
"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.","Chuongchun, Jerusalem chu ka hang tlung a, ni thum ka hei um phawt a."
"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.","Chun, zâna chun ka tho a, kei le mi dang tlâwmtêhai le chun: Jeru- salem ta dinga ka thaw ding, ka Pathienin ka lungrila a sie chu tu- khawm ka hril nawh a; ka chuongna sa ngawt naw chu sa dang ka kuoma um a um nawh a."
"And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.","Zâna chun Ruom kawtkhâra chun ka suok a, Dragon Tuisunsuo tieng le Hmunhnawk kawtkhâr tienga chun ka feh a; Jerusalem kul chimhai le a kawtkhâr kânghai chu ka en vêl a."
Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.,"Chun, Tuisunsuo kawtkhâr le lal Dîl chen chun ka feh a, nisien- lakhawm, ka chuongna sa a fethleng- na ding hrim hrim a um nawh a."
"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.","Chuongchun, zânah vadung chu a tungin ka zui a, kul chu ka en a; chun, ka lêt nâwk a, Ruom kawt- khâra chun ka lût a, chuong ang chun ka hung kîr nâwk tah a."
"And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.","Rorêltuhai chun khâwlai am ka fe a, ieng am a na ka thaw ti khawm chu an hriet nawh a; chun, Judahai, thiempuhai, mi ṭhahai, rorêltuhai le mi dang sin thawtu ding hrim hrim khawm ka la hril hri naw bawk a."
"Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.","Chuongchun, an kuomah, “Ei chan a sietzie hi in hmu a, Jerusalem a ram ti dâm, a kawtkhârhai khawm a kâng ti khawm in hriet a; thaw ro, hrilsiet ei ni ta nawna dingin Jerusalem kul hi inngîr nâwk ei tiu,” ka tih a."
"And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.","Chun, ka Pathienin a mi ditsak thuhai dâm chu ka hril a, ka kuoma lal thuhrilhai le chun. Anni chun, “Tho ei ta, inngîr takluong ei tiu khai,” an tih a. Chuongchun, chu sin ṭha thaw ding chun an kut an sukhrât a."
"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?","Amiruokchu, Horon mi San- ballat le Ammon mi siehlaw Tobia le Arab mi Gesemin an hriet chun, an mi nuisan a, an mi hmusit a, “In thil thaw hi iengtizie am a na? Lal chungah in hel am a nih?” dâm an tih a."
"Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.","Chun, anni chu ka dawn a, an kuomah, “Vân Pathien chun mi suktluongtlung a ta; chuongchun, keini a siehlawhai chu tho kan ta, inngîr kan tih; nangni ruok chun Jerusalema hin chanvo amanih, thuneina amanih, hnûhma amani khawm in nei naw hrim hrim a nih,” ka tih a."
"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.","Chuongchun, thiempu lal Eliasib chu a unau thiempuhai le chun an tho a, Berâm kawtkhâr chu an siem a; an sukthieng a, kawtkhârhai chu an siem a; Hammea in insâng chenin an sukthieng a, Hananel in insâng chen chun."
And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.,A dawta chun Jeriko mihaiin an siem a. Anni dawta chun Imri naupa Zakkur chun a siem a.
"And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.","Chun, Nga kawtkhâr chu Has- sena naupahaiin an siem a; a kalhai an sieh a, a kawtkhâr kalhai an siem a, a kalnahai le a bâtnahai dâm an siem a."
"And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.",Anni dawta chun Hakkoz nau Uria naupa Meremoth chun a siem a. Anni dawta chun Mesezabel nau Berekia naupa Mesullam chun a siem ṭha a.

"And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?","Chuongchun, a unauhai le Samari sipaihai hmaa chun thu a hril a, “Hieng Juda mi hrâtlohai hin ieng am a ni leh an thaw?

"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.","Chun, a kâwla Ammon mi Tobia chun, “Hang inngîrtir hrim raw hai se chu, sihal khawm hang lâwn sien an lung kul chu sukchim el a tih,” a tih a."
"Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;","Aw kan Pathien, en ta, hmusitin kan um hi, an mi hrilsietna chu anni lu chunga ngei inlêttir la, anni khawm khâwlai rama manih muol- photakin intângtir zing rawh;"
"and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.","an bawsietnahai chu inkhum naw la, an suolnahai chu i hmaa inthawka thaihmangin inumtir naw rawh; kul siemtuhai hmaah an suk- lungsen che hi."
So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half the height thereof: for the people had a mind to work.,"Chuongchun, kul chu kan siem a, ân sâng tieng chenvein kul po po chu kan zawm suok vawng a; mipuihai chun thaw inhâwkna lungril chu an put hle a."
"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;","Amiruokchu, Sanballat hai, Tobia hai, Arab mihai, Ammon mihai le Asdod mihaiin kul chu siem ṭhat a ni pei ti an hriet chun an lunginsen ta hle el a;"
"and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.","chuongchun, Jerusalem chu hung thawa buoina siem chu an rawt tâwl tah a."
"But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.","Nisienlakhawm, anni lei chun kan Pathien kuomah kan ṭawngṭai a, sûn le zânah anni chu a vêngtu ding kan sie zing a."
"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.","Chun, Juda chun, “Sinthaw- tuhai tha hlak a châu zo tah a, hmunhnawk hlak a nasa sih a; kul chu ei siem thei ta naw ding a ni hi,” a tih a."
"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.","Kan hmêlmahai hlak chun, “Anni lai ei hang feh a, ei hang that a, sin chu ei hang suktâwppêk hmakhat chun hre naw ni hai a, mi hmu bawk naw ni hai,” an lo ti bawk a."
"And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.","An kuoma Juda umhai an hung hlak khan hmun tum tuma miin vawi sâwm zet, “Kan kuomah in hung nâwk ding a nih,” an mi lo ti zawm- zawt bawk a."
"Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set there the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.","Chuleichun, kul phên, ân hnuoi- na lai tak, hmun inthâwlna fai laia chun mipuihai chu a sûng sûngin an kâwlhnâmhai, an feihai, an thal- ngulhai chawiin ṭhanghmun kân khuortir a."
"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.","Chun, ka hang en vêl a, ka tho a, mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai le mi danghai kuoma chun, “Anni chu ṭi dêr naw unla, LALPA ropuitak le, ṭiumtak el chu hre zingin in unauhai, in nau- pasalhai, in naunuhmeihai, in nu- hmeihai, in inhai hum dingin thaw ro khai,” ka tih a."
"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.","Chun, kan hmêlmahai chun kan lo hriet ti le, an thil thaw tum chu Pathienin teploah a siem ti an hrietin, kul tieng mâni sinthawna sengah kan fe nâwk tâwl tah a."
"And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.","Chutaka inthawk chu ka mihai a zâtve chun sin chu an thaw nâwk tah a; a zâtve danghai chun feihai, phawhai, thalngulhai, âwmphaw- hai chu an kawl a; chun rorêltuhai chu Juda sûnghai hnunga chun an um a,"
"They that builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;","chuong bang siemtuhai hnunga chun. Chun, chuong phurrik phur- tuhai chu an inbel rik ṭeu a, an kut khingkhatin sin an thawh a, khing- tiengin hriemhrei an chawi a;"
"and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.","a siemtuhai chun an kâwlhnâm an pâi seng a, chuong pum chun an siem a nih. Tawtawrâwt mûttu chu keia kâwlah a um a."
"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:","Chun, mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai le mipuihai hmaa chun, “Sin hi a nasain a lien êm a, kula hin ei inhlatin ei indar hle el sih a;"
"in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.","tawtawrâwt ri in hrietna hmun hmuna chun keini kuom tieng hung tlân khâwm unla; ei Pathien chun mi dopêk a tih,” ka tih a."
So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.,"Chuong ang chun sin chu kan thawh a, chun, a zâtve chun vârṭiena inthawka arasi inlang chen feihai chu an kawl zing a."
"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.","Chuong ang bawkin chuong lai chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Zâna mi vênga, sûna sin thaw dingin tu- khawm an siehlawhai leh Jerusalem sûngah riek vawng raw hai se,” ka tih a."
"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one went with his weapon to the water.","Chuongchun, kei khawm, ka unauhai khawm, ka tlangvâlhai khawm, vêngtu a mi zui hlakhai khawm, tukhawma kan silfên kan hlîp hrim hrim nawh a, hriemhrei inbel pum zingin tui tienga chun kan fe hlak a nih."
Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.,"Chun, mipuihai le an nuhmeihai chu an unau Judahai chunga chierin an khêk ta mur mur el a,"
"For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.","“Eini rawi hi ei naupasalhai le ei naunuhmeihai leh tam tâwk tak ei na; bu hi inchûin inchû el ei tiu, ei fâka ei hring theina dingin,” ti dâm an um a."
"Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.","Chun, ṭhenkat, “Ei lohai, ei inhai, ei grêp huonhai hrên dingin ei sie sih a, ṭâm lei hin bu hi ân chûin inchû el ei tiu,” ti dâm khawm an um bawk a."
"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute upon our fields and our vineyards.","“Ei lohai, ei grêp huonhai hrên dinga siein lal kuoma dâm sie chawi dingin sum dâm ei pûk a."
"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.","Ei taksa chu ei unauhai taksa ang bawk a na; ei nauhai khawm an nauhai ang bawk an ni sih a; nisienla- khawm, hi, ei naunuhmeihai, ei naupasalhai hi siehlawa um dingin suokah ei inlûttir takngiel ding a ni hi; ei naunuhmei ṭhenkhat lem chu suokah an lût ta nghe ngheh a, san ngaina hre nghâl lo me; mihaiin ei huonhai le ei grêp huonhai chu an nei ta sih a,” ti dâm an um nuol bawk a."
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.,Chuong thuhai le an rihâu chu ka hrietin ka lunginsen êm êm el a.
"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.","Chuongchun, ka lungrilin ka ngaituo a, mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai chu ka khak a, an kuomah, “Mi tinin in unauhai a pung hnawtin sum in inpûktir zing el a,” ka tih a. Chun, an chungchâng chu ngaituo dingin mi ka ko khâwm ṭeu el a."
"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.","An kuomah, “Hnam dang kuoma zawra um ei unau Judahai chu ei thei ang angin ei intlan a; nangni hin in unauhai hi zawr in tum a ni maw? Nangni kuoma ngei hin zawr an ni ding a ni maw?” ka tih a. Chuong- chun, an to zing a, dawnna ding ieng- khawm an hriet nawh a."
"Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?","“In thil thaw hi a ṭha naw tawp el a nih: ei hmêlma, hnam danghai mi hrilsietna lei hin ei Pathien chu ṭiha in um a ṭûl a ni naw am a nih?"
"And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.",Kei le ka unauhai le ka mihai khawmin kan sum le bu kan inpûktir ve bawk in sawnnaw. A pung hnawta inpûktir hi bân dai ei tiu khai.
"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.","Vawisûn ngei hin an lohai, an grêp huonhai, an oliv huonhai, an inhai le, an sum le an bu le an uoin le hriek hmun zaa hmun khat in lâk hlak khawm chu, pe nâwk vawng ro khai,” ka ti bawk a."
"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.","Chuongchun, anni chun, “Pe nâwk vawng kan tih, annia inthawk- in iengkhawm phût naw ning ungah; i ti ang tak chun thâwng kan tih,” an tih a. Chuongchun, thiempuhai ka ko a, an hmaah chu thutiem ang taka thaw ngei ding chun kân khâmtir a."
"Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.","Ka dierkei chu ka thin a, “Hi thutiem anga thaw naw taphawt chu Pathien chun a ina inthawk le a sin- thawa inthawkin hieng ang hin thinthla raw se; hieng anga thin thlâkin um sienla, sukruokin um raw se,” ka tih a. Chun, a pungkhâwmhai po po chun, “Amen,” an tih a, Lalpa an inpâk a. Chun, mipuihai chun chu thutiem ang chun an thaw tah a."
"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.","Chu naw khawm chu Juda rama anni awptu dinga ruot ka ni china inthawk, lal Artazerzia kum sâwmhni ân lal kuma inthawka kum sâwmthum pahni ân lal kum chen, kum sâwm pahni sûng chun kei le ka unauhai hin ram awptu puol bei hrim hrim khawm kan fâk ngai nawh a."
"But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.","Nisienlakhawm, kha hmaa ram awptu ka hmaa lo umhai chu mihai chungah lu an lo ling hleh a, tangka shekel sâwmli tiem loin an beihai le uoinhai an lâkpêk hlak a; a chu nâksapah an siehlawhai chu mihai chunga chun an insuklal hle hlak a; amiruokchu, kei chun chu Pathien ṭina leiin chuong ang chun ka thaw ve nawh."
"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.","Anih, hi kul sin thaw hin ka um zing a, ram hrim hrim inchâwk khawm kân châwk nawh a: ka mihai po po khawm sin chu thawin chutaka chun an um khâwm zing a nih."
"Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.",Chu chau khawm chu ni loin kan vêla hnam danghai laia inthawk- a hunghai tiem loin Judahai le rorêl- tuhai laia mi ka dawkâna awt hlak mi za le sâwmnga an um zing a nih.
"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.","Chun, ni khat dinga an buotsai chu sebâwngchal pakhat le berâm paruk a ṭha ṭhieu a na; chun, ârhai khawm ka ta dingin an buotsai a, ni sâwm dan peiah uoin hran hran tam tâwk tak leh; chuong ang chun buot- sai hai sienla khawm hieng mihai tuor hi a rik êm leiin ram awptu puol bei chu ka phût naw hrim hrim a nih."
"Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.","Aw ka Pathien, hieng mihai ta dinga ka thilthawhai po po hi ka ṭhatna dingin hre zing rawh aw."
"Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),","Chun, Sanballat le Tobia le Arab mi Gesem le kan hmêlma dang hrim hrimhaiin kulhai ka siem a, a chimna lai hrim hrim a um ta nawh ti an hang hriet chun, (amiruokchu, chuong lai chun kawthaia chun kawt- khârhai chu ka la rem nawh a),"
"that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.","Sanballat le Gesem chun, “Hung la, Ono phaia khuo pakhatah intuok khâwm ei tiu,” tiin thu an mi hung inphur a. Nisienlakhawm, ka chunga thil ṭha naw thaw tum an lo ni zing a."
"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?","Kei chun an kuomah, “Sin ropui- tak ka thawh a, ka hung thla thei nawh, ieng dingin am in kuoma ka hung thlâk kârin sin chu châwl el a ta?” tiin mi ka tir a."
And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.,"Chuong ang ruok chun vawi li thu an hung inphur a, chuong ang ruok chun kei khawma ka dawn a."
"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,","Chuongchun, Sanballat chun chuong ang bawk chun a vawi nganaa chun a siehlaw chu lekha châr loa chawiin ka kuomah a hung tir a;"
"wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.","chutaka chun, “Nang le Judahai hin hel in lungril a, chuleiin, kul chu i siem a nih ti thu hnam danghai lai chun ân thang a, Gesem khawm hin a hril bawk a; chun, an hril pei dâna chun nang hi an lal ding i ni âwm a."
"And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.","Chun, ‘Juda rama chun lal a um,’ tiha i chanchin Jerusalema hril vêl dingin zâwlnei khawm i ruot hiel ta bawk a; hieng thu hi lal kuoma chun hril vak ngei an ta.

"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.","Chuongchun, a kuomah, “I hril ang hrim hrim hin iengkhawm thaw a um nawh, i phuokfâwm el a ni hi,” tiin mi ka tir a."
"For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.","“An sinthaw chu an puitling thei nawna dingin an kuthai chu suk- sietin um a tih,” tiha mi hrilṭi nuom ruok an nih.

"And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.","Chu hnunga chun Mehetabel nau Delaia naupa Semaia, insuk- tumpa ina chun ka feh a; ama chun, “Pathien inah, biekin sûng ngeiah inhmûng ei ti khai; biekin kawtkhâr- hai chu khâr tlat ei ta; nangma that ding chein an hung ding a nih, zânah a nih that ding chea an hung nghe nghe ding chu,” a lo tih a."
"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.","Kei ruok chun, “Keia ang hi hang tlânse el ding khawm am ka nih? Mâni hringna humhim nuom chun tu am biekina chun lût an ta? Lût dêr naw ning,” ka tih a."
"And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.","Chun, ka hang hriet dawk a, Pathien tir a lo ni dêr da el a; keima mi dodâlin chuong thu chu a hril a lo ni lem a, Tobia le Sanballatin an ruoi a lo ni zing a."
"For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.","Ka ṭi a, chuong anga ka thaw a, thil ka suksuol a, a mi sukhming- sietna ding an nei theina dingin a nih an ruoi chu."
"Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.","Aw ka Pathien, Tobia le Sanbal- lat hi an thilthaw ang pei hin hre zing rawh, zâwlneinu Noadia le zâwlnei dang mi sukṭi tumtuhai po po le hin."
"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.","Chuongchun, kul chu ni sâwm- nga le ni hniah, Elul thla ni sâwmhni panga niin zo a ni tah a."
"And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.","Chun, kan hmêlmahai po poin chu chu an lo hriet chun, kan vêla hnam danghai chun an ṭi tah a, chan se ta hlein an inhriet a, sin chu kan Pathien thaw a nih ti an hriet ta sih a."
"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.","Chu naw hrima khawm, chuong lai chun Juda mi ṭhahai chun Tobia chu lekha tamtak an inphur hlak a; chun, Tobia lekha khawm an hmu bawk hlak."
"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.","Ama chu Ara naupa Sekania mâkpa a ni leiin, Juda rama mi tam- tak inkhâm hiela ama inthuruolpui an um a; chun, a naupa Jehohanan chun Berekia naupa Mesullam naunu chu nuhmeiah a nei a nih."
"Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.","Ka hrieta chun a thilthaw ṭhahai chu an hril hlak a, ka thu hrilhai a kuoma chun an intlun bawk hlak. Chuongchun, Tobia chun mîn ṭhi dingin lekha dâm chu a hung thawn hlak a nih."
"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,","Chun, kulhai chu kan siem a, kawtkhârhai chu ka rem tah a, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai, hla saktuhai, Levihai ruot an ni zo chun,"
"that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.","ka unau Hanani le, kulbîng hotu Hanania chu Jerusalem chu kân awptir a; mi ringumtak, mi dang tamtak nêka Pathien ṭi mi a na."
"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.","Chun, an kuomah, “Jerusalem kawtkhârhai hi nisa inkâng hma chun hawng ni naw sienla; vêngtuhai an la ngir laiin kawthai chu khârin kal tlat raw hai se; chun, Jerusalema umhai laia mi vêngtuhai ruot unla, mi tin mâni ngîr hmun hmunah, mi tin mâni in zâwn sengah,” ka tih a."
"Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.","Khuo chu a lienin ân dar hle sih a, a mi umhai chu an tlâwm hleh a, inhai khawm chu la bâwl lo an ni tâwl sih a."
"And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:","Chun, ka Pathien chun ka lung- rilah, mi ṭhahai, rorêltuhai, mipuihai ko khâwm vawnga an thlatuhai dungzuia tiem dingin a mîn hriettir a. Chun, a phut taka hang fehai thla- tuhai hming ziekna bu chu ka hmu suok a; chutaka chun hieng anga ziek hi ka hmuh a:"
"These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;","Sala ṭhuoi Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzarin a ṭhuoihai laia, sala intâng suoka, Jerusalem le Juda rama mâni khuo senga kîr nâwka, chu rama um tahai chu hienghai hi an nih:"

"And some from among the heads of fathers’ houses gave unto the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests’ garments.","Chun, sûngkuo luhai ṭhenkhat- hai chun chu sina ding chun an pêk a.

"And some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.","Chun, sûngkuo lu ṭhenkhathai chun in bâwlna ding thawlâwmah rângkachak darik sing hni le, tang- karuo bûk sâng hni le za hni an thawh a."

"So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.","Chuongchun, thiempuhai, Levi mihai, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai, hlasak- tuhai le mi ṭhenkhathai le Nethinim mihai le Israel mi po po chu mâni khuo sengah an um tah a.

"And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.","Chun, mi po po chu lungril hmunkhatin Tui kawtkhâr zâwn hmun lienna laia chun an fe khâwm a; chun, lekhaziektu Ezra chu LALPAIN Israelhai zâwm dinga thu a pêk Mosie Dân bu chu hung chawi dingin an hril a."
"And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.","Chuongchun, thla sarina, ni khat niin thiempu Ezra chun pung- khâwmhai nutling, patling le a hrethiem thei chin po po hmaa chun Dân chu a hung chawi a."
"And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.","Chutaka mi chu Tui kawtkhâr hmazâwn hmun lienna laia chun nutling, patling le a hrethiem thei chinhai lai zîngtienga inthawkin sûn chenin a tiem a; mi po po chun Dân bu thua chun an na an sit ṭhuop el a."
"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.","Chun, chuong ang dinga an siem hrim thing dawkân insânga chun lekhaziektu Ezra chu a ngîr a, a sir changtienga chun Mattithia, Sema, Anaia, Uria, Hilkia le Maaseia hai an ngîr a; chun, a vawitienga chun Pedaia, Misael, Malkija, Hasum, Hasbaddana, Zekaria le Mesullam an ngîr a."
"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people); and when he opened it, all the people stood up.","Chun, Ezra chun mi po po mithmua chun lekhabu ziel chu a hang sût a, (mi po po nêka insânga ngîr a na), chun, a hang sût chun mi po po chu an ngîr ta vawng a;"
"And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.","chuongchun, Ezra chun LALPA Pathien ropuitak chu ân pâk a; chun, mipui po po chun an bân pharin, “Amen, Amen,” tiin an lo dawn a; chun, an kûn a, an hmaia hnuoi sikin LALPA chu chibai an bûk a."
"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.","Jesua, Bani, Serebia, Jamin, Akkub, Sabbethai, Hodia, Maaseia, Kelita, Azaria, Zojabad, Hanan, Pelaia, Levi mihai chun mipuihai kuomah Dân an hrilfie a: mipuihai chu an ngirhmuna chun an um zing a."
"And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.","Chun, Lekhabu Pathien Dân bua mi chu fietakin an tiem a; a umzie an hrilfieh a, chuongchun, an tiem chu an inhriettir pei a."
"And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.","Chun, ram awptu Nehemia le thiempu le lekhaziektu ni fâwm Ezra le mipuihai inchûktirtu Levi mihai chun mipui po po kuoma chun, “Vawisûn ni hi LALPA in Pathien ta dinga ni inthieng a nih; lungriemin thlâk naw sienla cheu, ṭap khawm ṭap bawk naw ro,” an tih a. Dân thu chu an hrietin mipui po po chu an ṭap an ṭap el sih a."
"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah, “Fe unla, a thâu thâu fa unla, a thlum thlum dâwn unla, ieng- khawm buotsai nei lohai ta dingin chanpuol inphur unla, vawisûn ni hi ei LALPA ta dinga ni inthieng a ni hi; lungngaiin um naw ro, LALPA chunga lâwmna chu in hrâtna a ni sih a,” a ta."
"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai chun, “To ṭawk ṭawk ro khai, vawisûn hi ni inthieng a ni sih a; lungngai khawm lungngai nuom naw ro,” tiin, mipui po po chu an sukto ta ṭhuop el a."
"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.","Chuongchun, thu a hrilfie chu an hrietthiem leiin mipui po po chu fa ding dâmin, dâwn ding dâmin, mi dang chanpuol thawn ding dâmin, hlimtaka um ding dâm chun an ṭîn ta vawng a."
"And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’ houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.","Chun, a ni hni ni chun sûngkaw tinrênga a luhai dâm, thiempuhai dâm, Levi mihai chu Dân thu inchûk ding bawk chun lekhaziektu Ezra kuoma chun an fe khâwm a."
"And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie hmanga zâwm dinga thu a pêk dâna chun thla sarina ruoiṭhe laia Israel thlahai sâwlbûka an um ding thu le,"
"and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.","an ziek anga, “Tlângah fe unla, oliv kauhai, oliv hlêm kauhai le inhmui kauhai, intûm kauhai dâm, thing lien taktak kauhai chu sâwlbûk bâwlna dingin va la ro,” tiin an khuo po poa le, Jerusalem khuoa chun an hrildar ding thu le, phuong vêl ding a ni thu dâm chu an tiem a."
"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.","Chuong ang chun mipuihai chu an va feh a, mi po poin an in chung- haia dâm, an kawthaia dâm, Pathien in kawta dâm, Tui kawtkhâr hmun lienna laia dâm, Ephraim kawtkhâr hmun lienna laia dâm sâwlbûk an bâwl seng a."
"And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.","Chun, sala suok pungkhâwm- hai po po chun sâwlbûk an siem a.

"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance.",ni tin a ṭantir nia inthawka a tâwp chenin Pathien Dân bua mi an tiem bawk a.

"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.","Chuongchun, chu thla ni sâwm- hni pali ni chun Israel thlahai chu bu ngheia, saiip puon sila an lua pilvut kai nungin an fe khâwm tâwl a."
"And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.","Chun, Israel hnam chu hnam danghai laia chun an insuktum a; an ngîr a, an suolnahai le an pi le puhai bawsietna thupha an chawi a."
"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.","Chun, mâni hmun sengah an ngîr a, chu ni hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat sûng chun LALPA an Pathien dân bu an tiem a; chun, hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat dang sung chun thupha an chawi a, LALPA an Pathien chu an biek a."
"Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai dawkân insânga chun Jesua, Bani, Kadmiel, Sebania, Bunni, Serebia, Bani, Kena- ni hai chu an ngîr a; inringtakin LALPA an Pathien chu an ko a."
"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.","Chuongchun, Levi mi, Jesua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hasabneia, Serebia, Hodia, Sebania le Pethahia hai chun an hril a, “Ngîr unla, LALPA in Pathien chu chatuona inthawka cha- tuon chenin inpâk ro khai; chun, chawimawina le inpâkna po po khawmin a phâk lo, i hming ropui chu inpâkin um raw se."
"Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.","“Nangma chau hi LALPA i na, vânhai vân le a sûnga um po pohai le, leihnuoi le a sûnga um po pohai leh, tuisuoriet le a sûnga umhai po po leh i siem a, a rêng chun i kawl ṭha hlak a; chun, vâna umhai chun chibai an bûk hlak che kha."
"Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,","Abram chu thlanga, Kaldai ram Ur khuoa inthawka ṭhuoi suoka, a hminga Abraham saktu, LALPA Pathien i nih;"
"and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.","chun, a lungril chu i hmaa chun ringumin i hriet a; Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Periz mihai, Jebus mihai, Girgas mihai ram chu ama kuoma pe dingin, a thlahai chena pe dingin thu i thlung a; chun, i thu chu i hlen bawk a, feltak i ni sih a."
"And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,","Aigupta rama kan pi le puhai rinumzie chu i hmu zing a, Tuisuoriet Sen kama an khêkri chu i hriet a;"
"and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day.","Pharao le a siehlawhai po po le, a rama mi po pohai chungah inchikna le thilmakhai în langtir a; chapotakin an chunga thil an thaw ti i hriet sih a, chuongchun, tu chen hin hming în siem tah a."
"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.","Chun, an hmaa chun tuisuoriet chu i sukṭheh a, chuongchun, hnuoi hulah tuisuoriet sûng chu an fe thleng a; anni hnawttuhai chu tui inthûktakah, tui nasataka lung pei lût ang elin i pei lût a."
"Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.","Sûna chun sûm ngîrin i ṭhuoi hlak a, zâna khawm an fena ding lampuia anni ên dingin meichawk ngîrin i ṭhuoi hlak."
"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,","Sinai tlânga chun i hung ṭum bawk a, vâna inthawkin an kuoma chun thu i hril a; rorêlna indiktakhai dâm, dân indiktakhai dâm, thuruot le thupêk ṭha takhai chu i pêk a;"
"and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,","i châwlni inthieng chu anni în hriettir a, i siehlaw Mosie hmangin thupêk dâm, thuruot dâm, dân dâm i pêk a;"
"and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.","an phîngṭam sukrena dingin vâna inthawkin bei i pêk a, an dang- châr sukrêna dingin lungpuia in- thawkin tui i suksuokpêk a, i bân phar meua, ‘Pêng ka tih,’ i ti ram hluo ding thu i pêk a."
"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,","Nisienlakhawm, anni le kan pi le puhai chun, chapotakin thil an thawh a, an insukkâwmawh a, i thu- pêk chu an pawm nawh a,"
"and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.","an awi nuom nawh a, anni laia i thilmak thawhai khawm chu an hriet nuom ta bawk nawh a; an insuk- kâwmawh a, an helin an suok nina tienga lêt nâwk dingin hotu an ruot lem a; amiruokchu, nang chu ngai- dam dinga inzosa zing Pathien, mi lunginsiet thei, lainatnaa sip, lung inuoi, zainêmna hau i na, anni chu i nghatsan chuong nawh a."
"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;","Anih, an ta dingin bâwngtê lim an siem a, ‘Hi hi a nih, Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoisuoktu che i pathien chu,’ an tih a, lunginsenumtak thil an thaw lai khawm khan,"
"yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.","i lunginsietna nasatak chun thlalêra khan i thlathlam chuong nawh a: lampuia anni ṭhuoi dinga an chunga sûm ngîr chun sûnah anni a mâksan chuong nawh a, anni ên ding le an fena lampui khîkhmu dinga meichawk ngîr khawm chun zânah a fesan bawk nawh."
"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.","Anni inchûktir dingin i thlarau ṭhatak chu i pêk bawk a, i manna chu an baua a lût i phal naw nawh a, an dangchâr sukrêna dingin tui i pêk a."
"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.","Anih, thlalêra khan kum sâwm- li i châwm a, iengkhawm an tlasam nawh a; an silfênhai chu a hlui nawh a, an kehai khawm chu ân vûng bawk nawh a."
"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.","Chun, ram le hnamhai i pêk a, chuonghai chu an chanpuol i sempêk seng a; chuongchun, Sihon ram Hesbon lal ram le, Basan lal Og ram chu an hluoh a."
"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.",An thlahai chu vâna arasi zâtin i sukpung bawk a; an hluo dinga an pi le puhai kuoma i lo hril tah rama chun i ṭhuoi lût tah a.
"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.","Chuongchun, an thlahai chun ram chu an hluo tah a, chun, nangin chu rama um Kanaan mihai chu an hmaah i suktlâwm a, an nuom nuom an law dingin an lalhai le chu rama mihai le chun an kutah i pêk a."
"And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.","Kulnei khawpuihai le ram ṭhatak takhai chu an lâk a, thilṭha tinrênga sip inhai chu an hluoh a, tuikhur huotsa hai, grêp huonhai, oliv huon dâm, thei kûng tamtakhai chu an nei a; chuongchun, an fâk a, an khawp a, an hung thâu a, i ṭhatna nasataka chun nuom an chên a."
"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations.","Nisienlakhawm, an hung kâw- mawh a, i chungah an hel a, i Dân chu an hnungsawn dai a, nangma tieng innghattir nâwk tumtu i zâwlneihai chu an that a, lungsenumtak tak thilhai an thawh a."
"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.","Chuleichun, anni sukrinumtu an hmêlmahai kuta chun i pêk a; an lunginzîng laia an ko lai che khan vâna inthawk chun i lo ngai a; i zainêmna nasatak chun an hmêlma- haia inthawkin sansuoktu ding sandamtuhai i pêk a."
"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,","Nisienlakhawm, râlmuonga an hung um hnung chun i mithmuah thil ṭha naw an thaw nâwk el a: chuleiin, an hmêlmahai kutah i pêk a; chuongchun, an chungah thu an nei a; nisienlakhawm, an hung inleta an ko lai che khan vâna inthawkin i lo ngai a; vawi tamtak i zainêmna chun i sansuok a."
"and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.","“I dâna i ṭhuoi lût thei nâwkna dingin i kâwk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, chapotakin thil an thawh a, i thupêk- hai an pawm nawh a, i rorêlna kalin thil an suksuol a; (miin an zâwma an hringpui ding chu); chun, an tuk- hnungkhur an innghat a, an insuk- kâwmawh a, an ngai nuom nawh a."
"Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.","Nisienlakhawm, kum tamtak anni chu i dawh a, i thlaraua i zâwl- neihai hmangin i kâwk hlak a; nisien- lakhawm, an na an suksêt a; chuleiin, chu rama mihai kuta chun i pêk tah a."
"Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.","Nisienlakhawm, i zainêmna na- satak chun an tâwp sawng elna ding chu în tlungtir nawh a; i thlathlam chuong bawk nawh, Pathien mi lunginsiet theitak, lainatnaa sip i ni sih a."
"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.","Chuleiin, kan Pathien, Pathien ropui, iengkim thawthei le ṭium, thuthlung hlena lunginsietna suk- langtu chun keini chunga le kan lalhai, kan mi lienhai dâm, kan thiempuhai dâm, kan zâwlneihai dâm, kan pi le puhai le i mihai po po chungah, Assuria lalhai inlal laia inthawka tu chena rinumna hung tlung zozai hi thil chîn thamah ngai nawh rawh."
"Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;","Iengkhawm ni sienla kan chunga thil hung tlung po poa hin, nang chu i fel a; nang chun indiktakin thil i thawh a, keini ruok chun ṭha naw takin kan thaw a nih;"
"neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them.","kan lalhai dâm, kan mi lienhai dâm, kan thiempuhai dâm, kan pi le kan puhai khawmin i Dân chu an zâwm nawh a, i thupêk le i thuin- hriettir, anni i kâwknahai chu an pawm bawk nawh."
"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.","An chunga i ṭhat thei vei leh, an ramah, ram lientak le ram ṭhatak i pêka chun i rawng an bâwlpêk si naw cheh a, an thil suksuol khawm an bân chuong bawk nawh."
"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.","Ngai ta, tu hlak hin mi salhai kan ni chu a ni el tah a; ram, a sûng thil ra le, thil ṭha kan pi le puhai fâk dinga i pêk hlak chu, ngai ta, chutaka chun salhai kan ni el tah a."
"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.","Kan suol leia kan chunga lal dinga i ruothai hlak chun an neinung phah a, kan taksa chunga le kan ranhai chung takngiela khawm an nuom nuomin thu an nei a, kan lunginzîng êm êm el a nih,” tiin."
"And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal unto it.","Chuong po po lei chun thu dettak kan thlung a, kan ziek a, kan mi lienhai, kan Levi mihai le kan thiempuhaiin an namdetpui a."
