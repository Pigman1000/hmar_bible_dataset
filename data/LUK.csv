"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,","Eini laia kha thil hung tlung kha mi tamtakin ziek an tum tah a,"

"There was in the days of Herod, king of Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.","Judai ram lal Herod a dam laiin, Abija pâwla mi a hming Zakaria, thiempu pakhat a um a. Ama chun Aron thlaa mi nuhmeiin a nei a, a hming chu Elizabeth a nih."
"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.","An pahni chun Pathien mit- hmuah feltakin an um a, sawisêlboin Lalpa thupêk le a dân po po zâwmin an um hlak."
"And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.","Nisienlakhawm, Elizabeth chu a ching leiin nau an nei nawh a, an pahni chun upatak an ni sih a."
"Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,","Chun, a pâwlhai thaw dân ang peia Pathien hmaa thiempu sin a thaw laiin,"
"according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.",thiempu dân angin Lalpa biekina lût le riminhnik raw sin a chang a.
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.,"Chun, riminhnik chu a raw hun laiin mipui chu an rêngin tuolah an ṭawngṭai a."
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.,"Chun, Lalpa vântirko pakhat thil riminhnik râwna mâichâm changtieng chun a hung inlâr a."
"And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.","Chun, Zakaria chun a hmu phingleh a lunginzîng a, ṭi khawm a ṭih a."
"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.","Nisienlakhawm, vântirko chun a kuomah, “Zakaria, ṭi naw, i hni kha hriet a nih, i nuhmei Elizabethin naupasal neipêk a ti che, a hmingah Johan i sak ding a nih."
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.,"Chun, nang hlimin lâwm i ta, ama a pieng chun mi tamtak lâwm bawk an tih."
"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.","Lalpa ngaiin mi lien nîng a ta, uoin le zu hrim hrim dâwn naw ni; a nu phing sûnga inthawkin Thlarau Inthiengin hung sip a tih,"
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God.,Israel thlahai tamtak Lalpa an Pathien kuom tieng innghattir nâwk a tih.
"And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.","Chun, pahai lungril chu nauhai tienga innghattir ding dâm, mi kâwmawhai chu mi feltak varna tienga innghattir ding dâm, Lalpa ta dinga mihai lo buotsai dingin Elija lungril le thilthawtheina putin Lalpa hmaah fêng a tih,” a ta."
"And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.","Chun, Zakariain vântirko kuomah chun, “Chu chu iengtin am hrieng ka ta? kei putar ka na, ka nuhmei khawm pitar a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.","Vântirko chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Gabriel, Pathien hmaa ngîr hlak ka na; a be ding che le, chuong thu ṭha chu hril ding chea hung tir ka nih."
"And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.","Ngai rawh, ka thu hrilhai, a hun taka hung tlung ding chu i awi naw leiin chuong thil chu a hung tlung hmakhat chu to zing i ta, ṭawng thei naw ti ni,” a tih a."
"And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.","Chun, mipuihai chun Zakaria chu an lo nghâk a, Pathien biekin sûnga a um sâwt lei chun mak an ti hleh a."
"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.","Chun, a hung suok chun an kuomah thu a hril thei ta nawh a; chuongchun, biekinah inlârna a hmu a nih ti an hriet tah a; anni chu kut zaizirin a biek hlak a, chun ṭawng thei loin a um ta zing a."
"And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.","Chun, a rawngbâwlna ni chu a kim phingleh a inah a fe tah a."
"And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,","Chu hnunga chun a nuhmei Elizabeth chu a hung inrai a, thla nga ân thup a."
"Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.","“Mi kuoma ka hming sie inkhumna dingin, Lalpain a mi hmuh a, hieng ang hin a mi thawpêk a ni hi,” a ta."
"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,","Chun, a thla ruknaa chun Pathienin vântirko Gabriel chu Galili rama khuo pakhat Nazareth an tia chun,"
"to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.",nunghâk inthieng pakhat kuomah a tir a; ama chu David thlaa mi a hming Josef nuhmei huol a na; chu nunghâk hming chu Mari a nih.
"And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee.","Chun, vântirko chu a kuomah a lût a, “Chibai, Vochuom, Lalpa i kuomah a um” a ta."
"But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.","Chun, chu thu hril lei chun a lunginzîng ta bêk bêk a, “Iengtiziea chibai a mi bûk am nîng a tih aw,” tiin ân ngaituoh a."
"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.","Chun, vântirko chun a kuomah, “Mari, ṭi naw, Pathien ngaisak zâwng i nih."
"And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.","Ngai rawh, inrai i ta, naupasal nei i ta, a hminga chun Isu i sak ding a nih."
"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:","Ama chu mi lien la nîng a ta, Achunghnungtak Naupa tîng an tih; Lalpa Pathienin a thlatu David ṭhungpha chu pêng a ta;"
and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.,"Jakob thlahai chungah cha- tuonin inlal a ta, a ramin tâwp ni nei naw ni,” a ta."
"And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?","Chun, Mari chun vântirko kuomah chun, “Chuong chu iengtin am ni thei a ti leh, pasal ka nei si nawh a?” a ta."
"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.","Chun, vântirko chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Thlarau Inthieng i chungah hung tlung a ta, Achung- hnungtak thilthawtheina chun hlie- khûng a che; chuleiin, naupang hung pieng ding khawm chu mi inthieng, Pathien Naupa tîng an tih."
"And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren.","Chun, ngai ta, i zuorpuinu Elizabeth khawmin tar hnungin naupasal a vawn tah a; a ching an ti hlak kha, tuta thla hi a thla rukna a ni tah."
For no word from God shall be void of power.,"Pathien ta ding chun thaw thei naw iengkhawm a um si nawh a,” a ta."
"And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.","Chun, Marin, “Ngai ta, Lalpa suoknu ka nih, i hril ang tak chun ka chungah tlung raw se,” a ta. Chun, vântirko chun a fe san tah a."
"And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;","Chuong lai chun Mari chu a tho a, thingtlângah, Judai rama khuo pakhata chun a fe tah a;"
and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.,"chun, Zakaria inah a lût a, Elizabeth chibai a bûk a."
"And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;","Chun, Elizabethin Mari chibai bûk chu a hriet phingleh, a phîng sûnga naute chu a châng a; chun, Elizabeth chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip tah a;"
"and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.","râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Nang chu nuhmei lai poah inpâktlâk i nih; i rîla ra khawm inpâktlâk a nih."
"And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me?",Ka Lalpa nu ka kuoma i hung hi iengtizie am a na?
"For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.","Ngai ta, i chibai bûk ri ka naah a lût phingleh a lâwm leiin nautê ka phîng sûngah ân châwm a nih."
And blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.,"A kuoma Lalpân thu a hril kha a tlung ding a ni ti ringnu chu a hamṭha,” a ta."
"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,","Chun, Marin, “Ka hringnân Lalpa a chawimawi a,"
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.,"Ka thlarau khawm a mi sandamtu Pathien chungah a lâwm bêk bêk a,"
"For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid: For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.","A suoknu tlâwmzie a hmuh a, a lunginsiet a, Ngai rawh, tuta inthawkin ruolthar po poin hamṭha an mi ti ding a nih."
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; And holy is his name.,"Mi hrât khan ka chungah thil ropuitak a mi thawpêk a,"
And his mercy is unto generations and generations On them that fear him.,"A hming khawm ân thieng a nih, A ṭituhai chu suon po po chenin a lunginsiet pei hlak."
He hath showed strength with his arm; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.,"A bânin a tha hrâtzie ân entir a, An inngaituonaa chapohai chu a sukdar tah a."
"He hath put down princes from their thrones, And hath exalted them of low degree.",An ṭhungphaa lal inṭhunghai chu a hnûk thlâk a. Mi inhnuoihai chu a dawm sâng tah a.
The hungry he hath filled with good things; And the rich he hath sent empty away.,"Phîng ṭamhai chu thil ṭhatakin a sukkhawp tah a, Hausahai chu kutruokin ân fe hmangtir tah a."
"He hath given help to Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy","A siehlaw Israelhai chu a sawmdâwl tah a, Ei thlatuhai kuoma a lo hril ta ang ngei khan;"
(As he spake unto our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.,"Abraham le a thlahai chu chatuona a lunginsiet dingzie hriet zingna dingin,” a ta."
"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.","Chun, Mari chu thla thum lai a kuomah a um a; chun, a in tieng a fe nâwk tah a."
Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.,"Chun, Elizabeth nau nei chu a hung hun tah a; naupasal a nei tah a."
And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.,"Chun, a vênghai le a laibunghai chun, Lalpân a lunginsiet ti an lo hriet a, an lâwmpui a."
"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.","Chun, ni riet nia chun nautê ser tan dingin an hung a; a hmingah a pa hming bawk, Zakaria sak an tum a."
"And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.","Nisienlakhawm, a nu chun, “Ni lo e, ama chu Johan sak lem ding a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.","Chun, annîn a kuomah, “I laibunghai lai hi hming put hi tukhawm an um lêm,” an ta."
"And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.","Chun, a pa kuoma chun kut zaizirin, “A hmingah ieng am sak inla i nuom a?” an ta."
"And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.","Chun, lekha ziekna lung phêk a hnih a, “A hming Johan a nih,” tiin a ziek a. An rêngin mak an ti hleh a."
"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, blessing God.","Chun, kârloin a lei le a bau chu a hung insût a. Pathien inpâkin a hung ṭawng suok tah a."
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa.,"Chun, an vêla umhai po po chun an ṭi tah a. Chun, chuong thu chu Judai ram thingtlâng po poah ân thang tah a."
"And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.","A hre taphawt chun an lungrilah lungkhamah an nei a, “Chu nautê chu iengtin takin am la hung um a tih aw,” an ta; Lalpa kutin ama a ṭhangpui sih a."
"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,","Chun, a pa Zakaria chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, a hrillâwk a,"
"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,","“Lalpa Israel Pathien chu, inpâkin um raw se, A mihai chu a hung kan a, intlanna a siempêk a,"
And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David,"A siehlaw David sûnghai lai chun, Sandamna ki a mi siempêk ta sih a;"
"(As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),",(Leihnuoi insieng tîra a zâwlnei inthienghai baua a hril ang khan).
"Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;",Ei hmêlmahai le a mi theidatuhai po po kuta inthawka mi sansuok dinga a lo intiem thu dâm;
"To show mercy towards our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;","Ei thlâtuhai kuoma a ngilneina suklang a lo tiem thu le, A thuthlung inthieng hre zing dingin,"
"The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father,",Chu thuthlung chu inkhâmin ei thlâtu Abraham kuomah a lo tiem tah a;
"To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear,","Chuongchun, ei hmêlmahai kuta inthawka mi sanhimin, ṭi loa a rawng ei bâwl theina ding le,"
In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.,"Ei dam sûnga a mithmua inthieng le feltaka ei um zing theina ding chu, a mi hung ruotpêk ta a nih."
"Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High: For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;","Anih, Bawipu, nang hi Achunghnungtak zâwlnei tîng an ti che. A lampuihai siem dingin Lalpa hmaah i fe ding a ni sih a;"
"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins,","An suolhai ngaidamna dinga, A mihai kuoma sandamna thu inhriettir dingin;"
"Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,","Ei Pathien lunginsietna leiin, Chungtienga inthawkin nisa suokin mi hung sir a ta,"
To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace.,"Inthim lai le thina hlima inṭhunghai ên ding le, Thlamuongna lampuia ei kehai mîn pêntir dingin,” tiin."
"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.","Chun, nautê chu a hung lien deu deu a, a thlarau tieng a hung hrât ta deu deu a, Israelhai kuoma a hung insuklang hmakhat chu thlalêrah a um zing a."
"Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.","Chu zoa chun Lalpân mi dang sâwmsari a ruot a, a fena ding khaw tina le hmun tinah, a hmaah pahni peiin a tir a."
"And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.","Chun, an kuomah, “Bu sîk ding a tam hleh a, nisienlakhawm, a sin- thawtuhai an tlâwm; chuongchun, a bu sîk dinga sinthawtuhai ding tir dingin bu Neitupa kuoma chun ngên ro."
"Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.","“Fe ro, ngai ta u, satene laia berâmte um angin ka tir cheu hi."
"Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.","Tangka ip dâm, mansa dâm, kekawk dâm, chawi naw ro, lampuiah tukhawm chibai bûk naw ro."
"And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house.","Chun, in in lûtna taphawtah a hmasatakin, ‘Hi ina hin thlamuongna tlung raw se,’ ti ro."
"And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.","Chun, chutaka chun thlamuong nau a um chun in thlamuongna thu chu a chungah um zing a tih; a um naw ruok chun in chungah hung kîr nâwk a tih."
"And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.","Chu ina chun um zing unla, an pêk taphawt cheu chu fain dâwn unla, sinthawtu chu hlaw hmu tlâk a nih. In tinah fe lâwr naw ro."
"And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:","“Chun, khuo in lûtna taphawtah an lâwm cheu chun an pêk ang ang cheu chu fa ro;"
"and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.","an khuoa damnaw umhai khawm sukdam unla, an kuomah, ‘Pathien ram in kuomah a tlung tah,’ ti ro."
"But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,","Khuo in lûtna taphawtah an lâwm naw cheu ruok chun, an kawtthlêrahai fe suok unla,"
"Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.","‘In khaw pilvut kan kephaa kai khawm hi in chungah kan hrûk fai hi; nisienlakhawm, Pathien ram in kuomah a hung tlung tah ti hi hre ro,’ ti ro."
"I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.","Ka ti cheu hi, chu nia chun chu khuohai tuor nêk chun Sodom khaw tuor ding chu a zie um lem a tih."
"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","“Korazin i chung a rik! Bethsaida, i chung a rik! Nangnia thil maktak thawa umhai kha Tura le Sidona thaw ni sienla, saiip puon sila vut laia ṭhungin sim dai tâng an tih."
"But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.","Nisienlakhawm, ngaituo nia chun nangni tuor nêk chun Tura le Sidon tuor ding chu a zie um lem a tih."
"And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.","Chun, nang Kapernaum, vân chenin chawimawi i ni ding am a nih? Mithi khuo chena nam thlâk i ni ding i sawnnaw."
He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.,"“Tûkhawm nangni thu ngai chu keima thu ngai a nih; tûkhawm a dit naw cheu chu kei a mi dit naw a nih; tûkhawm kei mi dit naw chu a mi tirtu dit naw a nih,” a ta."
"And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.","Chun, sâwmsarihai chu lâwm- takin an hung a, “Lalpa, khawhrihai khawm i hming leiin kan thu thuin an um,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Kâwlinlep angin Setan vâna in- thawka hung tla kha ka hmu annaw."
"Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.","Ngai ta u, rûlhai le ainuvêthai sirdena thu le, hmêlma thuneina po po letthlâkna thu ka pêk cheu hi; iengkhawmin sukna naw tawp a cheu."
"Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.","Nisienlakhawm, khawhrihai in thu thua an um leiin lâwm naw ro; vâna in hming ziek a ni leiin lâwm lem ro,” a ta."
"In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.","Chun, chu lai tak chun Isu chu Thlarau Inthiengah a lâwm bêk bêk a, “Aw Pa, hnuoi le vân Lalpa, nangin mi var le mi bengvârhai kuomah hieng thu hi i ip a, nautêhai kuomah i phuong lei hin kân pâk che; anih, Pa, chuong anga thaw chu i ngaiin a ṭha a nih."
"All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him.","Ka Pain iengkim a mîn kawltir tah, Naupa chu tû am a na, Pa naw chun tukhawmin an hriet nawh; Pa khawm chu tû am a ni Naupa le an kuomah Naupain a phuong nuomnahai chau naw chun tukhawmin an hriet nawh,” a ta."
"And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:","Chun, inchûktirhai kuom tieng chu a nghah a, inrûkin, “In thil hmuhai hi a hmûna mithai chu a vângnei ie!"
"for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.","Ka ti cheu hi, zâwlnei tamtak le, lal tamtakhai khawmin in thil hmuhai hi hmu an inhâwk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, an hmu si nawh; naa in hriethai khawm hi hriet an nuom hlak, nisienlakhawm, an hriet si naw a nih,” a ta."
"And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","Chun, ngai ta, dân hretu tû amanih a ngîr a, ama infiena dingin, “Inchûktirtu, chatuona hringna neina dingin ieng am ka thaw ding?” a ta."
"And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Dân lekhabuah ieng am ziek a na? chutaka chun ieng am i tiem hlak a?” a ta."
"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.","Chun, ama chun, “ ‘Lalpa i Pa- thien chu i lungril po poin, i thlarau po poin, i hrâtna po poin, i lungvar po poin i hmangai ding a nih’; ‘Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai khawm i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.","Ama chun a kuomah, “I dawn dik ngawt el ie; chuong ang chun thaw la hring i tih,” a ta."
"But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?","Ama ruok chun thiem inchang- tir a tum a, Isu kuomah, “Anleh, ka vênghai chu tuhai am an na?” a ta."
"Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.","Isûn a dawn a, “Tû amanih Jerusalema inthawkin Jerikoah a zu fe ding a na, suomhmanghai ân tuokpui hlau a, chuhai chun a silfên an hlîppêk vawng a, an vuok hrep a, thi vâng vângin an fe san tah a."
"And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.","Chun, thiempu tû amanih chu lampuia chun a zu fe kher a, a hmu phingleh lampui sîr khat tieng a hêl el tah a."
"And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.","Chun, chuong ang bawkin Levi chi mi pakhat khawm chu hmun chu a hung tlung a, a hmu phingleh lam- pui sîr khing tieng a hêl ve el tah a."
"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,","Amiruokchu, Samari rama mi tû amanih ân zin fe hin a umna chu a hung tlung a, a hmu phingleh a lunginsiet bêk bêk a."
"and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.","A kuomah a va feh a, a pawpahai chun hriek le uoin dâm a nâl a, a tuom a, ama sa chungah ân chuongtir a, khuolbûkah a fepui a, a enkawl tah a."
"And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.","Chun, a zînga chun duli pahni a kei dawk a, khuolbûk vêngtu kuomah a pêk a, ‘Lo enkawl la, hi bâka i sêng po chu ka hung kîr nâwk pha hung thung ka ti che,” a ta."
"Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?",“Chuhai pathum laia chun suomhmang tuokpa vênghai chu a tû tak chu am ni dingin i ring a?” a ta.
"And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.","Ama chun, “Ama lunginsiettu chu,” a ta. Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Nang khawm chuong ang bawk chun va thaw ve rawh,” a ta."
"Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.","Chun, an inzin malamin khaw ienga manih a lût a; chun, nuhmei pakhat a hming Marthain a lo intlungtir a."
"And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.","Ama chun zuorpui pakhat a nei a, Mari a na; ama chu Lalpa ke bulah a ṭhung a, a thu a ngai a."
"But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.","Martha ruok chu rawngbâwl ngawtin a buoi hleh a; chuongchun, a kuomah a hung a, “Lalpa, ka zuorpuinu hin keia khât chau rawng bâwl dinga a mi dânde hi pawi i ti naw am a nih? mi ṭhangpui dingin hril raw khai,” a ta."
"But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:","Chun, Lalpain, “Martha, Martha, thil tamtak i ngaituoa i buoi a ni hi,"
"but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.","thil pakhat chau a pawimaw; Mariin chan ṭha a thlang a, chu chu lâkpêk ding a ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.","Chun, Isu khâwlai hmuna manih a ṭawngṭai a, a ṭawngṭai zo chun a închûktir mi pakhatin a kuomah, “Lalpa, ṭawngṭai dân Johanin a închûktirhai ân chûktir ang khan mîn chûktir ve ta la,” a ta."

And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.,"Kan suolhai mi ngaidam la, Keini khawmin kan iengkhat battuhai po po kan ngaidam hlak a nih. Thlêmnaa chun mi ṭhuoi lût naw rawh,’ tiin,” a ta."
"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Nangni laia tûin amanih ruol nei sienla, zânrilah a kuomah fein, ‘Ruola, beiphêk pathum mîn pûktir rawh;"

"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?","Chuongchun, nangni mi suol hmanin in nauhai thil ṭha pêk na- châng in hriet chun, in Pa vâna mi chun a hnituhai chu Thlarau Inthieng a va pêk âwm ngei deh e!” a ta."
"And he was casting out a demon that was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.","Chun, Isûn khawhri ṭawngthei- naw pakhat a hnawt dawk a.

"And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.","Setan khawm ama le ama ân do chun, a ram iengtin am ngîr suok a ta?"
"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.","Chun, kei Beelzebub leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka lo ni chun, in nauhaiin tû leiin am an hnawt dawk hlak a le? Chuleiin, anni chu nangni ngaituotu dinghai nîng an tih."

"The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out.","“Khawhri inthieng naw chu mi sûnga inthawka a suokin, châwlna zawngin tui um nawna hmunahai ân vâk a.

"And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin, mipui laia nuhmei pakhat a khêk suok a, a kuomah, “Nangma vawnna phîng chu a hamṭha ie, i nêne nêk khawm,” a ta."

"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.","“Simtieng lalnu kha ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai kuoma hin tho vêng a ta., thiemnaw inchangtir a tih; Solomon var ngai ding hmanin kâwlkawdawnga in- thawkin a hung sih a; ngai ta u, Solomon nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um."
"The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.","“Ninevi khuoa mihai chu ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai lai hin ngîr vêng an ta, thiemnaw inchangtir an tih, Jona thu hril leiin an sim sih a; ngai ta u, Jona nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um annâwm."
"No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light.","“Tukhawmin khâwnvar an sitin in hnuoi kilah an sie ngai nawh, leikhâwr hnuoiah an sie ngai bawk nawh, mi lûthai chun a var an hmu theina dingin a sienaa chun an sie lem hlak a nih."
"The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.","“I taksa khâwnvar chu i mit a nih, i mit a var chun i taksa khawm apumin a var suok hlak; a se ruok chun i taksa khawm ân thim zo vawng hlak."
Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness.,"Chuongchun, i sûnga var um chu inthim a lo ni el râwm, fîmkhur rawh."
"If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light.","Chuongchun, i taksa hi khâwlai khawm inthim loa a puma a var suok chun, khâwnvar var nasatakin a el che angin var suok a tih,” a ta."
"Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.","Chun, a hril laiin, Pharisai pakhatin ama chu a kuoma bu fa dingin a fiel a; chuongchun, a lût a, buthlêng chu a awt a."
"And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.","Chun, Pharisai chun bu fâk hmaa a kut a sâwp naw chu a hmuin mak a ti hleh a."
"And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.","Chun, Lalpa chun a kuomah, “Nangni Pharisaihaiin no le thlêng puo tieng chu in sâwp fai hlak luoh a; in sûng tieng ruok chu hlêprûkna le suolin a sip sih a."

"Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.","In chung a rik ie! Zâwlneihai thlân inhai in bâwl hlak a, in thlatuhai ithat an ni sih a."
"So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build their tombs.","Chuongchun, in thlatuhai thil- thawhai chu in hrietpuiin in remtipui a nih; annîn an that a, nangnîn an thlân inhai in bâwl sih a."

"And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;","Chun, chutaka inthawka a suok chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai chun an tai ta rân a, thu tinrêng an inhriltir a;"

"In the mean time, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.","Chu sûnga mipui sâng tamtak insir nuk nuk khawp hiel an hung inkhâwm chun, Isûn a hmasatakin a închûktirhai kuomah, “Pharisaihai chawl, vervêknaa in- thawk chun fîmkhur ro."

Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.,"Chuleiin, inthima in hril taphawt kha varah la hrieng an tih; pindan sûngrila, na bula in thu hril kha in chunga chuongin la khêkpui an tih."

but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God.,"Nisienlakhawm, mihai hmaa mîn phat chu Pathien vântirkohai hmaah inphat ni vêng a tih."
"And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.","Chun, Mihriem Naupa sawisêl chu a sawisêlna chu ngaidam nîng a tih; Thlarau Inthieng meu hrilse ruok chu a hrilsietna chu ngaidam ni naw nih."

"And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:","Chun, an kuomah tekhithu a hril a, “Mi hausa tû amanih a lohma a hung hlâwk bêk bêk a."
"and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits?","Chuongchun, ân ngaituoh a, ‘Iengtin am thâwng ka tih aw? ka bu le bâl sie khâwmna ka nei si nawh a,’ a ta."
"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods.","Chun, ‘Hieng hin thâwng ka tih; ka bu inhai ṭhiek ka ta, a nêka lienin bâwl ka tih; chutaka chun ka bu le ka sum po po sie khâwm ka tih."

"But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin a kuomah, ‘Invêt, vawizân hin i thlarau an hni ding che a nih; i thil suksuokhai kha tû ta am ni tâng a ta le?’” a ta."
"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.","“Mâni ta dinga sum inkhâwl a, Pathien tienga hau si naw chu, chuong ang chu a ni hlak,” a ta."
"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.","Chun, a inchûktirhai kuomah, “Chuleiin, ka hril cheu hi, ‘Ieng am fâng ka ta aw?’ tiin in hringna thu le, ‘Ieng am silin bil ka ta aw?’ tiin in taksa thu lungkham naw ro."
"For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment.","Fâk ding nêkin hringna a thupui lem a nih, silfên nêk khawmin taksa a thupui lem a nih."
"Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds!","Vaâkhai hi ngaituo ro, bu an tu ngai nawh, an sîk ngai nawh, bupanghai, bu inhai khawm an nei nawh; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin a châwm sih a; nangni chu vatehai nêk chun in hlut lemzie chu."
And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life?,"Chun, nangni lai lungkham leiin tûin am mâni dung tieng tawng khata suksâng chuong thei um cheu?"
"If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest?","Hi el khawm hi thaw thei lo cheu a, iengdinga thil dang in lungkham am a na?"
"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","“Tûktinpâr inṭhangzie hi ngai- tuo ro; sin an thaw nawh, pat khawm an kher ngai nawh; nisienlakhawm, ka hril cheu hi, Solomon meu khawm a ropuina po poa ân thuom khan, hieng tûktinpâr pakhat tluk khawm hin cheiin a um nawh."
"But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more shall he clothe you, O ye of little faith?","Chuongchun, ram sâwlhna vawisûn anga hring, a zînga thuka ti nâwk el ding hman, Pathienin chuong ang lâwma a chei chun, aw, nangni ringna tlâwmhai, chuonghai nêk chun silfên a va pêk âwm cheu deh e!"

For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.,"Khawvêla hnam po poin chuong po po chu an zawng hlak, chuong chu in mamaw ti in Pa vâna miin a hriet zing sih a."

"Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning;","“Dier kei zingin, in khâwnvar khawm chawk zingin um ro;"

"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.","Indiktakin ka hril cheu hi, a nei po po chunga hotuah siem a tih."
"But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;","Amiruokchu, chu suok chun, a lungrilin ‘Ka pu hung vak naw ni,’ tiin suoknuhai, suokpahai lo vaw sienla, fain dâwnin lo inrui ta sienla;"

"And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;","Suok a pu dit zâwng hre zing sia, lo inring loa, a pu dit zâwng ang khawma thaw lo chu, vawi tamtak vuong an tih."
"but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.

And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.,"Chun, Châwlni chun ama chun inkhâwmna in pakhatah ân chûktir a."
"And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up.","Chun, ngai ta, kum sâwmpariet hrâtnawna khawhri iman nuhmei pakhat a um a; ama chu a kûn zing a, a khât chun a ngîr tlûn thei nawh a."

"And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.","Chun, a chungah a kut ân nghat a; chuongchun, kârloin a ngîr tlûn nghâl tah a, Pathien ân pâk tah a."
"And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.","Chun, Isûn Châwlniin mi a sukdam leiin inkhâwmna in hotu chu a lunginsen a, mipui chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Mihriem sinthawna ding ni ruk a um annâwm; chu sûng chun hung unla, insukdam ro; Châwlnia hung loin,” a ta."
"But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?","Lalpa ruok chun a kuomah, “Nangni vervêkhai, Châwlniin mâni sebâwng amanih, sabengtung ama- nih a bu fâknaa inthawka sûtin, tui dâwn dingin in ṭhuoi dawk seng hlak a ni naw am a nih?"

"He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?","Chuongchun, ama chun, “Pathien ram chu iengang am a na? Ieng le hin am hrilkhîng ka ta?"
"It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof.","Anṭam chi mal khat miin a lâk a, huona a the ang chu a nih; chu chu a hung mâwng a, thing a hung na, chunga vatehai chu a zârahai chun an riek a,” a ta."
"And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?","Chun, “Pathien ram chu ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka ta?” a ti nâwk a."
"It is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.","“Chawl nuhmeiin a lâk a, beiphit tekhâwng thum laia a rênga a tho vawng chena a phûm ang chu a nih,” a ta."
"And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem.","Chun, ama chun inchûktir pei puma, Jerusalem tieng panin, khaw lien le khaw chînhai a sir pei a."
"And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved? And he said unto them,","Chun, tûin amanih a kuomah, “Sandamhai chu tlâwmterek am an nih?” a ta."
"Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Kawtkhâr chîna chun lût tum hrâm ro; ka hril cheu hi, mi tamtakin lût tum an ta, lût thei si naw ni hai."
"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;","In neitu chu a tho a, kawt a khâr hnung chun, nangnîn tuola ngîrin, ‘Lalpa, kawt mi hawngpêk rawh,’ tia kawtkhâr in hung nawk pha, ama chun, ‘Khâwtieng mi am in na, ka hriet naw cheu,’ tiin dawn a ti cheu."

"There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.","“Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai, zâwlnei po pohai chu Pathien ram sûnga um in hmua, nangni tuola hnawt suok in ni in inhriet pha, chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih."
"And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.","Chun, sak le thlang, sim le hmâra inthawkin hung an ta, Pathien ramah hung ṭhung an tih."
"And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.","Chun, ngai ta u, a nuhnung- takhai khawm a hmasataka um ding an um a, a hmasatakhai khawm, a nuhnungtaka um ding an um,” a ta."
"In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee.","Chuonglai tak chun Pharisai tuhai amanih an hung a, a kuomah, “Suok la, hitaka inthawkin fe hmang rawh; Herodin sukhlum che a nuom bêk bêk a nih,” an ta."

Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.,"Ieng khawm ni raw se, vawisûn leh, zînga leh, a zîngnâwk leh ka fe pei ding a nih; Jerusalem khaw puo tieng zâwlnei thi thei a ni nawh ie,” a ta."
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!","“Aw Jerusalem, Jerusalem! zâwlnei thattu, i kuoma an hung tirhai lunga lo dêng hlumtu; ârpuiin a têhai a thla hnuoia a awp khâwm angin, i nauhai vawi iengzât am awp khâwm ka tum kha!

"And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.","Chun, Châwlniin Pharisai hotu pakhat ina bu fa dinga a fe laiin, an enthlit a."
"And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy.","Chun, ngai ta, a hmaa chun damnaw invûng mi tû amanih a um a."
"And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?","Chuongchun, Isûn Dân inchûk- tirtuhai le Pharisaihai chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Châwlni hin sukdam a thieng am a thieng naw?” a ta."
"But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.","Anni ruok chu an to zing a; ama chun damnaw chu a chel a, a sukdam a, ân fetir tah a."
"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?","Chun, an kuomah, “Nangni lai in sabengtung amanih, sebâwng ama- nih, tuisunsuoah lo tla sien la, Châwlni khawmin tûin am kei suok nghâl nâwng in ta?” a ta."
And they could not answer again unto these things.,Chuong thu chu an dawn thei naw nâwk bawk a.
"And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them,","Chun, an mi fielhaiin ṭhungpha ṭhatak an thlang hlakzie a hmuh a, an kuomah tekhithu a hril tah a;"
"When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him,","“Inneina ruoiṭhe fa dingin tûin amanih a fiel pha che chun ṭhungpha ṭhatakah ṭhung naw rawh; chuong naw chun, i nêka mi ṭha lem lo fiel hlau a ta,"

"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee.","An fiel che chun ṭhungpha ṭha naw takah va ṭhung lem hlak rawh; chuongchun, a fieltu che a hung pha leh, i kuomah, ‘Ruola, ṭhungpha ṭha deua hin hung ṭhung rawh,’ ti thei a ti che.

For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.,"Inngaihlu taphawt chu tlâwm an ta; inngaitlâwm chu chawimawiin um an tih,” a ta."
"And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.","Chun, a fieltu kuoma khawm chun, “Sûna manih, zâna manih ruoi i ṭhe pha leh, i ruolhai, i unauhai, i laibunghai, i vêng hausahai chu fiel naw rawh; chuong naw chun, fiel ve nâwk an ti cheh a, thung nâwk kher an ti che."
"But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:","Ruoi i ṭhe pha chun, pasiehai, piengsuolhai, keinbaihai, mitdelhai fiel lem rawh;"
and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.,"chuongchun, la hamṭhâng i tih; anni chun thungna ding che nei naw ni hai a, chuongchun, mi fel tho nâwk pha chun thungin i um ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.","Chun, a thlaithlêng awtpui tûin amanih chuong chu a hriet a, a kuomah, “Pathien rama bu fa ding chu a hamṭha ie!” a ta."
"But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many:","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Mi tûin amanih ruoi ropuitak zânah a ṭheh a, mi tamtak a fiel a;"

"And they all with one consent began to make excuse.

"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.","Chun, mi dangin, ‘Sebâwng tuok nga kân châwk tah a, a sie le ṭha fie dingin ka fe ding a na, mi lungin- siet la mi hung inphatpêk rawh,’ a ta."
"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.","Chun, mi dangin, ‘Nuhmei ka nei tah a, chuleiin, ka hung thei nawh,’ a ta."
"And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.","Chun, suok chun a pu kuomah chuong thu chu a va hril a.

"And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room.","Chun, suok chun, ‘Pu i thu mi pêk ang khan ka thaw tah a, nisien- lakhawm, hmun a la chuong ta rawp,’ a ta."
"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain them to come in, that my house may be filled.","Chun, a puin suok kuoma chun, ‘Suok la, lamlienahai, khawhnâwma- hai fe la, ka in sipna dingin mî hung thlêm lût hrâm rawh."

"Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them,","Chun, mipui nasatak ama leh an fe veh a; chuongchun, ama chu a nghah a, an kuomah,"
"If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.","“Tûkhawm ka kuoma hung chun a pa dâm, a nu dâm, a nuhmei dâm, a nauhai, a unauhai, a farnuhai, ama hringna chenin a theida naw chun, ka închûktir ni thei naw ni."
"Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.","Tûkhawm mâni kraws puta mi zui naw chu, ka închûktir ni thei naw ni."
"For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have wherewith to complete it?","“Nangni laia tûkhawm hin in insâng bâwl tum unla, a tirin ṭhungin, bâwl zona khawp sum in nei le nei naw hre dingin, a man ding chin tuin am sût nâwng in ta?"
"Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him,","Chuong naw chun, lung phûm ta zeta a bâwl zo thei si naw chun, a en taphawtin nuisan an ta,"
"saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.","‘Hi mipa hin in ân kal zet a, a bâwl zo thei si nawh a,’ tîng an tih."
"Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?","“Chun, lal tûin am lal dang hung chu, mi sîng khat le a tuok ngam ding le ding naw, mi râwn nâwng a ta?"
"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.","Chuong a ni naw leh, lal dang chu hlataka a la um laiin, inremna tieng thutiem hni dingin palai tir a tih."
"So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni lai hin tûkhawm a nei po po mâksan naw chu, ka închûktir ni thei naw nih."
"Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?","“Machi hi a ṭha; nisienla- khawm, machi khawm a da ta chun, iengin am sukal nâwk an ta?"

"Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.","Ka hril cheu hi, chuong ang bawkin, mi suol pakhat sim chunga hin Pathien vântirkohai an lâwm hlak a nih."
"And he said, A certain man had two sons:",“Mi tûin amanih naupasal pahni a nei a;
"and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of thy substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.","chun, a naupang lem chun a pa kuomah, ‘Pa, ro ka chanâi mi pe rawh,’ a ta. Chuongchun, a sum chu an kuomah a sem tah a."
"And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.","Chun, ni sâwt nawtê hnunga chun a naupa naupang lem chun a chanâi po po chu a lâk khâwm vawng a, khaw ram hlatakah a fe tah a, chutaka chun inhawi taluoin a um a, a sum chu a sukthâm ta mei mei a."
"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.","Chun, a sukthâm vawng phing- leh, chu khuoa chun ṭâm nasatak a hung tla a; fâk ding a hung tlasam tah a."
And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.,"Chuongchun, chu ram mi-mi pakhat a va bêl a; chu mipa chun vawk bu pe dingin a lo tieng a tir a."
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.,"Chun, iengkhat kâwm vawkin an fâkhai chun insukkhawp a nuom bêk bêk a; tukhawmin iengkhawm an pêk si nawh."
"But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!","“Chun, ân hriet suok phingleh, ‘Ka pa kuoma inhlâwfahai bu fâk sêng loa nei an tam vei leh, kei hlak chu hitaka hin phîngṭâmin ka thi ding a ni sih a!"
"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:","Tho ka ta, ka pa kuomah fêng ka ta, Pa, vâna mi chunga le nanga mithmuin thil ka suksuol a."
I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.,"I naupaa înbûk tlâk khawm ka ni ta nawh; i kuoma inhlâwfa pakhat angin mi siem ve rawh, tîng ka tih,’ a ta."
"And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.","“Chuongchun, a tho a, a pa kuomah a fe tah a. Chuongchun, hlataka a la um laiin a pain a lo hmuh a, a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, a tlân a, a kuoh a, a fâwp ta ngâwi ngâwi a."
"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.","Chun, a kuomah a naupa chun, ‘Pa, vâna mi chungah le nanga mithmuin thil ka suksuol a; i naupaa inbûk tlâk ka ni ta nawh,’ a ta."
"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:","Nisienlakhawm, a pa chun a suokhai kuomah, ‘Puon ṭha tak kha hung la vat unla, insiltir ro; a kutah kutsebi dâm, a keah kekawk dâm inbuntir ro;"
"and bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:","sebâwngte thâu tak kha hung la unla, that ro, hlimtakin fâng ei tiu;"
"for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.","hi ka naupa hi a thih a, a hung hring nâwk tah a ni hi; ân hmang a, ei hmu nâwk tah a ni hi,’ a ta. Chuong- chun, hlimtakin an um ṭan tah a."
"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.","“Chun, a naupa upa lem chu loah a um a; chun, in a hung tlung tâwm chun iengkhat mûtrîk le lâm ri a hriet tah a."
"And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.","Chuongchun, siehlaw pakhat a ko a, ‘Chu ieng am a ni ta leh?’ tiin ân dawn a."
"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘I sang a hung a, himtaka a hmu nâwk leiin i pain sebâwngtê thâutak kha a that a nih,’ a ta."
"But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.","Chun, a lunginsen a, a lût nuom ta nawh a; chun, a pa a hung suok a, a thlêm a."
"But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a pa kuomah, ‘Ngai rawh, kum hieng chen hi i rawng ka bâwlpêk cheh a, i thu hlak hi ka awi naw ngai si nawh a, ka ruolhai le hlimna ka siemna dingin kêltê khawm i mi pêk ngai si nawh."
"but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf.","Nisienlakhawm, hi i naupa nawchizawrhai kâwla i sum fa zo vawngtu hi a hung phingleh ama ta dingin sebâwngtê thâutak kha i lo thatpêk vei a,’ a ta, a dawn a."
"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Ka naupa, ka kuoma um zing i nih annâwm; ka nei po po hi i ta a nih."
"But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.","Hlimtak le lâwmtaka um ding a ni hrim annâwm; hi i sang hi a thih a, a hung hring nâwk tah a; ân hmang a, ei hmu nâwk tah a ni sih a,’ a tih a,” a ta."
"And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.","Chun, Isûn a inchûktirhai kuomah hi thu khawm hi a hril a; “Mi hausa tuin amanih sum enkawltu a nei a; chu pa chun a sum a sukthâmpêk mei mei chungah a kuomah an hêk a."
"And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.","Chuongchun, ama chu a ko a, a kuomah, ‘I chungchâng thu ka hriet hi iengtizie am a na? I sum enkawl chanchin hung ziek vawng rawh; tuta hnung chu sum enkawltu hin ṭhang thei ta naw ti ni,’ a ta."
"And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.","“Chun, sum enkawltu chun, a lungrilin, ‘Ka puin ka sum enkawl a mi bân ding hi iengtin am thâw tâng ka ti aw? hnuoi cho ka pei si nawh a, kut daw hlak chu kân zak sih a."
"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.","Sum enkawl a mi bân phaa mîn an ina an mîn umtirna dingin ka thaw dân ding ka hriet tah,’ a ta."
"And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?","Chuongchun, a pu sum battuhai chu a ko seng a, a hmasatak kuoma chun, ‘Ka pu kuomah iengzât am i bat a?’ a ta."
"And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.","Ama chun, ‘Hriek tekhâwng za khat,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘I lekha la la, ṭhung vat la, sâwmnga ziek rawh,’ a ta."
"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.","Chun, mi dang kuomah, ‘Nang iengzât am i bat a?’ a ta. Ama chun, ‘Bu tekhâwng za khat,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘I lekha la la, sâwmriet ziek rawh,’ a ta."
And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.,"Chun, a pu chun, sum enkawltu fel naw chu a rem hriet leiin ân pâk tah a; var nauhai nêkin khawvêl nauhai hi an tulai dâna hin an var lem a nih."
"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.","“Ka hril cheu hi, sum tehlêmin in ta dingin ruolhai siem ro; sum a bohmang pha leh chatuona umnaa chun inumtira in umna dingin."
He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.,"Tukhawm tlâwmte chunga ringum chu tamtak chunga khawm ring a um hlak. Tukhawm, tlâwmte chunga ringum naw chu tamtak chunga khawm ring a um nawh."
"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?","Sum tehlêm chunga hman ring in um naw chun, tûin am sum tak chu inkawltir a ti cheu a?"
"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?","Mi dang ta chunga hman ring in lo um ta naw chun, nangni ta ding chu tûin am pêng an ti cheu a?"
"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","Siehlaw tukhawmin hotu pahni rawng a bâwl kawp thei nawh; pakhat chu theidain pakhat chu dit a tih, annawleh, pakhat ṭanin pakhat hmusit a tih. Pathien le sum rawng in bâwl kawp thei nawh,” a ta."
"And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.","Chun, Pharisai tangka ngaina- tuhai chun chuong thu chu an hriet a, an nuisan a."
"And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah, “Mi mithmua insukfel el in nih, nisienlakhawm, Pathienin in lungril a hriet sih a; mihriem laia an ichawimawi chu Pathien mithmua chun tirdakumtak a nih."
"The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.","Dân le zâwlneihai thu chu Johan hung um chen khan a um a; chu chena inthawk chun Pathien ram Chanchin Ṭha hi an hril a, mi tin an lût hrâm seng a,"
"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.","nisienlakhawm, Dân thu sun- hâng chîterek khawm a bo nêk chun vân le khawvêl bohmang a awl lem a nih."
"Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.","“Tûkhawm nuhmei maa, nuhmei dang nei taphawt chu a uire a nih; tûkhawm mi nuhmei mâk nei taphawt chu a uire a nih."
"Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:","“Chun, mi hausa tû amanih a um a, puon senduk le puon zai inhmitak a sil a, ni tin inhawitirtakin a um hlak a."
"and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,","Chun, a hming Lazar, kutdaw pakhat pânna ibâwm sip, a kawtkhâr bulah an inzâltir hlak a,"
"and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.",mi hausa dawkâna a fâk nawi tla chu fâk a nuom a; uihai hlak chun a pânna chu an liekpêk hlak a.
"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.","Chun, hieng ang hi a na, kutdaw chu a thi a, vântirkohaiin an fepui a, Abraham ângsûngah an sieh a. Mi hausa khawm chu a thi a, phûmin a um tah a."
"And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.","Chun, mithi khuoa chun natak tuorin a um a, a hang dâk a, hlataka Abraham, a ângsûnga Lazar um leh a hmu tah a."
"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.","Chun, a khêk a, ‘Pa Abraham, mi lunginsiet la, Lazar kha hung tir rawh, a kutpâr tuiah inchie sien- la; ka lei sukdeina dingin; hi meichawka hin ka na bêk bêk el,’ a ta."
"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish.","“Nisienlakhawm, Abrahamin, ‘Ka naupa, i dam lai khan thil ṭha i hmuh a, chuong ang bawkin Lazarin thil ṭha naw a hmu kha hre zing ta la; nisienlakhawm, ama chu tuhin hitaka hin thlamuongtakin a um a, nang chu i na a ni kha."
"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.","Hieng naw khawm hi, hitaka inthawka nangni kuoma fe tumhai chu an fe thei nawna dingin le, tu- khawm khataka inthawka keini kuom tieng an hung kai thei nawna dingin, keini le nangni inkâra hin hnuoi kak nasatak an siem tlat a nih,’ a ta."
"And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;","“Chun, ama chun, ‘Anleh, pa, ama chu ka pa ina bêk infetir dingin ka ngên che;"
"for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.","piengpui pasal panga ka nei sih a; hi na umnaa hin hung ve rawi an tih, ṭhahnemngaitakin hril raw se,’ a ta."
"But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.","Abraham ruok chun, ‘Mosie le zâwlneihai an nei annâwm; chuhai thu chu ngai raw hai se,’ a ta."
"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.","Chun, ama chun, ‘Pa Abraham, ni lo e, mithi laia mi meu an kuomah fe sienla, sim an tih,’ a ta."
"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Mosie le zâwlneihai thu an awi naw chun, mithi laia mi tho nâwk sienla khawm awi chuong naw ni hai,’ a tih a,” a ta."
"And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through whom they come!","Chun, Isûn a închûktirhai kuomah, “Tlûknahai um naw thei a ni nawh; nisienlakhawm, tlûkna inumtirtu chung chu a rik!"
"It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Hieng mi chînhai laia pakhat khawm sukthlûk nêk chun, a sukthlutu ding rînga chun bu râwt nawina lung inhlitirin, tuisuorietah thlâk ni sienla, a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih."
"Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.","“Fîmkhur ro, i unauin thil a suksuol chun kâwk rawh; ân sîr chun ngaidam rawh."
"And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.","Ni khatah vawi sari i chungah thil suksuolin, vawi sari, ‘Kân sîr,’ tia nanga tieng a ngha nâwk chun, i ngaidam ding a nih,” a ta."
"And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.","Chun, tîrkohai chun Lalpa kuomah, “Kan ringna sukphui deu raw khai,” an ta."
"And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.","Chun, Lalpa chun, “Anṭam mu mal khat ang ringna in nei chun, hi thingtheihmi kûng kuoma hin, ‘Hung inphawi la, tuisuorietah lo inphun rawh,’ tîng in ta, in thu awi el a tih."
"But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat;","“Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia tûkhawm hnuoi inletin amanih, berâm vêngin amanih, suok nei sienla, a lo fe hung pha, ‘Bu hung fa nghâl rawh,’ a lo ti ding am a nih?"
"and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?","‘Ka fâk ding mi siempêk la, puon dierkei la, ka fâk ka dâwn khawp hmakhat chun ka rawng bâwl rawh; chu hnunga chun nangin fain, dâwn i tih,’ a lo ti lem naw ding am a nih?"
Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded?,In thu anga a thaw leiin in suok kuomah lâwmthu in hril hlak am a nih?
"Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni khawmin in kuomah thupêk ang po poa in thaw zo phaleh, ‘Suok ṭhahnem naw kan nih ie; kan thaw ding hrim kan thaw a nih,’ ti ro,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.","Chun, Jerusalema an fe dingin, Samari le Galili ram chu a fe thleng a."
"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:","Chun, khaw ienga manih a lût dingin, mi inphâr ruok sâwmin an intuokpui a; chuonghai chu hlatakah an ngîr a,"
"and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.","chun, râwl inringtakin, “Isu inchûktirtu, mi lunginsiet rawh,” an ta."
"And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.","Chun, ama chun anni chu a hang hmu chun, “Thiempuhai kuomah vân entir ro,” a ta. Chun, an fe lai chun an hung inthieng tâwl tah a."
"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;","Chun, anni laia pakhat chun a dam tah ti ân hriet phingleh, râwl inringtaka Pathien inpâk pei pumin a kîr nâwk tah a;"
"and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.","chun, a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, a lâwmthu a hril a; chun, ama chu Samari mi a ni nghe ngheh a."
"And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?","Chuongchun, Isûn a dawn a, “Mi sâwm kha in hung inthieng tah a ni naw am a nih? Pakuohai kha khâwlai am an um a?"
"Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?","Pathien inpâk dinga kîr nâwk, hi hnam dang mi chau naw hi tukhawm hmuin an um naw a ni maw?” a ta."
"And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.","Chun, a kuomah, “Tho la, fe rawh, i ringna hi i dampui a ni hi,” a ta."
"And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:","Chun, Pharisaihaiin Pathien ram hung tlung ding hun an indawn leiin an kuomah, “Pathien ram chu hmu theiin a hung tlung nawh ie,"

"And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.","Chun, inchûktirhai kuoma chun, “Mihriem Naupa dam lai nihai ni khat bêk hi in hmu nuom nihai la um a tih; nisienlakhawm, hmu ta si naw ti niu."

"for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.","kâwlkawdawng khing tienga kâwl ân lep a, kâwlkawdawng khing tieng chenah a var hlak ang hin, Mihriem Naupa hi a hung ni chun a um ding a ni sih a."
But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.,"Nisienlakhawm, chu hma chun thil tamtak tuor a ta, hi ruoltharhai ditnawin um bawk a tih."
"And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.","“Noa dam laia thil umzie ang khan, Mihriem Naupa a hung nâwk nihai chun um bawk a tih."
"They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.","Noa lawngah a lût a, tui a hung lêt a, an rênga a sukhlum vawng ni kha a tlung hmakhat chun, an fâkin an dâwn a, nuhmei pasal an innei hlak."
"Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;","“Chuong ang bawkin Lota dam laiin a hung um a: an fâkin an dâwn a, an inchâwkin an zawr a, an chîngin an bâwl hlak a;"

after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.,Chuong ang bawk chun Mihriem Naupa hung inlâr ni chun um a tih.
"In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.","Chu ni chun tûkhawm a sum in sûnga uma, ama in chunga um chu, inchu dingin ṭum naw raw se; loa um chu hung bawk naw raw se."

"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.","Pharisai chu a ngîr a, ama khât chauin hieng ang hin a ṭawngṭai a, ‘Pathien, mi dang hlêpruhai, fel nawhai, uirehai ang ka ni naw lei le, hi siedâwltu ang khawm hi ka ni naw leiin i chungah ka lâwm ie."
I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.,"Châwlkâr khatah vawi hni bu ka nghei hlak a; ka nei taphawt sâwmah pakhat ka pêk hlak,’ a ta."
"But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinner.","Siedâwltu ruok chu hlatakah a ngîr a, vân tieng khawm a dâk ngam nawh a, ‘Pathien, kei mi suol hi mi lunginsiet rawh,’ tiin a âwm ân chum ân chum ta lem a."
"I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.","Ka hril cheu hi, a hmasa nêkin ama lem chu thiem changin a inah a fe thla ta lem a.

"And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.","Chun, a them dingin a kuomah an nautêhai an hung ṭhuoi a; inchûktirhai ruok chun chu chu an hmu phingleh an lo hal a."
"But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.","Nisienlakhawm, Isu chun a ko a, “Naupangtêhai ka kuomah inhung- tir unla, khap naw ro; Pathien ram chu hieng ang mihai ta a ni sih a."
"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm Pathien ram chu nau- pangtêin a lâwm anga lâwm naw phawt chu a sûngah lût naw tawp an tih,” a ta."
"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","Chun, hotu tûin amanih a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu ṭha, chatuona hringna ka nei theina dingin ieng am thâwng ka ta?” a ta."
"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, even God.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Ieng- dinga ṭha i mi ti? mi pakhat chau naw chu tûkhawm ṭha an um nawh, chu chu Pathien a nih."
"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.","Thupêkhai chu i hriet an- nâwm ‘Uire naw, tuol that naw, inru naw, hrietpuina inkhêl pe naw, i nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ tihai hi,” a ta."
"And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.","Chun, ama chun, “Chuong thu po po chu naupangte ka ni laia inthawkin ka zâwm pei hlak,” a ta."
"And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.","Chun, Isûn chu chu a hrietin a kuomah, “Tu khawm hin kawng khat i la bâk ie; i nei po po zawr la, pasiehai kuomah sem rawh, chuongchun, vânah ro nei i tih; chun, hung la, mi hung zui rawh,” a ta."
"But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.","Ama ruok chu chuong thu chu a hrietin a lungngai bêk bêk a, a hausak bêk leiin."
"And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","Chuongchun, Isûn ama chu a en a, “Sum hauhai chu Pathien rama lût a vân tak âwm deh aw!"
"For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","Mi hausa Pathien rama lût nêkin sanghâwngsei ṭhimnaah lût thleng a awl lem a nih,” a ta."
"And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved?","Chun, chu thu hrehai chun, “Anleh, tu am sandam ni thei a ta?” an ta."
"But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.","Ama ruok chun, “Mihriem thaw ruollo hi Pathien thaw thei a nih,” a ta."
"And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.","Chun, Peterin, “Ngai ta, keinîn kan in le lo mâksanin kan zui cheh a!” a ta."
"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm Pathien ram leia in amanih, nuhmei amanih, unauhai amanih, nu le pa amanih, nauhai amanih mâksan taphawt chu,"
"who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.","hi dam sûng ngei khawm hin a nêka tam lem hmu naw ding tûkhawm an um nawh, hun la hung tlung dinga chatuona hringna leh,” a ta."
"And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man.","Chun, sâwm le pahnihai chu a kuomah a tumin a ṭhuoi a, an kuomah, “ngai ta u, Jerusalemah ei hang fe ding a ni hi; zâwlneihai thu ziek po po kha Mihriem Naupa chunga hin tlung a tih."
"For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon:","Jentailhai kuomah pêng an ta, nuiza siemna dingin hmang an tih, inzakumtakin siem an ta, chil sâkkhum an ta,"
and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.,"chun, vuong an ta, sukhlum an tih; chun, ni thum niin tho nâwk a tih,” a ta."
"And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.","Chun, chuong thu hrim hrim chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a; thu hril chu anni ta dingin thupin a um a, ieng hril am a ni khawm an hriet nawh."
"And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:","Chun, Jeriko a tlung tâwmin mitdel tu amanih lampui sîrah kut dawin a lo ṭhung a;"
"and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.","ama chun mipui fe ri chu a hriet a, iengtizie am a ni taa ti ân dawn a."
"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.","Chun, anni chun Nazareth Isu a fe a nih ti an hril a."
"And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Chuongchun, ama chu, “Isu David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk a."
"And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Chun, a hmasahai chun to dingin an hal a; nisienlakhawm, ama chu, “David Naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk zuol det a."
"And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,","Chuongchun, Isu a ngir a, a kuoma hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a;"
"What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.","chun, a kâwl a hung tlung chun, “I chungah ieng ang am ka thaw i nuom a?” a ta, a lo indawn a. Chun, ama chun, “Lalpa, hmu thei ka nuom,” a ta."
"And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Hmu thei ta raw khai, i ringna hi i dampui a nih,” a ta."
"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.","Chun, kârloin a hmu thei nghâl tah a, Pathien inpâk pum peiin ama chu a zui tah a; chun, mi po po chun, chu chu an hmu chun Pathien an inpâk a."
And he entered and was passing through Jericho.,"Chun, Isu Jeriko khuoah a lût a, a fethleng ding a na."
"And behold, a man called by name Zacchæus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat a hming Zakai a um a; ama chu siedâwl hotu a na, a hausa hleh a."
"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.","Chun, Isu chu mi ieng ang am a ni hmu a tum a; mipui leiin a hmu thei nawh a, ama hlak ân hnuoi sih a."
"And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.","Chuongchun, a tlân khal a, a en dingin theichang lêrah a lâwn a; chu lampui chu a hung hraw ding a ni leiin."
"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchæus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.","Chun, Isu chu chu hmun a tlung chun a tang a, a kuomah, “Zakai, hung ṭum vak rawh; vawisûn i inah ka tlung ding a nih,” a ta."
"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.","Chun, inhmawtakin a ṭum a, hlimtakin ama chu ân tlungtir tah a."
"And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.","Chun, chu chu an hmu phingleh an rêngin, “Mi suol kuoma tlung dingin a lût ta saw,” an tih a, an chier a."
"And Zacchæus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.","Chun, Zakai chu a ngir a, Lalpa kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, Lalpa, ka sum zâtve pasiehai kuomah pêng ka ta; chun, tu chunga khawm thil ieng khawm lo hlêpru ka ni chun a lêt liin thung nâwk ka tih,” a ta."
"And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.","Chun, Isûn Zakai chungthu a hril a, “Vawisûn hi ina hin sandamna a hung tlung tah, ama khawm Abraham naupa a ni sih a."
For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.,"Bohmanghai zawnga sandam dingin Mihriem Naupa hi a hung a ni hrim a nih,” a ta."
"And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.","Chun, chuong thuhai chu an ngâi laiin, Jerusalem a hnai ta leiin le Pathien ram hung inlang nghâl ding nia an ring leiin tekhithu a hril sah a."
"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.","Chuongchun, hieng thu hi a hril a, “Mi ṭha tû amanih ram awpna thu laa hung kîr nâwk dingin ram hlatakah a feh a."
"And he called ten servants of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye herewith till I come.","A fe dingin a suokhai sâwm a ko a, an kuomah rângkachak tangka sâwm a pêk a, an kuomah, ‘Ka hung tlung nâwk hmakhat chu hi hin lo sumdâwng ro,’ a ta."
"But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us.","Nisienlakhawm, a khuohaiin an theidah a, ‘Hi mipa hi kan lal dingin kan dit nawh,’ ti dingin a hnungah palai an intlântir veh a."
"And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.","“Chun, ram awpna thu chu a lâka a hung kir nâwk chun, a suok tangka a ipêkhai chu, an sukpung dân inhrietna dingin ân kotir a."
"And the first came before him, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more.","Chun, a hmasatak chu a hung a, ‘Pu, i rângkachak tangka kha sâwmin a pung,’ a ta."
"And he said unto him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.","Ama chun a kuomah, ‘Suok ṭha, i thaw ṭha ie, tlâwmtê chungah ring i um leiin khaw sâwm chungah hotuin um rawh,’ a ta."
"And the second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds.","Chun, a dawttu chu a hung a, ‘Pu, i rângkachak tangkas kha pangain a pung ie,’ a ta."
"And he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities.","Chun, ama chun ama kuoma khawm chun, ‘Nang khawm khaw panga chungah hotuin um rawh,’ a ta."
"And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin:","“Chun, mi dang a hung a, ‘Pu, en ta, hi i rângkachak tangka kha! thlanhrûkna puonin ka fûn zing;"
"for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that which thou didst not sow.","mi vîntak i ni leiin ka ṭi che a nih; i sie naw khawm i lâk hlak a, i tu naw khawm i sîk hlak sih a,’ a ta."
"He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;","“Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Suok suol, i ṭawngbau suok ngeiin kân thiem naw che. Mi vîntak ka na, ka sie naw khawm ka lâk a, ka tu naw khawm ka sîk hlak ti i hriet maw?"
"then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?","A ni sa chun, ka tangka hi iengdinga sumdâwng ina i sie naw am a na? Chuongchun, ka hung hin a pung leh ka hung ṭhîn ding bah,’ a ta."
"And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.","Chun, a kâwla ngirhai kuomah, ‘A rângkachak tangka kha lâkpêk unla, rângkachak tangka sâwm neitu kuomah pe ro,’ a ta."
"And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, ‘Pu, ama chun rângkachak tangka sâwm a nei annawm’ an ta."
"I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.","‘Ka ti cheu hi, a nei taphawt chu pe belsâng an ta, a nei naw chu a nei sun khawm chu lâkpêk an tih."
"But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.","Nisienlakhawm, hieng a mi dotuhai an lal dinga mi dit nawhai hi hung ṭhuoi unla, ka hmaah that ro,’ a tih a,” a ta."
"And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.","Chun, chuong ang thu a hril zo chun Jerusalem panin a hmasah a."
"And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,","Bethphage le Bethani khaw kâwl, Oliv tlâng an ti chu a tlung chun, inchûktirhai laia mi pahni a tir a,"
"saying, Go your way into the village over against you; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.","“In hma zâwn khuoa sawn va fe unla, chuongchun, in lût hlimin sabengtungtê thlung tukhawm la chuongna ngai naw va hmûng in tih; chu chu sût unla, hung kei ro."
"And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.","Chun, tûkhawmin, ‘Iengdinga in sût am?’ tia an indawn cheu chun, ‘Lalpain a mamaw a nih,’ tiin hril ro,” a ta."
"And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.","Chun, a tirhai chu an fe tah a, an kuoma a hril ang ngeiin an va hmuh a."
"And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?","Chun, sabengtungtê chu an sût lai chun, a neituhaiin an kuomah, “Sabengtungtê kha iengdinga in sût am?” an ta."
"And they said, The Lord hath need of him.","Chun, anni chun, “Lalpain a mamaw a nih,” an tih a."
"And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.","Chuongchun, Isu kuomah an hung kei a; chun, sabengtungtê chunga chun an puonhai an phah a, a chungah Isu an inchuongtir a."
"And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.","Chun, a fena ding lampuia chun an puonhai an pha pei a."
"And as he was now drawing nigh, even at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;","Chun, a tlung ding tâwmin, Oliv tlâng liem tâwmin inchûktir mipui po po chun a thilmak thawhai po po an hmu leiin an lâwm a, râwl inringtakin Pathien an inpâk a,"
"saying, Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.","“Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se; vânah inremna inlêng sienla, achunghnungtaka khin ropuina um raw se,” tiin."
"And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.","Chun, mipui laia Pharisai ṭhenkhatin a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i închûktirhai hi kâwk rawh,” an ta."
"And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.","Ama ruok chun, “Ka hril cheu hi, hienghai hi an to zing chun, lunghai bêk an khêk suok ding a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,","Chun, a tlung ding ṭepin, khuo chu a hmuh a, a ṭap nghah a,"
"saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.","“Aw, nang hin tuta sûng hin thlamuongna ding thu hi lo hre hrâm la chu aw! Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu i hmu thei nawna dingin ân thup ta sih a."
"For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,","Hieng ang nihai hi i chungah a la tlung ding a ni sih a; i râlhaiin i vêlin hnuoi kul siem an ta, inhuol an ti cheh a;"
"and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.","i sûngah i nauhai le nang leh hnuoiah pei rak an ti che; i sûngah lung inthuo hrim hrim hla naw ni hai, an fang lai che i hriet naw leiin,” tiin."
"And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,","Chun, Pathien biekina chun a va lût a, iengkhat zawrtuhai chu a hnawt dawk tah a;"
"saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.","an kuomah, “ ‘Ka in chu ṭawng- ṭaina in nîng a tih,’ ti ziek a nih; nangni ruok chun suomhmanghai pûkah in siem lem hi,” a ta."
And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:,"Chun, ni tin Pathien biekina chun ân chûktir hlak a. Chun, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai leh, vântlâng laia hotu deuhaiin, ama sukbohmang an tum a;"
"and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.","nisienlakhawm, mihaiin ṭha- hnemngaitaka thu an ngai leiin, a thaw ngaina an hriet si nawh."
"Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.","Chun, Kaisar Augustain khawvêl ram po po hming ziek ding thu a pêk a."
This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.,Chu chu Suria rama Kurini Bawrsâp a ni laia hming ziek hmasa tak chu a nih.
"And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city.","Chuongchun, mi po po chu an hming ziek dingin anni khuo sengah an feh a."
"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;","Josef khawm, David sûnghai le a thla a ni leiin, Galili rama Nazareth khuoa inthawka Judai rama David khuo Bethlehem an tia chun a feh a,"
"to enrol himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child.","a nuhmei huol Mari, naupai inhlâtak pum le chun an hming ziek dingin."
"And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.","Chun, chutaka an um lai chun a naunei chu a hung hun tah a."
"And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.","Chun, a nau lutîrah naupasal a nei a; puonin a tuom a, khuolbûkah an inleng ve naw leiin ran bu pêkna thlêngah ân zâltir a."
"And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.","Chun, chu rama ma chun berâm vêngtuhai an um a, zânah an berâm- hai an vêng a, phûlah an rieknghah a."
"And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.","Chun, Lalpa vântirko pakhat an kâwlah a hung ngîr a, Lalpa ropuinân an vêl chu a hung sun var a; chuongchun, an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
"And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people:","Chun, vântirko chun an kuomah, “Ṭi naw unla, ngai ro, mi tin ta ding chanchin ṭha lâwmum bêk bêk ka hung intlun cheu a nih."
"for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.","Vawisûn hin in ta dingin David khuoah Sandamtu a pieng tah, Lal Krista chu."
"And this is the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.","Chun, hi hi in ta dingin inchik- na ding a nih; naute puona tuom, ran bu pêkna thlênga zâl hmûng in tih,” a ta."
"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,","Chun, kârloin vântirko kuoma chun vâna mihai mipui an hung um ta huk el a, Pathien an inpâk a,"
"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.","“A chunghnungtakah Pathien ropuitakin um raw se, Hnuoi chunga a ilâwm bêk bêk mihriemhai kuomah inremna thu inlêng raw se,” an tih a."
"And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.","Chun, vântirkohai chun vân tieng an fe san phingleh, berâm vêngtuhai chun, “Tuhin Bethlehem chenin fe inla, Lalpain thu a mi hril hung tlung chu en ei tiu,” an in tih a."
"And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.","Chuongchun, an fe vat vat a, Mari le Josef leh, ran bu pêkna thlênga nautê zâl le chun an hmuh a."
"And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.","Chun, an hmu chun nautê chanchin thu vântirkoin a hril kha an hril vêl a."
And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds.,"Chun, a hre taphawt chun berâm vêngtuhai thu hril chu mak an ti hleh a."
"But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.","Mari ruok chun thu hril po po chu a lungrilin a ngaituoh a, a vawng zing a."
"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.","Chun, berâm vêngtuhai chun vântirko hril ang ngeia iengkim an hmua an hriet leiin, Pathien chawimawi le inpâk pei pumin an kîr nâwk tah a."
"And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.","Chun, a sertanna ding ni riet a hung tling chun, a hminga chun sula a um hma daia vântirkoin a sak tasa ISU an sak a."
"And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord","Chun, Mosie dân anga an inthien ni a hung tlung chun ama chu Jerusalemah an hung ṭhuoi a,"
"(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),","Lalpa Dân thua, “Nau lutîr pasal taphawt chu Lalpa ta dinga ruot tîng an tih” ti ziek ang khan,"
"and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.","Lalpa kuoma inhlân ding le vaṭhu tuok khat amanih, pârva tê pahni amanih Lalpa Dân thua ziek anga that dingin."
"And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.","Chun, ngai ta, Jerusalema chun mi pakhat a hming Simeon a um a; ama chu mi feltak le Pathien ngaisaktak a na; Israel thlamuongtu ding chu a nghâk zing a, a chungah Thlarau Inthieng a um a."
"And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.","Chun, Lalpa Krista chu a hmu hmakhat chu thi naw ni ti Thlarau Inthiengin a lo inhriettir ta hrim a."
"And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,","Chun, Thlarau inhriettirin Pathien biekina chun a va lût a; nautê Isu chu a nu le a pain Dân pângngai anga a chunga thawpêk dinga an hung ṭhuoi lût lai chun,"
"then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,","ama chun a lo pawm a, Pathien ân pâk a;"
"Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord, According to thy word, in peace;","“Lalpa, tuhin i thu ang peiin i suok hi thlamuongtakin în fetir ding a na;"
"For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,","I sandamna chu ka mitin a hmu tah a,"
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;,Mi tin mithmua I siem kha;

"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,","Chun, mi pakhat zâwlnei Anna, Phanuel naunu, Aser hnama mi a um a.

"And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.","Chun, nautê chu a hung inṭhang lien deu deu a, a hung hrât deu deu a, varnain a sip tah a, Pathien lunginsietna a chungah a um bawk a."
And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.,"Chun, kum tinin Fekân Ruoiṭhe hunin a nu le pa chu Jerusalemah an fe hlak a."
"And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;",Ama chu kum sâwmpahni a niin ruoiṭhe dân pângngaiin an hang feh a.
"and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;","An ṭumṭieka an hung chun, naupang Isu chun Jerusalemah a um san tah a; a nu le pa chun an hriet si nawh a."

"and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.","Chun, an hmu naw leiin zawng pei pumin Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a."
"And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:","Chun, ni thum chena chun, Pathien biekinah, inchûktirtuhai laia ṭhungin, an thu lo ngai a, lo indawnin an hmu tah a."
and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.,"Chun, a thu hre taphawt chun a hrietzie le a dawnzie chu mak an ti hleh a."
"And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.","Chun, a nu le pa chun ama an hmu chun mak an ti hleh a, chuongchun, a nu chun a kuomah, “Ka nau, iengdinga hienga i mi thaw?

And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.,"Chun, an kuoma a thu hril chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a."
"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.","Chun, anni chu a zui thlâk a, Nazareth chu a hung tlung a, an thu zâwmin a um a. Chun, a nu chun chuong thil po po chu a lungrilah a vawng zing a."
"And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.","Chun, Isu chu a var deu deu a, a hung lien deu deu a, Pathien le mihriem ditsakin a um deu deu a."
"And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders;","Chun, ni khat chu, Pathien biekina mihai ân chûktir a, Chanchin Ṭha a hril laiin, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chu, upahai leh a kuomah an hung thut a;"

"But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.","Chun, ‘Mihriem thu,’ ei ti chun, mi po poin lungin mi dêng an tih; Johan chu zâwlnei a ni an ring sih a,” an ta."
"And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.","Chuongchun, an dawn a, “Khâw- tieng lem thu am a ni kan hriet nawh,” an ta."
"And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei khawmin, tû thuin am hieng thil hi ka thaw a, hril bîk naw ning cheu,” a ta."
"And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time.","Chun, vântlâng kuomah hi tekhithu hi a hril tah a; “Tûin amanih grêp huon a siem a, lo enkawltuhai kuomah thlohlaw dingin a pêk a, sâwttak thang dingin ram dangah a fe tah a."
"And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.","A lo hun chun huona ra chu a chanâi an lo pêk dingin lo enkawl- tuhai kuoma chun suok pakhat a tir a; nisienlakhawm, lo enkawltuhai chun an lo vuok a, kutruokin an infetir nâwk tah a."
"And he sent yet another servant: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty.","Chun, suok dang a tir nâwk a; chu khawm chu an vuok nâwk bawk a, inzakumtakin an siem a, kutruok bawkin an infetir nâwk tah a."
"And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth.","Chun, a pathumna a tir nâwk a; chu khawm chu an lo suksil a, an pei suok tah a."
"And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.","“Chun, grêp huon neitupa chun, ‘Iengtin am thâwng ka ta? Ka naupa dittak tir el ka tih; ama hi an lo inza duoiin,’ a ta."
"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.","Nisienlakhawm, lo enkawltuhai chun ama chu an hmu phingleh, ‘Ama hi rohluotu ding chu a nih, that ei tiu; chuongchun, a ro chu ei ta nîng a tih,’ tiin an inrâwn a."
"And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?","Chuongchun, grêp huona in- thawk chu an the suok a, an sukhlum tah a. Grêp huon neitupa chun an chungah iengtin am hung thâwng a ta?"
"He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.","Lo enkawltuhai chu hung sukbohmang a ta, huon chu mi danghai pêng a tih,” a ta. Chun, chu chu an hrietin, “Chuong êm chu tlung naw raw se!” an ta."
"But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner?","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun anni chu a en a, “Hi thu an ziek hi ieng am a na? ‘In bâwltuhai lung dit naw kha, Chu ngei chu a kia lung ṭhangkai tak a lo ni tah,’ ti hi."

And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.,"Chun, chuong lai tak chun Dân inchûktirtuhai le thiempu lalhaiin man an tum a; nisienlakhawm, mipui chu an ṭih a; chu tekhithu chu anni demin a hril ti an hriet sih a."
"And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.","Chun, ama chu Bawrsâp rorêlna le thuneinaa pêk dingin, a thu hril suol la dingin an inchân zing a, enthlittu, mi ṭha anga inlang tehlêmhai chu an tir a."
"And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person of any, but of a truth teachest the way of God:","Anni chun a kuomah, “Inchûk- tirtu, indiktakin thu i hrilin în chûktir a, tûkhawm thlier bîk loin, thaw taktakin Pathien kawng thu în chûktir hlak ti kan hriet a;"

"But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an dâwp a nih ti a hriet a, an kuomah,"
"Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Cæsar’s.","“Duli mîn entir ro,” a ta. “Tû lim le tu hming am a na a chuong hi?” a ta. Anni chun, “Kaisar,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Then render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Kaisar thilhai chu Kaisar kuomah pe unla, Pathien thilhai chu Pathien kuomah pe ta unla,” a ta."
"And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.","Chuongchun, mipui hmaah a thu hril suol lâk ding an hmu nawh a; a dawnna chu mak an ti hleh a, an to zing a."
"And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection;","Chun, Saddukai, thonâwkna a um nawh tihai laia mi tuhai amanih a kuomah an hung a, a kuomah,"
"and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.","“Inchûktirtu, Mosien, tûkhawm a unaupain nuhmei nei sienla, nau nei loin thi sienla, a unaupa chun a nuhmei chu hluoin, a unaupa ta dingin chi a thlapêk ding a nih ti a mi ziekpêk a nih."
"There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;","Âwle, sal sari an um a; a upatakin nuhmei a nei a, nau nei loin a thi tah a."
and the second:,A pahnina chun a hluoh a; nau nei lo bawkin a thi tah a;
"and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.",a pathumna chun a hluo nâwk a; chuong ang sengin pasarihai chu nau nei loin an thi pei a.
Afterward the woman also died.,Chu hnunga chun nuhmei khawm chu a thi tah a.
In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.,"Chuongchun, thonâwk pha chun a tû nuhmei tak am nîng a ta? an pasari chun nuhmeiin an nei seng sih a,” tiin an indawn a."
"And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tulai mihai hi nuhmei pasal an innei hlak;"
"but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:","nisienlakhawm, chuong phaa ṭhang tlâk le mithi laia inthawka thonâwknaa ṭhang tlâka ruot taphawthai chu, nuhmei pasal innei ta naw ni hai,"
"for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.","thi khawm thi nâwk thei ta naw ni hai, vântirkohai tlukin an um ding a ni sih a; thonâwkna nauhai an ni leiin Pathien nauhai nîng an tih."
"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.","Mithi keithoin an um ding a nih ti Mosie khawmin Chîmbuk thuah Lalpa chu, ‘Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien,’ a ti lai khan ân hriettir kha."
"Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.","Ama chu mithi Pathien a ni nawh a, mi hring Pathien a ni lem ie; amaa chun mi po po an hring vawng sih a,” a ta."
"And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.","Dân inchûktirtu tuhaiin ama- nih, “Inchûktirtu, i hril indik ngawt el!” an ta, an dawn a."
For they durst not any more ask him any question.,Thu dang an indawn ngam ta si nawh a.
"And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Krista chu David naupa a nih ti iengtiziea ti hlak am an na?"
"For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,","Inpâkna Hla buah David ngeiin, ‘Lalpa chun ka Lalpa kuomah, Ka changtieng ṭhung rawh,"

"And he looked up, and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury.","Chun, a dâk suok a, mi hausahaiin thawlâwm bâwma an thawlâwm thlâk lai a hmuh a."
And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.,"Chun, hmeithai pasetak tûin amanih dâr tangka dere pahni a hung thlâk a hmu bawk a."
"And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all:","Chuongchun, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hienghai po po nêkin hi hmeithai pasetak hin a thlâk tam lem;"
for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had.,"hieng po po hin an nei liema chu thawlâwmah an thlâk a nih; ama ruok hin chu a dit laitak, a khawsakpui dinga a nei sun chu a thlâk vawng a nih,” a ta."
"And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said,","Chun, tuhaiin amanih Pathien biekin thu, lung ṭhatak le thilpêka an icheimawizie chu an hril laiin, ama chun,"
"As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.","“Hieng in thil hmu hi, sukchim loa lung inthuo hrim hrim hitaka hin um naw ni; chuong ang ni chu la tlung a tih,” a ta."
"And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when these things are about to come to pass?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, chuong chu ieng tik am hung um a ti leh? Chuong chu a hung tlung ding pha inchikna ieng am um a ta?” tiin an indawn a."
"And he said, Take heed that ye be not led astray: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am he; and, The time is at hand: go ye not after them.","Chun, ama chun, “An hlêm nawna ding cheuin fîmkhur ro.

"And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to pass first; but the end is not immediately.","Chun, indo thu le buoi thu in hriet pha ṭi naw ro; chuong chu a tlung hmasa ding hrim a nih, tâwpna ruok chu tlung nghâl el hri naw ni,” a ta."

And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.,"Chuongchun, ama chun pindan chunghnung lientak, thuomhnaw umsa inentir a ti cheu a; chutaka chun buotsai ro,” a ta."
"And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.","Chun, an fe tah a, an kuoma a hril ang takin an hmuh a; chun, Fekân Ruoi chu an buotsai tah a."
"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.","Chun, a fâk a hung hun chun, ama chun thlêng a awt a, a tirkohai chun an awtpui veh a."
"And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:","Chun, an kuomah, “Ka thil tuor hma hin hi Fekân Ruoi hi fâkpui cheu ka nuom bêk bêk a nih."
"for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.","Ka hril cheu hi, hi hi Pathien rama sukfamkim a ni hmakhat chu ka fâk nâwk ta naw ding a nih,” a ta."
"And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:","Chun, no a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin, “Hi hi la unla, insem ro,"
"for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.","ka hril cheu hi, tuta inthawk Pathien ram a hung tlung hmakhat chu grêp hrui raa hi ka dâwn nâwk ta naw ding a nih,” a ta."
"And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.","Chun, bei a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin, a khawi a, an kuomah a pêk a, “Hi hi ka taksa [in aia pêk chu a nih; in mi hriet zingna dingin hi hi thaw hlak ro,” a ta."

"But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.","“Nisienlakhawm, ngai ta u, a mîn mantirtu ding kut chu ka kuom- ah dawkân chungah a um zing a nih."
"For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed!","Mihriem Naupa hi ruot ang ngeiin a fe ding a nih; nisienla- khawm, ân mantirtu ding mihriem chung chu a rik ie!” a ta."
"And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.","Chun, annin, “Eini laia thil chuong ang thaw ding chu tû am nîng ei ta le?” an ta, anni le anni an indawn a."
"And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.","Chun, anni laia tû tak am ropui taka ngai ding ti thuah insêlna a suok a."
"And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Jentailhai lalhai chu an chungah an inlal hlak a; an chunga thuneituhai chu, ‘Thilṭha thawtu’ tia ko an ni hlak."
"But ye shall not be so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni chu chuong ang chu ni naw ti niu; in laia ropui tak chu a chîn lem angin um sienla, ân lal tak chu rawngbâwltu angin um lem raw se."
"For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.","Tû am a ropui lem a? Bu fatu am, rawngbâwltu? Bu fatu chu a ni naw am a nih? Nisienlakhawm, kei chu nangni laia rawngbâwltu angin ka um hi."

"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.","Chun, a hmun chu a va tlung chun an kuomah, “Thlêmnaa in lût nawna dingin ṭawngṭai ro,” a ta."
"And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,","Chun, lung dêng phâk chenah a tumin a va feh a; chun, a dingṭha- ṭhuon a, a ṭawngṭai a,"
"saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.","“Pa, rem i ti chun, hi no hi ka kuoma inthawkin la hmang rawh; nisienlakhawm, keia thu ni loin, nangma thu thu ni lem raw se,” a ta."
"And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.","[Chun, vâna inthawkin vântir- ko pakhat a sukhar dingin a hung inlâr a."
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.,"Chun, a lung ân rim bêk bêk leiin ṭhahnemngai nâwk zuolin a ṭawngṭai a, a thlan chu thi far lientak angin, hnuoiah a zuk far a.]"

"While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.","Chun, a la hril zing laiin, ngai ta, mipui an hung a, sâwm le pahni laia ṭhang Juda an iti khan an hma a hung ṭhuoi a; chun, fâwp tumin Isu a hung pan a."

"And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?","Chun, a vêla mihai chun thil hung tlung ding chu an hrietin, “Lalpa kâwlhnâmin sât kan ti?” an ta."
"And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.","Chun, anni laia tûin amanih Thiempu Laltak suok chu a sât a, a nakâwr chang tieng a sât thlâkpêk a."
"But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.","Chun, Isûn a biek a, “Hi po hi ni raw se,” a ta, a nakâwr chu a them a, a sukdam tah a."
"And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?","Chun, Isûn a kuoma hung thiempu lalhai, Pathien biekin hotu- hai le, upahai kuoma chun, “Kâwl- hnâmhai, hembâwkhai chawiin, suomhmang man ding ang elin in hung a ni maw?"
"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.","Pathien biekina in kuoma ni tin ka um laihai khan mi man tumin in mi ban si nawh a; nisienlakhawm, tuhi nangni hun a nih, inthim thuneina leh,” a ta."
"And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.","Chun, an man a, an ṭhuoi a, Thiempu Laltak ina chun an ṭhuoi lût tah a."
"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.","Chun, Peterin hlataka inthawk- in a zui a. Chun, in inhuon sûng tuollai chun mei an sêm a, an ṭhung khâwm a, Peter chu anni lai a va ṭhung veh a."

"But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.","Ama ruok chun, “Nuhmei, ama chu ka hriet nawh,” tiin ân phat a."
"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.","Chun, anakie deu chun mi dangin a hung hmu nâwk a, “Nang khawm anni laia mi i ni hi,” a ta. Peter ruok chun, “Mihriem, ka ni nawh ie,” a ta."
"And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilæan.","Chun, dâr kâr khat lai hnunga chun, mi dangin, “Hi mipa khawm hi a kuoma um kha a ni ngei el; Galili ram mi a nih annâwm,” a ti tlat a."
"But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.","Chun, Peterin, “Mihriem, i thu hril chu ka hriet nawh,” a ta. Chun, kârloin, a ṭawng laitak chun âr a khuong nghâl tah a."
"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.","Chun, Lalpa chu a nghah a, Peter chu a en a. Peter chun Lalpain, “Vawisûn hin âr a khuong hmain vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a kuoma a ti thu kha a hung hriet dawk nâwk tah a."
"And he went out, and wept bitterly.","Chun, a suok a, a ṭap ta ngawi ngawi a."
"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and beat him.","Chun, Isu cheltuhai chun nuiza siemnân an hmang a, an vuok a."
"And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?","Chun, a mit an tuom a, “Hril rawh, tûin am a vuok cheh a?” tiin an indawn hlak a."
"And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.",Thu dang tamtak khawmin an hrilsietin an hal a.
"And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,","Chun, khawvar phingleh, vântlâng upahai, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chu an inrâwn khâwm a, an rorêlnaa chun an ṭhuoi a;"

"And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.","Chun, anni chun, “Ieng hrietna dang am ngai tâng ei ta? Eini ngeiin ama bau suok ei hriet tah annâwm,” an ta."
"And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.","Chun, a pung khâwmhai po po chu an tho a, Isu chu Pilat kuomah an ṭhuoi tah a."
"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.","Chun, “Hi mipa hin kan chihai a sukkhawhlo a, Kaisar kuomah sie chawi a khap bawk a, Krista, lal ân ti khawm kan hriet,” tiin an hêk a."
"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.","Chun, Pilatin a kuomah, “Judahai lal i ni maw?” tiin ân dawn a. Ama chun a kuomah, “I hril angin ka nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.","Chun, Pilatin thiempu lalhai le mipuihai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa chunga hin iengkhawm suol ka hmu nawh ie,” a ta."
"But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judæa, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun, “Galili ramah a phut a, hi hmun chen hin, Judai ram khaw tina inchûk- tirin, mi po po a chawk- buoi hlak a nih,” tîn an thaw nâwk zuol a."
"But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan.","Chun, Pilatin chu chu a hrietin, ama chu Galili rama mi a ni le ni naw ân dawn a."
"And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.","Chun, Herod biela mi a nih ti a hriet phingleh, Herod kuomah a tir tah a; chuong lai chun ama khawm Jerusalemah a um bawk a."
"Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.","Chun, Herodin Isu a hmu chun a lâwm bêk bêk a; a chanchin a hriet leiin inhmaa inthawkin hmu a nuom a."
And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.,"Chun, thu tamtak ân dawn a, iengkhawmin a dawn si nawh a."
"And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun ngîrin nasatakin an hêk an hêk a."
"And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.","Chun, Herod le a sipaihai chun Isu an suknawmna a, an nuisaw a; chun, puon ropuitak insiltirin Pilat kuomah a tir nâwk tah a."
And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.,Chu ni tak chun Herod le Pilat chu an inngei tah a; chu hma po chu an intai hlak a.
"And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,","Chun, Pilatin thiempu lalhai, hotuhai, mi po pohai a ko khâwm a,"
"and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:","an kuomah, “ ‘Mihai a suk- khawhlo,’ tiin hi mipa hi ka kuomah in hung ṭhuoi kha a na; chun, ngai ro, in hma ngeiah ka suosal a, in hêkna thua khan hi mipa chunga hin iengkhawm suol ka hmu naw a nih;"
"no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.","Herod khawmin a hmu bawk nawh; ei kuomah a hung tir nâwk el a ni hi; ngai ro, thina khawp meuin iengkhawm a thaw nawh ie."
"I will therefore chastise him, and release him.","Vuong ka ta, kân suo nâwk el ding a nih,” a ta."

"But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:—","Nisienlakhawm, inruoltakin an khêk a, “Hi mipa hi chu sukbohmang la, Barabba kha mîn suopêk lem rawh,” an ta."
"one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.",(Chu mipa chu khawpuia helna ieng amanih lei le tuol a that leiin intângna ina intâng a nih).
"And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;","Pilat ruok chun Isu insuoktir a nuom a, an kuomah thu a hril nâwk a;"
"but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.","nisienlakhawm, an khêk a, “Krawsah hemde rawh, krawsah hemde rawh,” an ta."
"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.","Chun, ama chun a vawi thumnaah an kuomah, “Ieng dingin am ie? Hi mipa hin ieng am a suksuol a?

"But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.","Anni ruok chun inringtakin krawsa hemde dingin an ngên ṭal a. Chun, an râwl chun a vau dei tah a."
And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.,"Chun, Pilat chun an ngên anga thaw dingin thu a sukthlûk tah a."
"And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.","Helna le tuolthat leia intângna ina intâng an ihni kha ân suoh a, Isu ruok chu an nuom nuoma an thaw dingin a pêk tah a."
"And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.","Chun, an ṭhuoi hmang laiin Simon, Kurinia mi, rama inthawka hung an man a. Isu hnung tienga put dingin a chungah kraws chu an innghat a."
"And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.","Chun, mipui le nuhmei âwm inchum inchuma ṭap ṭaphai, mipui nasatakin an zui a."
"But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.","Isu ruok chun anni tieng a ngha a, “Jerusalem naunuhai, mi ṭa naw ro, nangni le in nauhai ta dingin ṭap lem ro."
"For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.","Ngai ta u, a ni la hung tlung a tih, chuong nia chun, ‘Nuhmei chinghai, nau vawn ngai nawna phînghai, nau nêk ngai naw nênehai chu an hamṭha ie,’ la tîng an tih."
"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.","Chu pha chun mihaiin tlâng kâwla dâm, ‘Mi del rawh,’ la tîng an ta; muol kâwla dâm, ‘Mîn khum rawh,’ la tîng an tih."
"For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?","Thing hringa hman hieng ang an thaw chun, a ṭâwla chun iengtin takin am an thaw ding chu?” a ta."
"And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.","Chun, a kuomah mi dang pahni, mi suol, sukhlum dingin an ṭhuoi veh a."
"And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.","Chun, “Luru” an ti hmun chu an tlungin, chutaka chun krawsah an hemdeh a, mi suolhai leh, a chang- tieng pakhat, a vawitieng pakhat."
"And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.","Chun, Isûn, “Pa, anni hi ngaidam rawh, an thilthaw hi an hriet naw a ni hi,” a ta. Chun, a silfênhai chu an insemin ai an sân a."
"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.","Chun, mipuihai chun ngîrin an thlîr a. Chun, hotuhai khawmin, “Mi dang hman a sukdam hlak annâwm; Pathien ithlang Krista a ni zet chun ama le ama insukdam ta sienla,” tiin an ti-el a."
"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,","Chun, sipaihai khawmin ama chu an nuisaw a, a kuomah an hung a, zu thûr an pêk a,"
"and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.","“Judahai lal i ni tak zet chun insukdam rawh,” an ta."
"And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Chun, a chung tienga chun, “HI MIPA HI JUDAHAI LAL A NIH” ti lekha ziek a um a."
"And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.","Chun, an mi suol khai pakhat chun Isu a hal a, “Krista chu i ni naw am a nih? Insukdam la, keini khawm mi sukdam ta la,” a ta."

And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.,"Eini chu ei tuor âwm tak hrim tuor ei nih, ei thilthaw ra indiktak hmu ei ni chau lem a; ama ruok hin chu iengkhawm a suksuol si nawh,” a ta."
"And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.","Chun, “Isu, i ramah lala i hung phaleh, mi hre zing rawh aw,” a ta."

"And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.","Chun, Isu râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Pa, i kutah ka thlarau kân kawltir,” a ta. Chu chu a ti zo chun a thlarau ân thla tah a."

"And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.","Chun, nuhmei Galili rama inthawka ama le hunghai khan an zui pei a, thlân le a ruong inzâlzie chu an hmuh a."
"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.","Chun, in tieng an fe nâwk a, thil rim inhnik le hriek rim inhnikhai an buotsai a. Chun, Châwlni chun thupêk angin an châwl tah a."
"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.","Ni saria ni hmasataka ruok chun, khaw var tâwmin, thil rim inhnik an buotsaihai chu chawiin thlâna chun an va feh a."
And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.,"Chun, thlâna inthawka lung chu inhlum sawnin an hmuh a;"
"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.","chun, an lût a, Lal Isu ruong chu an hmu si nawh."
"And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:","Chun, chuong leia an lunginzîng lai chun, ngai ta, mi pahni puon mi elkhal thei silin an kâwlah an hung ngîr a;"
"and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?","chun, an ṭih a, an hmaia hnuoi an sik el lai chun, anni chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga mithi laia mi dâm in zawng am?"
"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,","[Hitaka hin a um ta nawh, a tho nâwk tah;] Galili rama a um laia in kuoma a thu hril kha hre zing ro."
"saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.","‘Mihriem Naupa hi mi suolhai kuta inmantirin um a ta, krawsah hemdêng an ta, ni thum ni chun a tho nâwk ding a nih,’ a ti kha,” an ta."
"And they remembered his words,","Chun, a thu hrilhai chu an hriet suok tah a,"
"and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.","thlâna inthawk chun an fe nâwk tah a, sâwm le pakhathai kuoma le mi po po kuomah chuong thil po po chu an hril tah a."
"Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.","(Chuong nuhmeihai chu Mag- dalin Mari hai, Joanna hai, Jakob nu Mari hai an nih; an kuoma nuhmei danghai khawmin tirkohai kuoma chun chuong thu chu an hril bawk a."
And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.,"Nisienlakhawm, chuong thu chu thu mei meiah an ruot a, an awipêk nawh a)."
"But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.","[Nisienlakhawm, Peter chu a tho a, thlâna chun a tlân tah a; chun, a kûn a, a bih a; puon zai inhmi umhai chu a hmuh a; chuongchun, thil umzie chu mak titakin in tieng a fe nâwk tah a.]"
"And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.","Chun, ngai ta, chu ni tak chun anni laia mi pahni chu khaw pakhat Emmau an tia chun an fe ding a na, chu chu Jerusalema inthawkin fing sâwmruk a nih."
And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.,"Chun, thil hung tlung po po chu an hril malam pei a."
"And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.","Chun, an hohlima an hril tlâng lai chun Isu ngeiin a hung pan a, ân tlawnpui tah a."
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.,"Nisienlakhawm, ama chu an hriet thei nawna dingin an mit chu sukvaiin a um a."
"And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.","Chun, an kuomah, “Fe malama in thu hril kha ieng am a na?” a ta. Chun, nguitakin an ngîr tah a."
"And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?","Chun, a hming Kleopa lem chun a kuomah, “Jerusalemah makhât chauin amanih i um? Tulaia thil umzie i hriet nawh a,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ieng thil am ie?” a ta. Anni chun a kuom- ah, “Nazareth Isu, Pathien le mi po po mithmua, a thu le a thilthaw zâwlnei hminginthang tak chanchin thu;"
"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.","thiempu lalhai le kan hotuhaiin that thu pêk dingin an ṭhuoi a, krawsa an hemdezie dâm thu kha."
"But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.",Keiniin Israel intlantu ding a ni kan beisei vei leh; chuong ta nêk hmanin chuong thil tlungna chen chu vawisûn leh ni thum a ni tah.
"Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;","Chuong naw khawm chu kan pâwlhai nuhmei ṭhenkhat, zîngkâr a thlânah an va feh a, an mi hung suklungzîng rak a;"
"and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.","a ruong hmu si loin, ‘Pathien vântirkohai inlâr kan hmuh a, chuhai chun a hring nâwk tah ti an hril,’ an hung tih a."
"And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.","Chun, kan umpui laia ṭhenkhat thlâna chun an feh a, nuhmeihai hril ang ngeiin an hmuh a, nisien- lakhawm, ama chu an hmu si nawh a,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Mi invêthai, zâwlneihai thu hril po po awi kawnga ngawnghai!"
"Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?",Kristain chuong thil chu tuorin a ropuinaah a lût ding a ni hrim naw am a nih?” a ta.
"And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.","Chun, Mosie le zâwlneihai po po lekhaah a phut a, Pathien Lekha po poa ama chanchin ziek taphawt chu anni a hrilfie pei a."
"And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.","Chun, an fena ding khuo chu an hung hnai tah a; chun, ama chu hla deua fe tum angin a um a."
"And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.","Chun, ṭawngbauin an chel a, “Kan kuomah um ta la; khuo ân hnu ding an ta hi, nisa khawm a tla ding a ni ta hi,” an ta. Chuongchun, an kuoma um dingin a lût tah a."
"And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.","Chun, an kuoma buthlêng awta a ṭhung laiin bei a lâk a, mal a sâwm a, a khawi a, an kuomah a pêk a."
"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.","Chun, an mit a hung var a, a hmêl an hung hriet tah a; chun, ama chu a bo el tah a."
"And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?","chun, anni chun, “Lampuia a mi biek laia Pathien Lekha Thuhai a mi hrilfie lai khan ei lungril a har huoi hrim naw am a ni kha?” an in tih a."
"And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,","Chun, an tho nghâl tah a, Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a, sâwm le pakhathai le an ruolhai um khâwm chu an hmuh a,"
"saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.","“Lalpa chu a lo thonâwk takzet a nih; Simon kuoma khawm ân lâr tah,” an lo tih a."
"And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.","Chun, anni khawmin lampuia thil hung tlung le, bei a khawia, a hmêl an hung hrietziehai chu an hril veh a."
"And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Chun, chuong thu chu an hril laiin ama ngei chu anni lai a hung ngîr a, [an kuomah, “In chungah thlamuongna um raw se,” a ta.]"
"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.","Nisienlakhawm, râpthlâk an ti bêk bêk a, an ṭih a, thlarau hmuah an inruot a."
"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga in lunginzîng am? Ieng- dinga in lungrila ringhlâna a hung um am?"
"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.","Ka kuthai, ka kephahai hi en ro; hi keima ngei kha ka ni hi! Mi them unla en ro; in mi hmu ang hin chu thlarau chun taksa le ru a nei ve nawh,” a ta."
"And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.","[Chun, chu chu a hril zoin a kuthai, a kephahai an kuomah ân entir a.]"
"And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?","Chun, an lâwm taluo leiin an la awi naw ta rawp a; mak an ti sûngin an kuomah, “Hitaka hin iengkhat fâk ding in nei am?” a ta."
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.,"Chun, nga raw tlin khat an pêk a."
"And he took it, and ate before them.","Chun, a lâk a, an hmaa chun a fâk tah a."
"And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.","Chun, an kuomah, “Hieng hi ka thu kha a nih, Mosie Dâna hai, Zâwlnei Lekhabua hai, Inpâkna Hla bua hai ka chanchin ziek taphawt chu a hung tlung dingzie in kuoma ka um laia ka hril hlak cheu kha,” a ta."
"Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;","Chuongchun, Pathien Lekha Thu hrietna dingin an lungvar a sukvar tah a,"
"and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;","chun, an kuomah, “Hieng ang hin ziek a nih, ‘Krista chun rinum tuor a ta, ni thum niin mithi laia inthawkin thonâwk a tih,"
"and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.","ama hmingin simna thu le suol ngaidamna thu Jerusalema inthawk- in hnam tin kuoma hril nîng a tih,’ tiin."
Ye are witnesses of these things.,Chuong thil po po chu a hrepui- tu in nih.
"And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.","Chun, ngai ta u, ka Pa thil tiem chu in chungah ka hung tir ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, chung tienga inthawka thilthawtheinaa inthuom in ni hmakhat chu khawpuia hin um zing ro,” a ta."
"And he led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.","Chun, Bethani khaw kâwl chenin anni a ṭhuoi a; chun, a bân a phar a, mal a sâwmpêk a."
"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.","Chun, mal a sâwmpêk lai takin anni chu a mâksan a, [vâna zuk ṭhuoiin a um tah a.]"
"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:","Chun, [chibai an bûk a,] lâwm bêk bêkin Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a;"
"and were continually in the temple, blessing God.","chun, Pathien biekina chun Pathien inpâkin an um rawp hlak."
"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituræa and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,","Chun, Tiberia Kaisar ân lala in- thawka kum sâwmpanga kumah (Pontia Pilat chu Judai ram Bawrsâp a na, Herod chu Galili ram lal a nih, a unau Philip chu Iturea le Trakonitis ram lal a nih, Lusani chu Abilene ram lal a nih."
"in the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.","Anna le Kaiapha chu Thiempu Laltakhai an nih), thlalêra Zakaria naupa Johan kuoma chun Pathien thu a hung tlung a."
"And he came into all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins;","Chun, ama chu Jordan vadung pang vêl ram tinah a feh a, thil suksuol ngaidamna dingin simna baptisma thu a hril pei a."
"as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.","Zâwlnei Isai thu buah, “Thlalêra mi khêk râwl chun, ‘Lalpa lamlien buotsai unla; A lampuihai suktlûn ro;"

And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.,"Chun, mi po poin Pathien sandamna hmûng an tih,’ a ta,” tia ziek ang khan."
"He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?","Chun, ama chun baptisma chang dinga a kuoma mipui hung suokhai kuoma chun, “Rûl thlahai, lungsen hung tlung ding hi tlânsan dingin tuin am a kâwk cheu a?"
"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.","Chuongchun, sim hming input tlâkin ra ro, ‘Abraham kan thlatu a nih annâwm,’ in lungrilin ti el naw ro; Pathienin hieng lunghai hi Abraham thlaahai ân ngîrtir thei ti ka hril cheu hi."
"And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.","Tu ngei khawm hin hreipui thing bul tinah an sie tah; chuongchun, thing tin ra ṭhaa ra naw taphawt chu an phûr a, meiah an pei hlak,” a ta."
"And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?","Chun, mipuihai chun a kuomah, “Anleh ieng am kan thaw ding a na?” an ta, an indawn a."
"And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Tu- khawm zakuo pahni nei chun a nei naw kuomah pe raw se; tukhawm fâk nei chun chuong ang bawkin thaw raw se,” a ta, a dawn a."

"And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you.","Ama chun an kuomah, “An rêlpêk cheu bâk chu va phût naw ro,” a ta."
"And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do?

"And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ;","Chun, mihaiin an beisei a, mi po poin Johan chungthu an lungrilah, “Krista a lo ni el khat rawi am?” tia an ngaituo laiin,"
"John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:","Johan chun a dawn a, an rênga kuomah, “Kei chun chu tuiin ka baptis hlak cheu a; nisienlakhawm, keia nêka ropui lem a hung ding a nih, a kekawk hrui sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh; ama chun Thlarau Inthieng le meiin baptis a ti cheu a,"

"And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.","Chun, lekhabu chu a ziel a, rawngbâwltu a pêk nâwk a, a ṭhung tah a. Chun, inkhâwmna ina mi po po mit chu ama chungah a fuh a."
"And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.","Chun, an kuomah, “Hi Pathien Lekha Thu hi vawisûn hin in ihrietah a hung tlung tah,” tiin a hril ṭan a."
"And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?","Chun, an rêngin ama an inpâk a, a bausuok lunginsietna thu dâm chu mak an ti hleh a. “Hi pa hi Josef naupa a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Hi ṭawngbau hi, ‘Dâktawr, nang in- sukdam rawh,’ ‘Kapernauma i thil- thaw kan lo hriet taphawt kha, nangma khuo tieng khawm hin thaw ve rawh,’ tiin in mi la ti ngei âwm de hi,” a ta."
"And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, zâwlnei tukhawm mâni khuo tieng mîn an lâwm ngai nawh."
"But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;","Chuongchun, indiktakin ka hril cheu, Elija dam laia kum thum le thla ruk vân a ping a, khawvêla ṭâm nasatak a hung tla khan, Israel ramah hmeithai tamtak an um a;"
"and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.","nisienlakhawm, anni laia tukhawm kuomah Elija tir a ni nawh a, Sidon ram tienga Sarepta, nuhmei pakhat hmeithai kuoma chau tir a ni lem kha."
"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.","Chun, zâwlnei Elisa dam lai khawm khan Israel ramah inphâr tamtak an um a; nisienlakhawm, Naaman Suria rama mi chau naw chu anni laia tukhawm sukthiengin an um naw kha,” a ta."
"And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things;","Chun, inkhâwmna ina mi po po chun, chuong thu chu an hriet phingleh an lunginsen ta bêk bêk a,"
"and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.","an tho tâwl a, khuoa inthawk chun an nam dawk a, pei thlâk dingin an khuo umna râwl khoa chun an ṭhuoi tah a."
But he passing through the midst of them went his way.,"Nisienlakhawm, ama chu an kârah a fe thleng a, a fe ta pei a."
"And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day:","Chun, Galili rama khuo pakhat, Kapernauma chun an zu feh a, Châwlni chun mihai ân chûktir a;"
and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.,"chun, thuneitaka a hril leiin a thu inchûktir chu mak an ti hleh a."
"And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,","Chun, inkhâwmna ina chun khawhri inthieng naw thlarau nei mi pakhat a lo um a; ama chu râwl inringtakin,"
"Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.","“A! Nazareth Isu, keini le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna? A mi sukbohmang dingin i hung a ni maw? Nang ka hriet che, Pathien Mi Inthieng i nih,” tiin a khêk suok a."
"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.","Chun, Isûn a hal a, “To la, a sûnga inthawkin hung suok rawh,” a ta. Chun, khawhri chun a laiah a sukthlûk zet a, sukna loin a sûnga inthawk chu a hung suok tah a."
"And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.","Chun, an rêngin mak an ti hleh a, “Hi hi ieng thu am a ni leh? Thu neitak le thilthawtheitakin khawhri inthieng nawhai thu a pêk a, an suok hi,” tiin an inbiek a."
And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.,"Chun, chu lai ram khaw tinah a chanchin ân thang tah a."
"And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her.","Chun, a tho a, inkhâwmna ina inthawk chu a suok a, Simon inah a lût tah a. Chun, Simon nuhmei nu chu nasatakin a khuo a sik a, chuong- chun, a ta dingin an lo ngênpêk a."
"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.","Chun, a kâwlah a ngîr a, khawsik chu a hal a, a bo tah a; chun, a tho nghâl tah a, an rawng a bâwlpêk a."
"And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.","Chun, nisa tlâk ding laiin natna tum tuma na, damnaw nei taphawtin a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; chun, an rênga chunga chun kut ân nghat seng a, a sukdam ta pei a."
"And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.","Chun, khawhrihai khawm, “Pathien Naupa i nih,” tia khêkin, mi tamtak sûnga inthawkin an hung suok a. Chun, anni a hal a, Krista a nih ti an hriet leiin an ṭawng a phal nawh a."
"And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.","Chun, khawvar phingleh a suok a, thlalêr hmunah a feh a; chun, mipuihai chun an zawng a, a kuomah an hung a, anni a fe san nawna dingin chel an tum a."
"But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Khaw dangahai khawm Pathien ram Chanchin Ṭha ka hril ding a nih, chu lei tak chun tir ka ni sih a,” a ta."
And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.,"Chuongchun, Judai rama in- khâwmna inahai thu a hril a."
"Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;","Chun, mipuiin Pathien thu an ngai a, ama an bâwr hut hut laiin, ama chu Gennesaret dîl panga chun a ngîr a."
"and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.","Chun, dîl panga chun lawng pahni a um a hmuh a; nisien- lakhawm, nga mantuhai chu an suok a, an lênhai an sâwp a."
"And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.","Chuongchun, lawng pakhat Simon ta lema chun a chuong a, a kuomah vapanga inthawka tlâwmtea intâwl lût hret a hnih a. Chun, a ṭhung a, lawnga inthawk chun mipuihai chu ân chûktir tah a."
"And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.","Chun, thu hril a ma chun, Simon kuomah, “Li inthûk tieng pan la, nga man dingin, in lênhai dêng rawh,” a ta."
"And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets.","Chun, Simonin a kuomah, “In- chûktirtu, inrimtakin zânkhawvârin kan thawh a, iengkhawm kan man nawh a; nisienlakhawm, i thuin lênhai dêng nâwk ka tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking;","Chun, an hei dêng chun nga nasatak an inkhum a, an lênhai chu ân tan ṭhawt ṭhawt a."
"and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.","Lawng danga an pâwl umhai chu anni hung ṭhangpui dingin kutin an hui a. Chun, an hung a, lawng pahni chu tlum vâng vâng khawpin an sung sip ve veh a."
"But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.","Chun, Simon Peterin chu chu a hmu chun, Isu khûp bulah a bawkkhup a, “Lalpa, mi fe san rawh, mi suol ka ni hi,” a ta."
"For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;",An nga man chu ama le a ruolhai chun mak an ti hleh a.
"and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.","Simon ruolhai bawk, Zebedai naupa Jakob le Johan khawmin mak an ti hle bawk a. Chun, Isûn Simon kuomah, “Ṭi naw, tuta hnung chu mihriem man tâng i tih,” a ta."
"And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.","Chun, an lawnghai chu vapangah an ṭhuoi kai a, iengkim mâksanin ama an zui tah a."
"And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","Chun, khaw pakhata a um laiin, ngai ta, mi pakhat inphârnain a bâwm hi a um a, ama chun Isu a lo hmuh a, hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, “Lalpa, i nuom chun i mi sukthieng thei,” a ta, a ngên a."
"And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him.","Chun, ama chun a hei ban a, a them a, “Ka nuom ie, hung inthieng ta raw khai,” a ta. Chun, kârloin a phârna chu a hung bo nghâl tah a."
"And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","Chun, a kuomah, “Tukhawm hril naw rawh, amiruokchu, thiempu kâwlah vân entir la, i în thienna dingin Mosie ruot angin inhlân rawh, mihai inhriettirna dingin,” a ti tlat a."
"But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.","Nisienlakhawm, a chanchin thu chu ân thang nâwk zuol det a; mipui nasatak a thu hre nuom le an natnahai sukdam nuomin an hung inkhâwm a."
"But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu thla- lêra dâm atumin a feh a, a ṭawngṭai hlak a."
"And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judæa and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.","Chun, chuong lai chun, ni khat chu ân chûktir a. Chun, a kâwlah Pharisaihai le dân hretuhai ṭhungin an um a, chuonghai chu Galili ram le, Judai ram khaw tina inthawk le Jerusalema inthawka hung suok an na; chun mi sukdamna dingin Lalpa thilthawtheina chu a kuomah a um a."
"And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.","Chun, ngai ta, khum pumin zeng pakhat an hung zâwn a; a hmaa sie dingin zâwn lût an tum a."
"And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.","Chun, mipui lei chun zâwn lûtna hrim an hmu nawh a, in chungah an hang lâwn a, in chunga inthawkin a laitakah, Isu hmaah, a khum pumin an inkhai thlâktir a."
"And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.","Chun, an ringzie chu a lo hmuin, a kuomah, “Mihriem, i suol- hai ngaidam a ni tah ie,” a ta."
"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai chun, “Pathien hrilsie hi tu am a ni leh? Pathien chau naw chun tuin am suolhai a ngaidam thei a?” tiin an ngaituoh a."
"But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?","Chuongchun, Isûn an ngaituo chu a hriet a, an kuomah, “In lungrilah ieng am in ngaituoh a?"
"Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?","‘I suolhai ngaidam a ni tah,’ ti le, ‘Tho la kein fe rawh’ ti hi a ieng am hril a awl lem a?"
"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.","Iengkhawm ni sienla khaw- vêlah Mihriem Naupa hin suol ngaidam theina a nei ti in hrietna dingin,” a ta, (zeng kuoma chun) “Tho la, i khum la la, i inah fe rawh ka ti che hi,” a ta."
"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.","Chuongchun, an mithmuah a tho nghâl tah a, a zâlna chu a lâk a, Pathien inpâk pum peiin a inah a fe tah a."
"And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.","Chun, an rêngin mak an ti hleh a, Pathien an inpâk a, “Vawisûn chu thil maktak ei hmu a nih,” an tih a, an ṭi bêk bêk a."
"And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.","Chun, chuong zoa chun, a suok a, sie chawina hmuna ṭhung, sie- dâwltu pakhat a hming Levi a hmuh a; chun, a kuomah, “Mi hung zui rawh,” a ta."
"And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.","Chuongchun, iengkim a mâk- san a, a tho a, a zui tah a."
And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.,"Chun, Levi chun a inah Isu ta dingin ruoi ropuitak a ṭheh a; chuongchun, siedâwltuhai, mi dang- hai leh mi tamtakin anni an awtpui tâwl a."
"And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?","Chun, Pharisaihai, an Dân inchûktirtuhai le chun a închûktirhai chungah an chier a, “Ieng dinga siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai lai in fâk a in dâwn am a na?” an tih a."
"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Mi hrisêlhai chun dâktawr an ngai nawh a, mi hrivawisiehai lemin an ngai a nih."
I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.,"Mi feltakhai lam dinga hung ka ni nawh a, mi suolhai lama insimtir dinga hung ka ni lem,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.","Chun, annîn a kuomah, “Johan inchûktirhaiin bu an nghei rawp a, an ṭawngṭai hlak; Pharisai inchûktirhai khawmin chuong ang bawkin an thaw hlak; nisienlakhawm, i închûk- tirhai hin an fâkin an dâwn hlak,” an ta."
"And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?","Isûn an kuomah, “Mo ṭhuoi- tuhai kuoma a pasal ding chu a um sûng po mo ṭhuoituhai chu in inngheitir thei hlak am a nih?"
"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.","Nisienlakhawm, a pasal ding chu an kuoma inthawka ṭhuoi hmang nihai la tlung a ta, chu ni ruok chun la nghei an tih,” a ta."
"And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.","Chun, an kuomah tekhithu khawm a hril a; “Tukhawmin puon thar kei thlain puon hlui an phâwk ngai nawh; phâwk ang sienla a thar chun sukthlêr a ta, a thar hlek le a hlui chu inhme bawk naw ni."
"And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.","Chun, tukhawmin uoin thar savun uoin peng hluiahai an thun ngai nawh; thun ang sienla, uoin thar chun savun penghai chu mawr kawi a ta, inbuong a ta, savun penghai khawm chu sieng a tih."
But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.,Uoin thar chu savun peng tharahai an thun lem ding a nih.
"And no man having drunk old wine desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.","Chun, tukhawmin uoin um sâwt dâwn zoin uoin thar an du ngai nawh; ‘a um sâwt a ṭha lem’ an ti sih a,” a ta."
"Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.","Chun, Châwlni vawikhat chu bu bilahai a fe thleng a, a închûktirhai chun bu vuihai chu an thliek a, an kutphaah an nuoi fai a, an fâk a."
"But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?","Chun, Pharisai tuhaiin amani chun, “Ieng dinga Châwlnia thaw thieng naw chu in thaw am a na?” an tih a."
"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him;","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, “A ruolhai le an phîngṭam laia David thilthaw kha in tiem naw am a nih?"
"how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone?","Khânga Pathien inah a lût a, thiempuhai chau naw chun fâk thieng lo entirna bei chu a lâk a, a fâk a, a ruolhai khawm a pêk ve thu kha,” a ta."
"And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuoma chun, “Mihriem Naupa hi Châwlni Lal a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.","Chun, Châwlni danga chun inkhâwmna inah a lût a, ân chûktir a; chutaka chun mi pakhat kut chang- tieng zeng a lo um a."
"And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him.","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai chun, a hêkna ding an hmu theina dingin, châwlni chun a sukdam ding le ding naw an enthlit a."
"But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an lungril chu a hriet a, kut zeng kuoma chun, “Tho la, a laiah ngîr dawk rawh,” a ta. Chun, a tho a, a ngîr dawk tah a."
"And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Châwlni hin sukṭhat am a thienga, suksiet? Sandam am a thienga, sukhlum? kân dawn cheu a nih,” a ta."
"And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored.","Chun, an rêng chun a en vêl a, a kuomah, “I kut phar rawh,” a ta. Chun, a phar a, a kut chu a dam tah a."
But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.,"Chuongchun, an lungsen chun an puokkawi vâng vâng a, Isu chunga an thaw dân ding an inrâwn a."
"And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.","Chun, chuong lai chun a suok a, ṭawngṭai dingin tlângah a feh a, Pathien kuomah a ṭawngṭai zân- khuoh a."
"And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:","Chun, khawvar phingleh a închûktirhai chu a ko a; anni laia mi sâwm le pahni a thlang a, an hminga khawm tirko ân bûk a;"
"Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,","chuonghai chu Simon (Peter ân bûk bawk chu) le a unau Andri hai, Jakob le Johan hai, Philip le Bartholomai hai,"
"and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphæus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,","Matthai le Thoma hai, Alphai naupa Jakob hai, Simon Zelot an ti hai,"
"and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;","Jakob naupa Juda hai, ân mantirtu ding Juda Iskariot hai an nih."
"and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judæa and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;","Chun, anni ruolin a fe thlah a, hmun inzâwlah a ngîr a, a închûk- tirhai mipui nasatak leh, Judai ram po poa inthawk le Jerusalema inthawk le Tura le Sidon khuo tienga tuisuoriet panga inthawk mi tamtak leh;"
and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.,"chuonghai chu a thu ngai nuom le an natnahai insukdam nuomin an hung a nih; chuongchun, khawhri inthieng naw isawisakhai khawm an hung dam tah a."
"And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed them all.","Chun, a kuoma inthawka thil- thawtheina suoka mi tin a sukdam pei leiin, mipui po po chun ama them an tum a."
"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.","Chun, a dâk suok a, a închûk- tirhai chu a en a, “Nangni rimsihai, in hamṭha ie, Pathien ram in ta a ni sih a."
Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.,"“Nangni tuta phîngṭamhai, in hamṭha ie; in la khawp ding a ni sih a. “Nangni tuta ṭaphai, in hamṭha ie; in lân nui ding a ni sih a."
"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.","“Mihriem Naupa leia mihaiin an theida cheu a, an tuithlâra an hal cheu a, in hming a ṭha nawh tia an pei hmang dêr phaleh in la hamṭha ding a nih."
"Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.","Chu ni chun lâwm unla, hlimin inchâwm ro; ngai ta u, vânah in lâwmman a um râwn sih a; chuong ang bawkin an thlatuhaiin zâwlnei- hai chungah an thaw hlak kha."
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.,"“Amiruokchu, nangni mi hausa- hai, in chung a rik ie; in thlamuongna in hmu ta sih a."
"Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.","“Nangni tuta khawphai, in chung a rik ie; in phîng a la ṭâm ding a ni sih a. “Nang ni tuta innuihai, in chung a rik ie; lungngaiin in la ṭap ding a ni sih a."

"But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,","“Ka thu ngaituhai, ka hril cheu hi, in hmêlmahai chu hmangai unla, a theidahai cheu chu an ṭhatna ding thaw unla,"
"bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.","ṭawngsie inphurtuhai cheu chu malsâwmpêk unla, a sawisatuhai cheu chu ṭawngṭaipêk ro."
To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.,"“Bieng khing tienga bentu cheu chu khing tieng khawm dâwpêk ro; chun, i puon lâkpêktu che kuoma chun i zakuo lâk khawm sêl naw."
Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.,"“A hnitu taphawt che kuomah pe rawh; chun, i thil lâkpêktu che kuoma chun hni nâwk ta naw rawh."
"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.","“Chun, mîn in chunga an thaw dinga in dit ang peiin mi chunga khawm thaw ve ro."
"And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.","“Chun, nangni hmangaituhai chau in hmangai hin, lâwm ieng am hlâwng in ta? Mi suolhai khawmin anni hmangaituhai chu an hmangai hlak annâwm."
"And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.","Chun, in chunga ṭhahai chunga chau in ṭha hin lâwm ieng am hlâwng in ta? Mi suolhai khawmin chuong ang bawkin an thaw annâwm."
"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.","Chun, hmu nâwk beiseina kuom chaua thil in inpûktir hin lâwm ieng am hlâwng in ta? mi suolhai khawmin a ngai bawka hmu nâwk dingin misuolhai kuomah an inpûktir hlak."
"But love your enemies, and do them good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.","Amiruokchu, in hmêlmahai hmangai unla, an ṭhatna ding thaw unla, inpûktir ro, beidawng dêr loin; chuongchun, in lâwmman tam a ta, Achunghnungtak nauhai ni bawk in tih; ama chun mi lâwmnachâng hre lohai le mi suolhai a lunginsiet hlak."

"And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released:","“Sawisêl naw ro, chuongchun, sawisêlin um naw ti niu.

"give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.","Pe ro, chuongchun pêkin um in tih, ṭhahnemngaitaka inkhia, nam- dêna, sâwi muka, liem zar zara, in mal chungah pêk nîng in tih.

"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","“Chun, ieng dinga mâni mita tlungpûm um chu ngaituo si loa, i unau mita hmawl hlek um chu i hmu am a na?"
"Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.","Mâni mita tlungpûm um chu hmu si loin, i unau kuomah, ‘Unau, i mita hmawl hlek um kha mîn lâk dawk tir rawh,’ iengtin am i ti thei a?

For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.,“Thing ṭha hrim hrim ra sea ra a um nawh; thing ṭha naw hlak ra ṭhaa ra a um bawk nawh.
"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.","Thing tin anni ra sengah ân hriet a nih. Mîn hruihlingnei kûngah theichang an lo ngai nawh, nghardai kûngah grêp an lo ngai bawk nawh."
The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.,Mi ṭha chun a lungril ro bâwm ṭhaa inthawkin thil ṭhahai a the suok hlak; mi suol chun a lungril ro bâwm siea inthawkin thil ṭha nawhai a the suok hlak; a lungril sip liem chu a bauin a hril suok el hlak a ni sih a.

"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.","Amiruokchu, hrea zâwm naw chu, lung phûm loa, hnuoi chung ela in bâwltu ang chu an nih; tuihrâtin chu chu a khawh a, a chim nghâl tah a: a chim chu nasatak a nih,” a ta."
"After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.","Chun, mihai hrieta a thu po po a hril zoin, Kapernaumah a lût a."
"And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death.","Chun, sipai za hotu tû amanih a suok dittak a dam nawh a, a thi vâng vâng a."
"And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.","Chuongchun, Isu chanchin a hriet phingleh a suok chu hung sukdam dinga ngên hrâm dingin a kuomah Juda upahai a tir a."
"And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him;","Chun, anni chu Isu kuom an va tlung a, ṭhahnemngaitakin an ngên a, “Ama hi, i thawpêk tlâk a nih:"
"for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.","ei hnam dâm a hmangai a, kan inkhâwmna in dâm a mi bâwlpêk a nih,” an ta."
"And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:","Chuongchun, Isu chun anni a zui tah a.

"wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.","chuleiin, i kuoma hung tlâk khawm niin kân ring nawh a, thu chau hril la ka naupang dam el a tih."
"For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.","Kei khawm mi thua um ka na, ka hnuoiah sipaihai an um a; hi mipa kuoma hin, ‘Fe rawh’ ka ti leh a feh a; mi dang kuoma khawm, ‘Hung rawh’ ka ti leh a hung hlak; ka suok kuoma khawm, ‘Hi hi thaw rawh,’ ka ti leh a thaw hlak,” a ta."
"And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.","Chun, Isûn chuong thu chu a hrietin ama chu mak a ti hleh a, a nghah a, mipui a zuituhai kuoma chun, “Ka hril cheu hi, Israelhai lai khawm hieng ang lâwma ringna nasa hi ka hmu nawh,” a ta."
"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.","Chun, a mi tirhai chu in tieng an fe nâwk a, suok chu damin an hmu tah a."
"And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.","Chun, sâwt nawteah khaw pa- khat Nain an tia chun a feh a; a închûktirhai le mipui nasatak a kuomah an fe veh a."
"Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.","Chun, kul kawtkhâr kâwl a tlungin, ngai ta, mithi an hung zâwn dawk a, a nu naupa nei sun a na, ama hlak hmeithai a ni sih a; an khuohai tamtak chu a kuomah an um a."
"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.","Chun, Lalpa chun hmeithai chu a hmu phingleh a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, “Ṭap naw,” a ta."
"And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.","Chun, a va hnai a, hlâng chu a them a; chuongchun, a zâwntuhai chu an ngîr a. Chun, “Tlangvâl, tho rawh ka ti che hi,” a ta."
"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.","Chun, mithi chu a ṭhung dawk a, a hung ṭawng tah a. Chun, Isûn a nu kuomah a pêk tah a."
"And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.","Chun, mi po poin an ṭih a, Pathien an inpâk a, “Eini lai zâwlnei ropuitak a hung um ta a ni hi,” an ta. “Pathienin a mihai a hung sîr tah a nih,” an ti bawk a."
"And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judæa, and all the region round about.","Chun, chu mipa chungchâng thu chu Judai ram po po le a kâwl vêl ram tinah ân thang suok tah a."
And the disciples of John told him of all these things.,"Chun, Johan inchûktirhai chun chuong thu po po chu Johan an hril a."
"And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?","Chuongchun, Johan chun a închûktirhai pahni a ko a, Lalpa kuoma chun a tir a, “A hung ding chu i ni, mi dang am kan la ngai ding?” tiin."

In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.,"Chun, chuong lai tak chun Isûn damnaw dâm, hripui invawihai, khawhri imanhai tamtak a sukdam a, mitdel tamtak khawm an mit a sukvar a."
"And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them.","Chun, an kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta unla, thil in hmu le in hriet hi Johan va hril ro; mitdelhai an mit a hung var tah, kebaihai kein an lâwn tah, inphârhai an hung inthieng tah, nasêthai an na a hung var tah, mi- thihai keithoin an um tah, pasiehaiin Chanchin Ṭha hril an dawng tah."
"And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.","Chun, tûkhawm ka chunga lungninawna hmu naw chu an hamṭha,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?","Chun, Johan mi tirhai chu an fe hnungin Isûn mipuihai kuoma chun Johan thu a hril tah a, “Ieng en dingin am thlalêra khan in hang feh a?

"I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he.","Nuhmei sûnga insieng laia chun Johan nêka ropui lem an um nawh; nisienlakhawm, Pathien rama mi chîn tak khawm ama nêkin an ropui lem,” a ta."
"And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.","Chun, mi po poin an hrietin, siedâwltuhai leh, Johan baptisma lo chang tah an na, Pathien an inthiem a."
"But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.","Pharisaihai le dânhretuhai ruok chu a kuoma baptisma lo chang tah an ni ve nawh a, anni ta dinga Pathienin rem a iruotpêk chu an pawm nawh."
"Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?","Chuongchun, Isu bawkin, “Tu- lai ruoltharhai hi ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka tih aw?"
"They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep.","Naupang dâwr hmuna ṭhunga, ‘Theihle kan mûtpêk cheu a, in lâm si nawh a; kan ṭap rak a, in ṭap si nawh a,’ tia inkhêkkhumhai ang hi an nih."

"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!","Mihriem Naupa a hung a, a fâkin a dâwn a, ‘En ta u, bu he mi, uoin he mi, siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai ruolpa saw!’ in ti sih a."
And wisdom is justified of all her children.,"Nisienlakhawm, Varna chu a nau po poin an inthiem,” a ta."
"And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.","Chun, Pharisaihai laia mi pakhatin a kuomah bu fa dingin a fiel a. Chun, Pharisai ina chun a lût a, thlaithlêng a awt a."
"And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,","Chun, ngai ta, chu khuoa nu- hmei suol pakhat um chun, Pharisai inah thlaithlêng awtin a ṭhung ti a hriet phingleh alabastar bûrin hriek rim inhnik a hung chawi a."
"and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.","A hnungah a kepha bula chun ṭap pumin a ngîr a, a mitthliin a kepha a lo far huh a, a samin a hrûk a, a kepha chu a fâwp a, hriek rim inhnik chun a nâl a."
"Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.","Chun, a fieltu Pharisai chun a hmu chun, a lungrilin, “Hi mipa hi zâwlnei a ni chun a themtu nuhmei hi tu am a ni, mi ieng ang am a ni hre âwm tak, mi suol a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Simon, i kuomah thu bau khat hril ding ka nei,” a ta, a dawn a. Chun, ama chun, “Hril ta la, Inchûktirtu,” a ta."
"A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.","Chun, Isûn “Tangka inpûktirtu tuin amanih leibattu pahni a nei a; pakhatin duli za nga a bat a, pakhatin sâwmnga."
"When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?","Chun, thungna an nei nawh a, a ngaidam ve veh a. Chuongchun, chuhai chun a tû lem chun am ama chu hmangai lem an ta?” a ta."
"Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.","Simon chun, “A ingaidam tam lem chun niin ka ring,” a ta, a dawn a. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “I ti dik ie,” a ta."
"And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.","Chun, nuhmei tieng chu a nghah a, Simon kuoma chun, “Hi nuhmei hi i hmu?

"Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.",Nangin fâwp hrim hrim i mi fâwp nawh; ama ruok hin chu ka hung lût hlima inthawk ka kepha fâwp a ma nawh.
My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.,Nangin ka luah hriek i mi nâl nawh; ama ruok hin chu ka kepha hriek rim inhnik a nâl.
"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.","Chuleiin, ka ti che hi, a suol tamtak kha ngaidamin a um tah; ama khawmin a hmangai ta bêk bêk a ni hi; amiruokchu, ngaidam tlâwm chun, tlâwmtêin a hmangai hlak,” a ta."
"And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.","Chun, nuhmei kuoma chun, “I suolhai ngaidam a ni tah,” a ta."
"And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins?","Chun, a thlaithlêng awtpuihai chun, “Suolhai khawm ngaidam hi tu am a na?” an in tih a."
"And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.","Chun, ama chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “I ringna hi sandam I ni pha a nih, thlamuongtakin fe rawh,” a ta."
"And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,","Chun, a nakie deu chun Isu thu hril le Pathien ram Chanchin Ṭha intlun pei pumin khaw lien le khaw têhai a fang pei a, a kuomah sâwm le pahnihai chu an um a;"
"and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,","nuhmei tuhai amanih, khawhri zâwl dam nâwkhai leh, na dam nâwkhai leh, chuong nuhmeihai chu Mari, a sûnga inthawka khawhri pasari suok Magdalin an iti hai,"
"and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.","Herod sum enkawltu Chuza nu- hmei Joanna hai, Susanna hai, mi dang tamtak leh an nih; chuonghai chun mâni neiin an rawng an bâwlpêk a."
"And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:","Chun, mipui nasatak an hung inkhâwm a, khaw tina mi a kuomah an hungin, tekhithuin thu a hril a."
"The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.","“Bu chi thêtu bu chi thê dingin a feh a. Chun, a thê laiin a ṭhen lampui sîrah a tla a, mîn an sir a, chun, vatehaiin an tlân zo tah a."
"And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.","Chun, a ṭhen pielthlêng chungah a tlah a; a mâwng phingleh a hnâwng naw leiin a rawp tah a."
"And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.","Chun, a ṭhen hlohlingnei lai a tlah a, hlo chun a mâwng ruolpui a, a dîp hmang tah a."
"And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Chun, a ṭhen hnuoi ṭhaah a tlah a, a hung mâwng a, a lêt zain a ra tah a,” a ta. Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin a khêk a, “Tûkhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.,"Chun, a închûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Hi tekhithu hi ieng tina am a na?” tiin an indawn a."
"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.","Ama chun, “Pathien ram thurûk chu nangni ihriet chu phal a na, mi dang kuoma ruok chu tekhithu chaua hril a nih; hmu hai sienla khawm, hmu naw an ni theina dingin, nain hrehai sienla khawm a ngaina an hriet thei nawna dingin."
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.,“Tekhithu kha hi hi a nih; Bu chi chu Pathien thu a nih.
"And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.","Chun, lampui sîra mi chu thu hre tahai hi an nih; chun, diebol chu a hung a, an awi nawh a, sandam an ni thei nawna dingin an lungrila inthawkin thu a lâkpêk hlak."
"And those on the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.","Chun, pielthlêng chunga mi chu hieng hi an nih; an hriet phingleh thu chu lâwmtaka pawmhai hi; nisien- lakhawm, zung hrim an nei nawh, sâwt nawtê chau an awi a, thlêma an um phaleh an bânsan nâwk hlak."
"And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.","Chun, hlohlingnei laia tla chu hieng mi hi an nih; thu an hriet hnunga an fe pei laiin dam sûng khawsak lungkhamnahai, inhawitir- nahai, hausaknahai chun a dîp a, an ra puitling ngainaw a nih."
"And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.","Hnuoi ṭhaa mi chu hieng hi an nih; lungril ṭha le felin thu chu an hriet a, an vawn zing a, tuorseltakin an ra hlak."
"And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.","“Tukhawmin khâwnvar insitin bêlin an inkhum nawh, khum hnuoia khawm an sie nawh; a lût taphawtin a var an hmu theina dingin a sienaah an sie lem hlak a nih."
"For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor anything secret, that shall not be known and come to light.","Phuong lo dinga ip iengkhawm a um nawh, hriet naw ding le inlang lo dinga thuphmang iengkhawm a um bawk nawh."
"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.","Chuongchun, ieng angin am in hriet fimkhur ro; tûkhawm a nei taphawt chu pe sâng an ta, tûkhawm a nei naw taphawt chu a nei suna a ruot khawm chu lâkpêk an tih,” a ta."
"And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.","Chun, a nu le a unauhai chun Isu kuom tieng an hung pan a, nisienlakhawm, mipui lei chun a kuom an hung tlung thei si nawh."
"And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.","Chun, “I nu le i unauhai nang hmu ding chein tuola sawn an ngîr zing ie,” tiin an hril a."
"But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Hieng Pathien thu hrea zâwmhai hi ka nu le ka unauhai an nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.","Chun, chuong lai chun ni khat chu lawngah a chuong a, a închûktirhai leh; chun, an kuomah, “Dîl râl khingtieng sawn kai ei tiu,” a ta. Chuongchun, lawng chu an sût a, an fe tah a."
"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.","Chun, an fe laiin Isu a lo in innghil a; chun, dîla chun thlipui a hung hrâng a, an lawng chu tuiin a sip vâng vâng a, nasataka ṭitumnaah an um tah a."
"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.","Chun, a kuomah an va feh a, an keitho a, “Inchûktirtu, Inchûktirtu, kan bohmang ding a ni hi teh,” an ta. Chun, ama chu a hung har a, thli le tuifâwn chu a hal tah a; chun, a mah a, a re tah a."
"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?","Chun, an kuomah, “In ringna khâwlai am a um a?” a ta. Chun, an ṭih a, mak an ti hleh a, “Hi mipa hi tu am a ni leh? thli le tui chen khawm thu a pêk a, an awi hi,” an inti tâwl a."
"And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.","Chun, Galili ram zâwna Gerasin mihai ram chu an tlung a."
"And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in any house, but in the tombs.","Chun, khawmuola a suokin, khuoa mi khawhri iman tûin amanih ân tuokpui a; ina hrim khawm a um nawh a, thlânahai a um lem hlak a."
"And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.","Chun, Isu a hmu phingleh a khêk a, a hmaah a bawkkhup a, râwl inringtakin, “Isu, Pathien Achung- hnungtak Naupa, kei le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna a um a? mi sawisa lul naw rawh, ka ngên che,” a ta."
"For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.","(Isûn khawhri inthieng naw chu, chu mipa sûnga inthawka suok dingin thu a lo pêk ta sih a. Chu mipa chu khawhri chun a man rawp hlak a nih; mihaiin khaidiet le kawl an inbuntir hlak a, an vêng zing hlak a; nisienlakhawm, a khuopnahai chu a suktan a, khawhri chun thlalêrahai a hnawt suok hlak)."
"And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.","Chun, Isûn, “I hming ieng am a na?” tiin ân dawn a. Ama chun, “Nuoia,” a ta, (a sûnga khawhri tamtak an lût leiin)."
And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.,"Chun, vânsama fe thu an kuoma pe lo dingin Isu kuomah an ngên a."
Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.,"Chun, chutaka chun tlângah vawk ruol tamtak an tlah a; chun, a kuomah, vawkhai sûngah lût theina thu an ngên a. Chun, ama chun thu a pêk a."
"And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.","Chun, khawhrihai chu chu mipa sûnga inthawk chun an suok a, vawkhai sûnga chun an lût a; chun, vawk ruol chu râwlah an tlân thla hum hum a, dîlah an tlân lût a, tui inhâkin an thi tah a."
"And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.","Chun, a vaituhai chun chu thil umzie chu an hmuh a, an tlân a, khuoa le loahai chun an hril a."
"And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.","Chun, thil um dân chu en dingin mihai an suok tâwl a; chun, Isu kuom an hung tlung a, khawhri isuoksanpa chu puon sila lungvar pângngai putin, Isu ke bula ṭhung an hung hmuh a; chuongchun, an ṭi tah a."
And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.,"Chun, a hretuhai chun khawhri iman a sukdamzie chu chuonghai chu an lo hril a."
"And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.","Chun, a vêl Gerasin mihai rama mi po po chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk leiin, ama chu an kuoma inthawka fe hmang dingin an ngên a; chun, lawngah a chuong a, a kîr nâwk tah a."
"But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,","Chun, khawhri isuoksanpa ruok khan chu Isu kuoma um zing a ngên a."
"Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn, “I in tieng fe la, Pathienin i ta dinga thil a thawpêk che ropuizie hi va hril rawh,” tiin ân fetir tah a. Chuongchun, a feh a, khawpui sûng po poa chun Isûn a ta dinga thil a thawpêk ropuizie chu a khêkpui tah a."
"And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.","Chun, Isu a hung kîr nâwk chun mipuiin ama an lâwm a, ama lo nghâk zinga um an ni tâwl leiin."
"And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat a hming Jaira, inkhâwmna in hotu chu a hung a, Isu ke bulah a bawkkhup a, a ina fe dingin a ngên a,"
"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.","naunu khât kum sâwmpahni lai ding hi a nei a, ama chu thihmun- suolin a zâl zing leiin. Chun, Isu a fe laiin mipuihaiin an hneng sup sup a."
"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,","Chun, nuhmei pakhat kum sâwmpahni thipûtin a damnawh a, a sum nei po po dâktawrhai kuomah a sukthâm zo ta sih a, tukhawmin an sukdam thei ta si nawh a;"
"came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.","ama chu a hnungah a hung a, a puon hmawr a them a, kârloin a thipût chu a bo nghâl tah a."
"And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush thee.","Chun, Isûn, “A mi them kha tu am a na?” a ta. Chun, “Kei chu ka ni nawh,” an ti seng a. Peter le a ruolhaiin, “Inchûktirtu, mipuihaiin an hneng sup sup cheh a, an bûm tul tul che annâwm,” an ta."
"But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.","Nisienlakhawm, “Tûin amanih chu a mi them a nih, thilthawtheina ka sûnga inthawkin a suok nghe nghe ti ka hriet a nih,” a ta."
"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.","Chun, nuhmei chun ân thup thei naw a hriet a, inthin pumin a hung a, a hmaah a bawkkhup a, a them san le kârloa a dam tâk elzie chu mi po po hmua chun a hril tah a."
"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ka naunu, i ringna hi i dampui a nih, thlamuongtakin fe rawh,” a ta."
"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.","A la ṭawng zing laiin in- khâwmna in hotu ina inthawk chu mi pakhat a hung a, “I naunu a thi tah, inchûktirtu suksâwl nuom naw,” a ta."
"But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.","Isu ruok chun chu thu chu a hriet chun, “Ṭi naw rawh, ring el rawh, chuongchun, dam nâwk a tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.","Chun, in chu a va tlung chun, Peter hai, Jakob hai, Johan hai, naupang nu le pa chau naw chu tukhawm lût a phal ve nawh a."
"And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.","Chun, an rêngin an lo ṭap rak rak a, an âwm an inchum a; chuongchun, ama chun, “Ṭap naw ro, a thi nawh, a in innghil a ni lem,” a ta."
"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.","Chun, a thi tain an hriet zing sih a, an nuisan el a."
"But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.","Isu ruok chun a kut a chel a, “Bawinu, tho rawh,” a ta, a ko a."
"And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that something be given her to eat.","Chun, a thlarau chu a hung kîr nâwk a, a tho nghâl tah a; chun, iengkhat fâk ding pêk ding thu a pêk a."
And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.,"Chun, a nu le pa chun mak an ti hleh a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun, a thilthaw chu tukhawm hril lo dingin a ti tlat a."
"And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.","Chun, Isûn sâwm le pahnihai chu a ko khâwm a, khawhri po po chunga thilthawtheina le thuneina le natnahai sukdam theina a pêk a."
"And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.","Chuongchun, Pathien ram thu hril ding le, damnawhai sukdam dingin a tir suok tah a."
"And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.","Chun, an kuomah, “Inzinnaa dingin hmawl amanih, mansa ama- nih, bei amanih, tangka amanih, iengkhawm chawi naw ro; zakuo pahni khawm nei naw ro."
"And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.","Chun, in tlungna in taphawtah tlung zing pei unla, chu ina inthawk chun suok ro."
"And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","Chun, a lâwm naw taphawt cheu chu, chu khuoa inthawka in suok pha chun an thiemnawzie inhriettirna dingin in kephaa pilvut chu thin thla ro,” a ta."
"And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.","Chuongchun, an fe tah a, khuo an fang pei a, ram tinah Chanchin Ṭha an hril a, mi an sukdam pei a."
"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;","Chun, lal Herod chun a thilthaw po po chu a lo hrietin a lunginzîng tah a, ṭhenkhatin, “Johan kha a hring nâwk tah a ni hi,” an ta,"
"and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.","ṭhenkhatin, “Elija a hung inlâr tah a ni hi,” an ta, ṭhenkhatin, “Tienlaia zâwlnei tû amanih a tho nâwk tah a ni hi,” an ti leiin."
"And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.","Chun, Herod chun, “Johan lu chu ka tan ta kha; nisienlakhawm, hieng ang lâwma a thu ka ihriet hlak hi tû am a na?” a ta. Chun, ama chun hmu a tum tah a."
"And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.","Chun, tirkohai chu an hung nâwkin, a kuomah an thilthawhai an hril a. Chun, ama chu anni atuma ṭhuoiin Bethsaida an ti khuoa chun a fe tah a."
"But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun an hriet a, an zui pei a; chun, ama chun anni chu a lo lâwm a, Pathien ram thu a hril a, sukdam ngaihai chu a sukdam a."
"And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu ding a ni tah a, sâwm le pahnihai chu an hung a, a kuomah, “Ei kâwl vêl khuoahai le loahai fea, tlung in le fâk ding an hmu theina dingin mipui hi infetir ta la; hi, thlalêr hmuna um ei ni sih a,” an ta."
"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn fâk ding pe ro,” a ta. Anni chun, “Hieng mi po po ta ding hin fâk ding kan vân châwkpêk naw chun, beiphêk panga le nga pahni chau naw chu iengkhawm kan nei nawh,” an ta."
"For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.","(Patling ruok khawm sâng nga lai rau an ni sih a). Chun, a închûktirhai kuomah, “Apâwl peiin inṭhungtir ro, sâwmnga lai peiin,” a ta."
"And they did so, and made them all sit down.","Chuong ang chun an thawh a, an inṭhungtir ta vawng a."
"And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.","Chun, beiphêk panga le nga pahni chu a lâk a, vân tieng enin mal a sâwm a, a khawi a, mipui hmaa sem dingin a inchûktirhai kuoma chun a pêk a."
"And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.","Chun, an fâk a, an khawp ta vawng a; an fâk mahla nawi chu bâwm sâwm le pahni an rût sip a."
"And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?","Chun, Isûn a khât chaua a ṭawngṭai laiin, a închûktirhai chu a kuomah an um a, an kuomah, “Mipuihaiin tu am a nih an mi tih a?” tiin ân dawn a."
"And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.","Chun, anni chun, “ ‘Baptistu Johan,’ an ti cheh a, nisienlakhawm, ṭhenkhatin, ‘Elija,’ ṭhenkhatin, ‘Tien- lai zâwlnei tû amanih a tho nâwk tah a nih,’ an ti che,” tiin an dawn a."
"And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Anleh, nangnîn tû am a nih in mi tih a?” a ta. Chun Peterin, “Pathien Krista chu,” tiin a dawn a."
"But he charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no man;","Chun, chu thu chu tukhawm hril lo ding ti tlatin, thu a pêk a."
"saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.","“Mihriem Naupa hin thil tamtak a tuor ding a na, upahai, thiempu lalhai, Dân Inchûktirtuhai dit nawin a um ding a na, thatin a um ding a na, ni thum niah keithoin a um bawk ding a nih,” a ta."
"And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.","Chun, ama bawkin mi po po kuomah, “Tûkhawmin mi zui a nuom chun mâni inhnâwlin, ni tin a kraws putin mi zui raw se."
"For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.","Tûkhawm a nun humhim nuom phawt chun chân a ta; tûkhawm keia leia nun chân taphawt chun, ama ngei chun humhim a tih."
"For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?","Mîn khawvêl hi a pumin nei sienla, insukboin amanih insukse sienla, a ta dingin iengam ṭhahnem a ta?"
"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.","Tûkhawm kei le ka thu inzapui taphawt chu, Mihriem Naupa hin ama ropuina leh, a Pa ropuina leh, a vântirko inthienghai ropuina leh a hung pha chun ama chu hung inzapui vêng a tih."
"But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.","Indiktakin ka hril cheu hi, hitaka ngîrhai a ṭhen hi Pathien ram an hmu hmakhat chun thina intem tawp lo ding an um,” a ta."
"And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.","Chun, chuong thu a hrila inthawk ni riet amanih lai hnunga chun, Isûn Peter hai, Johan hai, Jakob hai chu a ṭhuoi a, ṭawngṭai dingin tlângah a hang feh a."
"And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling.","Chun, a ṭawngṭai laiin a hmêl umzie chu a hung danglam a, a silfênhai chu a hung vâr a, mi elkhal theiin a um tah a."
"And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;","Chun, ngai ta, mi pahni ama leh an inbiek a, chuhai chu Mosie le Elija an nih;"
"who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.","ropuinaa inthuomin an inlâr a, Jerusalem khuoa a thi tleitlâkna ding thu an hril a."
"Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.","Peter le a ruolhai ruok chu an inlusuh a; chun, an har phingleh a ropuizie le a kâwla mi pahni ngîr chu an hmu tah a."
"And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.","Chun, anni chun Isu an mâksan ding laiin, Peterin Isu kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, ei ta dingin hitaka um zing hi a ṭha; bâwkte pathum khâwng kan tih, i ta dingin pakhat, Elija ta dingin pakhat, Mosie ta dingin pakhat,” a ta, a thu hril khawm hre loin."
"And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin sûm a hung zîng a, anni a hlie tah a; sûma chun an lût laiin an ṭih a."
"And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.","Chun, sûma chun râwl a hung suok a, “Hi hi ka Naupa, ka ithlang chu a nih, ama thu ngai ro,” a ta."
"And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.","Chun, râwl chu a bo phingleh Isu chu ama chauin an hmu tah a. Chun, an to zing a, chuong lai vêl chun an thil hmu chu tukhawm an hril nawh."
"And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.","Chun, a zîngah tlânga inthawka an ṭum hnung chun, mipui nasatakin ama chu an lo tuok a."
"And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:","Chun, ngai ta, mipui lai chun, mi pakhat a khêk a, “Inchûktirtu, ka naupa hi en dingin ka ngên che, ka nau nei sun a ni sih a."
"and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.","Ngai ta, khawhriin a man hlak a, a khêk suok thut hlak, chuong- chun, a chilhuom tla khawpin a sawisa hlak a, nasataka sukhliemin a mâksan ṭâwk hlak."
And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.,"Chun, i închûktirhai kuomah hnawt dawk dingin ka ngên a, an thei si nawh a,” a ta."
"And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.","Chun, Isûn “Ruolthar ringna nei loa kâwmawhai, ieng chen am in kuomah um ka ta, ngaithei ka ti cheu a? I naupa chu hitaka hin hung ṭhuoi rawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare him grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.","Chun, a hung laiin, khawhri chun a sukthlûk rak a, nasatakin a sawisa tah a. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn khawhri inthieng naw chu a hal a, naupang chu a sukdam a, a pa kuoma chun ân fetir nâwk tah a."
"And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,","Chun, mi po poin Pathien ropuizie chu mak an ti hleh a. Chuongchun, mi po po chun a thilthaw po po chu mak an ti lai chun, Isûn a închûktirhai kuoma chun,"
Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.,"“Chuong thu chu in naah lût raw se, Mihriem Naupa hi mihriem- hai kuta inmantirin a um ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
"But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.","Nisienlakhawm, a thu hril chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a, an hriet thei nawna dingin ân thup a nih, chu thu hril chanchin chu ama hlak an indawn ngam si nawh a."
"And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.","Chun, “Eini lai tu am ropui tak a ta?” tiin an lo insêl a."
"But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,","Chuongchun, Isûn an lungrila an ngaituo chu a hriet a, naupangte a kei a, a sîrah ân ngirtir a,"
"and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.","an kuomah, “Tûkhawm, ka hming leia hi naupangte lâwm taphawt chu kei a mi lâwm ning a ta, tukhawm kei mi lâwm chu a mi tirtu lâwm nîng a tih, nangni laia chîntak hi a nih a ropui chu,” a ta."
"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.","Chun, Johan chun, “Inchûktir- tu, tu amanih i hminga khawhrihai hnawt dawk kan hmuh a, kan zuina cheah a ṭhang ve naw leiin kan khap el annaw,” a ta, a dawn a."
"But Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.","Isu ruok chun a kuomah, “Khap ta naw ro, tûkhawm nangni sêlkal naw chu in tienga ṭhang a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,","Chun, ama vâna ṭhuoi a hun ding laiin, Jerusalema fe tumin a ngha tlat a,"
"and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.","a hmaah thangkohai ân tlântir a, chun, an feh a, ama lo buotsaipêk dingin Samari khuo pakhatah an lût a."
"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem.","Chun, a mitmei chu Jerusalem tieng pana ân lang leiin ama an lâwm nawh."
"And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?","Chuongchun, a închûktir Jakob le Johan chun chu chu an hriet phingleh, “Lalpa, hienghai kâng vawngna ding hi vâna inthawkin mei ko thla inlang rem i ti?” an ta."
"But he turned, and rebuked them.","Ama ruok chu a hang nghah a, a baukhat a."
And they went to another village.,"Chun, khaw dangah an fe tah a."
"And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.","Chun, lampuia an fe laiin tuin amanih a kuomah, “I fena taphawtah zui ka ti che,” a ta."
"And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","Isûn a kuomah, “Sihalhaiin kuo an nei a, chunga vatehai khawmin bu an nei a, Mihriem Naupa ruok hin chu a lu innghatna a nei nawh,” a ta."
"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.","Chun, Isûn mi dang kuomah, “Mi zui rawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Lalpa, ka pa mîn vuitir zet rawh,” a ta."
"But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.","Isu ruok chun a kuomah, “Mithiin anni mithi chu vui raw se; nang chun Pathien ram thu va hril dar lem rawh,” a ta."
"And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.","Chun, mi dang khawmin, “Lalpa, zui ka ti che, amiruokchu, ka ina mihai bau ṭhain mîn thlatir zet rawh,” a ta."
"But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.","Isûn a kuomah, “Tukhawm hnuoi inletnaa kut innghata, hnung tieng ngha chu Pathien rama mi ni tlâk a ni nawh,” a ta."
