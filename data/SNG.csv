"The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.","Hlahai hla, Solomon ta chu."
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine.,A baua fâwpnahai chun mi hung fâwp sien; I hmangaina chu uoin nêk chun a ṭha lem sih a.
Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee.,"I hriekhai chun rim inhnikna tak a nei a; I hming chu hriek bun suok ang a nih; Chuleichun, nunghâkhaiin an hmangai che a nih."
Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee.,"Mi hîp la, i hnungah hung tlân kan tih: Lal chun a pindanhaia chun a mi ṭhuoi a; Nangmaa chun hlimin lâwm kan tih; Uoin nêk chun i hming chu hung hril lem kan ta; An hmangai takzet che a nih."
"I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.","Ka hâng a, nisienlakhawm, ngaino ka bei, Aw nangni Jerusalem naunuhai, Kedar puon inhai ang le, Solomon puonzârhai ang el chun."
"Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother’s sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept.","Ka hâng êm leiin kei mîn sit naw unla, Nisa chun a mi em duk leiin. Ka nu naupasalhai chu ka chungah an lunginsen a, Grêp huon enkawltuah an mi siem a; Keima grêp huon ruok chu ka enkawl nawh."
"Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou makest it to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions?","Aw nang ka thlain a ihmangai, mi hril rawh, I ran ruol chu khâwlai am în tlattir a, sûn huna chun khâwlai am în châwltirna; I pâwlhai ran ruol sîra chun, Iengdinga invâk invâk ding am ka na?

"If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.","Aw nang nuhmeihai laia hmêlṭha tak, i hriet naw a ni chun, Ran ruolhai kehnunga chun i lampui chu zui suok la, I kêltehai chu berâmpu puon in kâwla chun intlattir rawh."
"I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.","Aw ka hmangai, Pharao sakawr tawlailîra, Sakawr lâ le chun ka hrilkhi cheh a."
"Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, Thy neck with strings of jewels.","I bienghai chu samphier le chun ngaino an bei hle a, I rînga lunghlu ṭhihruihai le chun."
We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.,"Rângkachak ṭhi hrui, Tangkaraw sûngphûm nei siempêk kan ti che. Nunghâk"
"While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.","Lal chu a ṭhungnaa a ṭhung lai chun, Ka spiknard chun a riminhnik a tirsuok a."
"My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts.","Ka hmangaitak chu ka ta ding chun murra bâwm ang a na, Ka âwmhai inkâra um ang hi."
My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi.,"Ka hmangaitak chu ka ta dingin henna pârbâwr, En-gedi grêp huona ang chu a nih. Tlangvâl"
"Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves.","Ngai ta, ka hmangai, i hmêl a ṭha, ngai ta, i hmêl a ṭha, I mithai chu vaṭhu mit ang a nih. Nunghâk"

"As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.","Hling laia lili ang hi A nih ka hmangaitak chu, nunghâkhai laia chun. Nunghâk"
"As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.","Ramhnuoi thinghai laia apple thing ang el A nih ka hmangaitak chu, tlangvâlhai laia chun. Inhawi titakin a hlima chun ka ṭhung a, A ra chu ka baua chun a thlum a nih."
"He brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me was love.","Bu fâkna ina chun a mi ṭhuoi a, Ka chunga a puonzâr chu hmangaina a nih."
"Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am sick from love.",Grêp ra ṭâwl bâwrhai le chun mîn umtir la Apple chun mi sukhlim rawh. Hmangainain ka na sih a.
"His left hand is under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me.","A kut vawitieng chu ka lu hnuoiah a um a, A kut changtieng chun a mi kuoh a."
"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Until he please.","Aw Jerusalem naunuhai, ka ngên cheu, Phûla sazukpuihai le sakhihaiin, Ka hmangai chu sukṭhangin suktho naw ro, Ama a nuom hmakhat chun."
"The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills.","Ka hmangaitak râwl chu, ngai ta, a hung ie, Tlânghai chunga hung inchâwmin, muolhai chunga hung inhnelin."
"My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He looketh in at the windows; He glanceth through the lattice.","Ka hmangaitak chu sakhi amanih, sazuk la amanih ang a na, Ngai ta, ei bang phênah a ngîr zing. A hung bi khu tukvera chun, Zâwngdaikal âwngah ân lang."
"My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.","Ka hmangaitak chun a hril a, ka kuomah, Tlangvâl “Ka hmangai, ka enchimlo, tho la, hung rawh."
"For, lo, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone;","En ta, phalbi a liem tah a, Raw sûr khawm ân khêl tah a, a fe liem tah;"
"The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing of birds is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;","Hnuoi chunga chun pârhai an hung inlang a, Vatehai hlasak hun a hung tlung tah a, Ei ramah vaṭhu râwl chu hriet a ni tah."
"The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.","Theichang thinghai chun ra a hung insuo a; Grêp hruihai khawm chu a kumûm tah a, An riminhnik chu an tirsuok a, Tho la, ka hmangai, ka hmêlṭha, hung rawh,” tiin."
"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see thy countenance, Let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.","Aw ka vaṭhu, lungpui kawi kârahai chun chêng a, Ṭênbaram kuokârhaia um, I hmêl mîn hmutir la, i râwl mîn hriettir rawh; I râwl chu ân nêm a, i hmêl hlak ngaino a bei sih a."
"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.","Sihalhai, sihal chînhai chu mi manpêk la, Grêp huon suksetuhai chu, Ei grêp huon chu a pâr lai tak a ni sih a."
"My beloved is mine, and I am his: He feedeth his flock among the lilies.","Ka hmangaitak chu ka ta a na, kei khawm a ta ka nih; Ama chun a ran ruol chu lilihai lai chun ân tlattir hlak."
"Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart Upon the mountains of Bether.","Sûnni chu a hung dei a, hlimhai chu a fe hmang chenin, Ka hmangaitak, kîr la, sakhi amanih, Sazuk lâ amanih ang ni rawh, Bether tlâng chunga chun."
"By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.","Zânah ka khum chungah ka thlain a hmangai chu ka zawng a, Ama chu ka zawng a, anachu ka hmu nawh a."
"I said, I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.","“Tuhin tho ka ta, khawpui chu fang vêl ka ta, Kawtthlêrhaia le lamlienhaia chun, Ka thlain a hmangai chu zawng ka tih” ka tih a.

"It was but a little that I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mother’s house, And into the chamber of her that conceived me.","Anni ka fe khêl hnung sâwt nawtêah, Ka thlain a hmangai chu ka hmuh a.

"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant?","Meikhu intung lui lui anga Thlalêra inthawka hung suok a, Dâwrkai paudâr po po le, Beraw le murraa innâl riminhnik hi tu am a na?"
"Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty men of Israel.","En ta, a khum hi, Solomon ta hi, Mi thilthawtheitak sâwmrukin an inhuol a, Israel mi hrât khawkhênghai chun."
"They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: Every man hath his sword upon his thigh, Because of fear in the night.","Kâwlhnâm an chawi seng a, indonaa thiemsa an nih; Mi tin chun an kâwlhnâm chu an êlpui chungah an pai seng a, Zâna ṭitna lei chun."
King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon.,"Lal Solomon chun inzâwnna khum a siem a, Lebanon thingin."
"He made the pillars thereof of silver, The bottom thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple, The midst thereof being paved with love, From the daughters of Jerusalem.","A banhai chu tangkaruoin a siem a, A ṭuong rângkachakin, a ṭhungna a dumpâwlin, A sûngril tieng chu hmangaina le rem a na, Jerusalem nauhaiin."
"Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon, With the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.","Aw nangni Zion naunuhai, fe suok unla, lal Solomon chu en ro, Nuhmei a nei nia le a lungril a hlim nia a nuin lallukhum ân khumtir kha."
"Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead.","Ngai ta, i hmêl a ṭha, ka hmangai, i hmêl a ṭha, ngai ta, I mithai chu i puon lukhum hnuoia chun vaṭhu mit ang a na, I sam chu kêl ruol ang a nih; Gilead tlâng pang sira bawkhai ang chu."
"Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.","I hahai chu berâmpui hmul vaw zo hlim, Tui insilnaa inthawka hung suokhai ang chu an nih. A kawp kawpin an um seng a, Anni lai a tu khawm a khâtin a um nawh."
"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.","I hmûrhai chu sâpsen zai ang a na, I ṭawngbausuokhai chu ngaino a bei a; I barêphai chu theibufai hlek ang a na, I puon lukhum hnuoia chun."
"Thy neck is like the tower of David Builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men.","I rîng chu Davidin râlthuom siena dinga a bâwl in insâng ang chu a nih, Chutaka chun âwmphaw sâng khat an khai a, Mi hrât khawkhênghai phawhai po po chu."
"Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.","I nêne pahnihai chu sakhi tuoi a ṭhienga, Lili laia tla hmunkhat ang chu an nih."
"Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.","Sûn ni chu a hung dei a, hlimhai chu a fe hmang chenin, Murra tlânga le, Beraw muola chun fêng ka tih."
"Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.","Ka hmangai, i ṭha kimvêl vawng el, Nangmaa chun kaidum hrim a um nawh."
"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions’ dens, From the mountains of the leopards.","Lebanona inthawkin mi hung zui la, ka mo, Lebanona inthawkin kei leh. Amana sîpa inthawk chun zuk en la, Senir le Hermon sîpa inthawk dâm chun, Sakeibaknei pûka inthawk dâm le Keitêhai tlânga inthawk dâm chun."
"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.","Ka lungril chu i hne tah, ka farnu, ka mo, I mit sîr vawikhat mi âtna le, I rînga khaidiet pakhat chun ka lungril chu i sukhuoi tah."
"How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!","I hmangaina chu a vân hawi ngei, ka farnu, ka mo! I hmangaina chu uoin nêkin a va ṭha lem nasa de! Riminhnik chi po pohai nêkin i hriek rim chu a vân hnik ngei!"
"Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.","I hmûrhai chu, aw ka mo, khuoizu bâwm angin a far a, I lei hnuoia chun khuoizu le nênetui a um a; I silfênhai rim chu Lebanon rim ang a nih."
"A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.","Huon khâra um chu ka farnu, ka mo a na, Tuihnâr inhuona um le, tuikhur khâra um le chun."
"Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,","I thil phunhai chu theibufai, ra hlutakhai chu a na, Henna le spiknard thinghai leh."
"Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.","Spiknard le pâr riminhnik, Dipâr le thingzungthak, Beraw thing chi po po leh; Murra le Aloes, rim inhniktak chi po po leh."
"Thou art a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.","Nang chu huona tuikhur, tuisunsuo hnâr nei le, Lebanona vadungtê luonghai i nih. Nunghâk"
"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.","Tho la, aw hmâr thli, nang sim thli, hung rawh; Ka huon chungah hung hrâng la, riminhnikhai chu a fe suok theina dingin. Ka hmangaitak chu a huonah hung sienla, A theira hlutakhai chu hung fa raw se. Tlangvâl"
"I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.","Ka farnu, ka huona chun ka hung ie, ka mo, Ka riminhnik leh ka murra chu ka lâk khâwm a; Ka khuoizu le ka khuoithlâr chu ka fâk a; Ka bâwng nênetui leh ka uoin chu ka dâwn tah. Nunghâk Aw ruolhai, fa ta u, Dâwn unla, dâwn ṭeu ro aw hmangaitak."
"I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.","Ka lo in a, ka lung ruok chu a har a, Chu! ka hmangaitak chu a hung nâwk ie, Tlangvâl “Mi hung hawngpêk rawh, ka farnu, ka hmangai, ka vaṭhu, ka ṭha famkim; Ka lu chu daidâwin a sukhu a, Ka sam chu zân hnâwngin,” tiin.

I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?,"Ka zakawchung chu ka hlîp tah a, iengtin am hâk nâwk ka ta? Ka kehai chu ka sâwp tah a, iengtin am sukbal nâwk ka ta?"
"My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, And my heart was moved for him.","Ka hmangaitak chun kawtkhâr âwnga chun a kut a hung pur a, Chun, ama ta dingin ka lungril chu a hung châng tah a."
"I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt.","Ka hmangaitak chu hawngpêk dingin ka tho tah a, Ka kuthai chu murrain a far a, ka kutpârhai chu murra tuiin, Kawtkalna bâwk chunga chun."
"I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.","Ka hmangaitak chu ka hawngpêk a; Nisienlakhawm, ka hmangai- tak chu a lo intâwlhmang a, a lo fe hmang tah a, Thu a hung hril lai khan ka thlain a mîn âwimâwtir a; Ama chu ka zawng a, anachu ka hmu nawh a; Ama chu ka ko a, anachu a mi dawn nawh."
"The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.","Vêngtuhai khawpuia fe vêlhai chun an mi hmuh a, An mi vuok a, an mi sukhliem a; Kul vêngtuhai chun ka puon lukhum an mi lâkpêk a."
"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.","Aw Jerusalem naunuhai, ka ngên cheu, ka hmangaitak kha in hmu chun, Hmangainain ka na a nih, ti ama chu hril ro."
"What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thou dost so adjure us?","I hmangaitak chu mi danghai hmangaitakhai leh a chuong a liemna, Aw nang nuhmeihai laia hmêlṭhatak, ieng am a um bîk a?

"My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.","Ka hmangaitak chu a ngo sen sier a, Sâng sâwm laia chun a ṭha tak a nih."
"His head is as the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, and black as a raven.","A lu chu rângkachak inthiengtak ang a na, A samtawm chu ân bukin, vaâk angin a dum a."
"His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, and fitly set.","A mithai chu vadungtê tui kâwla vaṭhu mithai ang a na, Nênetuia sâwp, inremtaka inbûk."
"His cheeks are as a bed of spices, As banks of sweet herbs: His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.","A bienghai chu riminhnik bil, rim inhnik insuo hlak ang a na, A hmûrhai chu lili, murra tui infartir ang chu a nih."
His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl: His body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires.,"A kuthai chu rângkachak tluon, berul lung phûm ang chu an na, A taksa chu saihaa siem, Sapphir lunga tuom ang a nih."
"His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.","A kehai chu sailungvâr banhai, rângkachak inbûkna kuoa inbûk ang a na. A hmêl inlang dân chu Lebanon, sidar thinga ṭha bîk rieu ang chu a nih."

"Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee?","Khâw tieng am i hmangaitak chu a fe tah a, Aw nang nuhmei laia hmêlṭha tak? I hmangaitak chu khâwtieng am ân her tah a, Nang leh ama chu kan zawngpui theina ding chein?"
"My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.","Ka hmangaitak chu a huonah, riminhnikhai bila chun a feh a, Huona chun vân suktlai ding le, lilihai va la khâwm dingin."
"I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth his flock among the lilies.","Ka hmangaitak ta chu ka na, ka hmangaitak chu ka ta a nih, An ran ruolhai chu lili lai chun ân tlattir a."
"Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.","Aw ka hmangai, Tirza angin i mawi a, Jerusalem angin ngaino i bei a; Puonzâr le sipai ruol angin ṭi i um bawk a."
"Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead.","Keimaa inthawkin i mithai chu la kieng rawh, An mi sukṭi ta sih a. I sam chu kêl ruol, Gilead sîr panga tlahai ang chu a nih."

Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.,"I barêphai chu theibufai hlek ang a na, I puon lukhum hnuoia chun."
"There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number.","Lalnu sâwmruk le, thaikêm chu sâwmriet an um a, Chun, nunghâk chu tiem sêng lo."
"My dove, my undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.","Ka vaṭhu, ka ṭha famkim chu, pakhat chau a nih; Ama chu a nu nau nei sun a na, Ama châwitu nu lunglam tak chu a nih.

"I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, And the pomegranates were in flower.","Makha huona chun ka zu fe thlah a, Phai ruoma thil phun hringhai chu en ding le, Grêp hruihai chu an inder ta am, Theibufaihai chu an pâr ta am ti en dingin."

"Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?","Kîr rawh, kîr rawh, aw Shulam mi, Kîr rawh, kîr rawh, kan en theina ding chein; Nunghâk Mahanaim lâm en ang el chun, Iengdingin am Shulam mi chu en i ta?

Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe.,"I nênehai chu sakhite pahni, Sakhipui tê ṭhienghai ang chu a nih."
"Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus.","I rîng chu saiha in insâng ang a na, I mithai chu Bath-rabbim dai kawtkhâr bula, Hesbona dîlhai ang chu a nih; I hnâr chu Lebanona in insâng, Damaska tienga ngha ang chu a nih."
"Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.","I lu chu i chunga chun Karmel ang a na, I lua sam chu a sen êm hieu a, I samtlai ṭhatzie hi lalin a tuor zo nawh."
"How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!","Aw hmangai, lâwm i umin, I hmêl a ṭhain, lung i sukâwi ngei de aw!"
"This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to its clusters.","I dung insângzie hi intûm thing ang i na, I nênehai chu grep ra bâwr ang."
"I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy breath like apples,","“Intûm thinga hin hang lâwn ka ta, Chutaka a kauhai chu chel ka tih,” ka tih a. I nênehai chu grêp hrui bâwr ang chu ni sienla, I thuok rim chu apple rim ang ni raw se. Nunghâk"
"And thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.","Chun, i bau chu uoin ṭhatak, Ka hmangaitak ta dinga luong thla ziei ziei a, Mi a inhai hmûra luong lût pei ang chu a nih."
I am my beloved’s; And his desire is toward me.,"Ka hmangaitak ta chu ka na, Chun, a châk zâwng khawm keia tieng a nih."
"Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.","Hung rawh, ka hmangaitak, phûlah fe suok ei ta, Khuoahai khin riek ei tih."
"Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, And its blossom is open, And the pomegranates are in flower: There will I give thee my love.","Grêp huonahai chun zîngkâr fêng ei ta, Grêphruihai chu a kumûm tahin, a pârhai chu a pâr ta am, Theibufaihai khawm chu a pâr ta am ti en ei tih; Chutaka chun ka hmangaina chu pêng ka ti che."
"The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.","Zâwldiai chun a riminhnik a suksuok a, Chun, ei kawtkhâr bula chun theira hlutaktakhai chi tinrêng, A hlui le a thar a um ṭeu a, Chuong chu i ta dinga ka siekhâwl a nih, aw ka hmangaitak."
"Oh that thou wert as my brother, That sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; Yea, and none would despise me.","Aw nang chu ka ṭapa, Ka nu nênehai netu ngei ni la chu aw! Tuola ka hmu che khawmin, fâwp ka ti che; Anih, tukhawma mîn zâpui naw nih."
"I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house, Who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.","Ṭhuoi ka ti cheh a, ka nu– Mi lo inchûktirtu ding ina chun ṭhuoi ka ti che, Uoin rim inhnik indâwntir ka ti cheh a, Ka theibufai tui chu."
"His left hand should be under my head, And his right hand should embrace me.","A kut vawitieng chu ka lu hnuoiah siein, Chun, a kut changtieng chun kei mi hang kuo sien chu aw!"
"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Until he please.","Aw Jerusalem naunuhai, ka ngên cheu hi, Ka hmangai chu sukṭhang naw unla, suktho bawk naw ro, a nuom hmakhat chu."
"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple-tree I awakened thee: There thy mother was in travail with thee, There was she in travail that brought thee forth.","Thlalêra inthawka a hmangaitak ringsana Hungnu saw tu am a na? Nunghâk Apple thing hnuoia chun ka keiṭhang cheh a, Chutaka chun i nu chu nanga leia nauhase nat chun a um a, Chutaka chun nanga neitu che chu nauhase nat tuorin a um tah."
"Set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm: For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol; The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, A very flame of Jehovah.","I lungril chunga chun inchikna ang le, I bân chunga chun inchikna angin mi sie la; Hmangaina chu thina ang elin a hrât sih a; Itthîkna chu thlân ang ela rilo a na; A chawkhai chu meichawk a na, LALPA meichawkhai ngei chu."
"Many waters cannot quench love, Neither can floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, He would utterly be contemned.","Tui tamtakin hmangaina chu a sukre thei nawh a, Tuilien khawmin a chîm hmang thei nawh. Miin a ina thuomhnaw po po chu hmangaina ta dingin pe sien khawm, Hmusit let dêr nîng a tih. Nunghâk ṭahai"
"We have a little sister, And she hath no breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she shall be spoken for?","Farnu chitê kan nei a, Ama chun nênehai a nei nawh a; Ei farnu ta ding chun ieng am thaw tâng ei ta, Ama chanchin chu hrila a um nia chun?"
"If she be a wall, We will build upon her a turret of silver: And if she be a door, We will inclose her with boards of cedar.","Ama chu kul ni sienla chu, Tangkaraw in ropui a chungah bâwl ei ta; Ama chu kawtkhâr ni ta sienla, Ama chu sidar thingphêkhaiin sukbit ei tih. Nunghâk"
"I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof: Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.","Kei chu kul bang ang ka na, Ka nênehai chu chutaka in insâng ang; Chun, ama mithmua chun mi inremna hmutu ang chu ka nih. Tlangvâl"
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard unto keepers; Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.,"Solomon chun Baal-hamona chun grêp huon a nei a, Grêp huon chu a enkawltuhai kuomah ân umtir a; Mi tinin chutaka theira man ding chun tangka sâng khat an hung lâk hlak ding a nih."
"My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand, And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.","Ka grêp huon, ka ta chu, ka hmaa chun a um a; Nang aw Solomon, sâng khat chu nei i tih; Chun, chutaka a theira vêngtuhai chun za hnih."
