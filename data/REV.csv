"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unto his servants, even the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John;","Isu Krista thuphuongsuo, Pathienin a suokhai inhriettir dinga a kuoma a pêk, thil hung um vak ding thu chu; chu chu a vântirko hmangin a suok Johan kuomah a hung inhriettir a;"
"who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, even of all things that he saw.","chu Johan chun, Pathien thu le Isu Krista inhriettirna thu, a thil hmu po pohai chu ân hriettir a."
"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the time is at hand.",Hi hrillâwkna bu thu tiemtu le ngaia a sûnga thu ziek pawmtuhai chu an hamṭha; a hun chu a hnai ta sih a.
"John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne;","Johan chun: Asia rama kohran pasarihai kuoma chun: Um zing le um ta le hung um ding kuoma inthawk dâm, a lalṭhungpha hmaa thlarau pasari umhai kuoma inthawk dâm,"
"and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood;","Isu Krista, thu hretu ringumtak, mithi laia inthawka tho hmasatak le hnuoia lalhai rorêltu kuoma inthawk dâm chun, lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se. A mi hmangai a, a thisenin ei suolhaia inthawkin a mîn tlan suok a,"
"and he made us to be a kingdom, to be priests unto his God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.","khuoletui le a Pathien le a Pa tienga thiempua mi siemtu kuomah, anih, ama kuom ngeiah, ropuina le rorêlna chu chatuonin um raw se! Amen."
"Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they that pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen.","Ngai ta u, ama chu sûmhai le chun a hung ding a nih; mit tinrêngin hmûng an ta, a suntuhai ngei khawm khan; khawvêla hnam po poin ama ṭa bawk an tih. Chuong angtak chun ning a tih, Amen."
"I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.","“Kei Alpha le Omega ka nih,” Lalpa Pathien um zing le um ta le hung um ding, Iengkimthawthei chun a ti a nih."
"I John, your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patience which are in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.","Kei Johan, in unaupa le, Isu rinumna dâm, khuoletui dâm, selna dâm inṭâwmpuitu cheu hi, Pathien thu lei le, Isu inhriettirna thu leiin Patmos thlierkâr an tia chun ka um a."
"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet","Lalpa nia chun Thlarauin ka lo um a; chun, ka hnung tiengah, tawtawrâwt ri ang, rawl inringtakin,"
"saying, What thou seest, write in a book and send it to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.","“I thil hmu ding chu lekhabuah ziek la, kohran pasarihai kuomah, Ephesia dâm, Smurnaa dâm, Pergamosa dâm, Thuatiraa dâm, Sardisa dâm, Philadelphiaa dâm, Laodikeia dâm chun thawn rawh,” a ti ka hriet a."
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;,"Chun, a mi biekna rawl chu hmu tumin ka hang nghale tah a. Ka hang nghale chun, rângkachak khâwnvar siena pasari ka hmuh a;"
"and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.","khâwnvar siena lai chun, mi tu amanih mihriem naupa ang, ke lêr chena puon sil, a âwma rângkachak kâwngkhia inkhit ka hmu bawk a."
"And his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;","A lu le a sam chu berâm hmul vâr angin a vâr a, vûr ang elin; a mithai chu meichawk ang a nih."
"and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.","A kephahai chu dâr tle mi ang a na, raw tuina meia raw thieng ta ang elin; a rawl chu tui tamtak ri ang el a nih."
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.,"A kut chang tieng chun arasi pasari a chawi a; a baua inthawk chun kâwlhnâm ngeituo ngeitak a suok a, a hmêl chu nisa sat vânglai tak ang a nih."
"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,","Ama chu ka hmu phingleh thi ang dêrin a ke bulah ka tlu tah a. Ama chun a kut changtieng chu ka chunga innghatin,ka kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh; kei Hmasatak le, Nu- hnungtak le,"
"and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.","Mi Hring chu ka nih, ka lo thi a, nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, kumkhuoa dingin ka hring nâwk ta a nih. Thina le Mithi Khaw chabihai chu ka nei bawk a."
"Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter;","“Chuongchun, i thil hmu tahai le thil um zinghai le tuta hnunga thil hung um dinghai thu chu ziek rawh;"
"the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.","ka kut changtienga arasi pasari um i hmuhai le, rângkachak khâwn- var siena pasarihai thurûk chu, Arasi pasari chu kohran pasarihai tirko an na, khâwnvar pasari chu kohran pasarihai chu an nih."
"And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;","Chun, vântirko hrâttak dang pakhat, sûma inthuom, vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka hmuh a; a lua chun sumrisâng ân zâm a, a hmai chu nisa ang a na, a kehai chu mei ban ang a nih."
"and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth;","A kuta chun lekhabu chîtê phawk sa a chawi a, a ke changtiengin tui- suoriet a sir a, a vawitiengin khaw- muol a sir a;"
"and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.",sakeibaknei inhûk angin rawl inringtakin a khêk tah a. A khêk zo chun vâninrûm pasarihai chun an rawl an insuo tah a.
"And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.","Chun, vâninrûm pasarihai chun an rawl an insuo phingleh ziek ka tum a; chuongchun, “Vâninrûm pasarihai thu hril chu ip tlat la ziek naw,” tiin vâna inthawkin rawl ka hriet a."
"And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,","Chun, vântirko tuisuoriet le khawmuola ngîr ka ihmu chun a kut chang tieng vân tieng a phar a,"
"and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there shall be delay no longer:","chatuona hring zing, vân, a chunga thil umhai le hnuoi, a chunga thil umhai le, tuisuoriet, a sûnga thil umhai le siemtu chu sâlin, “Hun um ta naw ni."
"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.","nisienlakhawm, vântirko pasari- na rawl ri a um phaleh, a mût ding ṭêpin, Pathien thurûk chu kim tâng a tih, a suok zâwlneihai kuoma a chanchin ṭha hril ang khan,” a tih a."
"And the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard it again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.","Chun, vâna inthawka rawl ka ihriet khan a mi biek nâwk a, “Tuisuoriet le khawmuola ngîr vân- tirko kuta lekhabu phar sa saw va la rawh,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.","Chun, vântirko kuoma chun ka va feh a, a kuomah, “Lekhabu chîtê kha mi pe rawh,” ka tih a. Ama chun ka kuomah, “La la, fa zo vawng rawh, chuongchun, i phîng chu sukkhâng a ta, i baua ruok chun khuoizu angin thlum a tih,” a ta."
"And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.","Chun, vântirko kuta inthawkin lekhabu chîtê chu ka lâk a, ka fâk zo vawng a; chuongchun, ka baua chun khuoizu angin a thlum a; nisien- lakhawm, ka fâk zo phingleh, ka phîng chu a kha zo tah a."
"And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.","Chun, ka kuomah, “Mi tamtak dâm, hnam tamtak dâm, ṭawng tam- tak dâm, lal tamtak dâm chungchâng thu hril nâwk i tih,” an tih a."
"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.","Chun, luong, hmawl ang hi pêkin ka um a, chuongchun, tûin amanih, “Tho la, Pathien biekin le mâichâm chu inkhi la, a sûnga betuhai khawm tiem rawh."
"And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.","Biekin puotienga inhuonna sûng tuollai ruok chu inkhi sa naw, chu chu Jentailhai kuoma pêk a ni ta sih a; anni chun khaw Inthieng chu thla sawmli pahni sir dêng an tih."
"And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.","Chun, ka thu hretu pahnihai kuoma chun thu pêng ka ta, chuongchun, saiip puon silin ni sâng khat za hni sâwmruk sûng po thu hril an tih,” a ta."
"These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.","Chuong chu Oliv thing pahni le khâwnvar siena pahni, khawvêl Lal hmaa ngîrhai chu an nih."
"And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed.","Anni chu tûkhawmin suknat an tum chun, an baua inthawkin mei a hung suok a, an hmêlmahai chu a kânghmang hlak. Tûkhawmin anni chu suknat tum ang sienla, chuong ang bawka sukhlumin an um ding a nih."
"These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.","Chuonghai chun an thu hril sûng po ruo sûr naw dinga vân sukping theina an nei a; an nuom pha phaa thisena inchangtir dingin tuihai chungah thu an nei a, khawvêl hi hremna tinrênga hrem dingin thu an nei bawk a."
"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.","Chun, an inhriettirna thu chu an hril zo phaa vânsama inthawka Sahrâng hung suok ding chun anni do a ta, hnêng a ta, sukhlum a tih."
"And their dead bodies lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.","Chun, an ruong chu khaw ropui kawtthlêra chun um zing a ta; chu khaw ropui chu thlarau tieng thua chu Sodom le Aigupta an ti a nih, chutaka bawk chun an Lalpa chu hemdein a um kha."
"And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do men look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.","Chun, mihai laia mi dâm, chihai laia mi dâm, ṭawnghai laia mi dâm, hnamhai laia mi dâmin ni thum le a chenve an ruong chu en an ta, an ruonghai chu thlâna phûm phal naw ni hai."
"And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth.","An thi leiin hnuoia umhai chu lâwm an ta, hlimna siem an ta, thilpêkhai inthawn tuo bawk an tih; zâwlnei pahni hai chun hnuoia umhai chu an sukrimsik hlak leiin."
"And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them.","Chun, ni thum le a chenve hnunga chun Pathien kuoma in- thawka hringna thuok an sûngah a hung lût a, an kein an ngîr tah a, chuongchun, a hmutuhai chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.","Chun, an kuomah, “Hitaka hin hung ro,” tiin vâna inthawkin rawl inringtak an hriet a. Chuongchun, sûm lai chun vânah an hang fe tah a; an hmêlmahai chun an hmu zing a."
"And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.","Chun, chu lai tak chun sim- khawleihnuoi nasatakin a hung inhnîng a, khuo chu hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat a chim tah a, simkhawleihnuoi inhnînga chun mi sâng sari an thih a; a danghai chun an ṭih a, vân Pathien chu an chawimawi tah a."
"The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.","Chungrikna pahnina chu a bo tah a, ngai ta, chungrikna pathumna chu a hung um vak ding a nih."
"And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.","Chun, vântirko pasarina chun a hang mût a, chuongchun, “Khawvêl ram chu ei Lalpa le a Krista ram a hung ni tah, ama chun chatuonin ro rêl a tih,” tiin vâna chun rawl inringtakin a hung suok nghâl tah a."
"And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,","Chuongchun, Pathien hmaa an lalṭhungphaa upa sâwmhni le pali ṭhunghai chu an bawkkhup a, Pathien chibai an bûk a."
"saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.","“Aw Lalpa Pathien, Iengkim- thawthei, um zing le um tah, i thilthawtheina ropuitak chu laa ro i rêl leiin lâwmthu kan hril che."
"And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and the time to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.","Hnamhai chu an lunginsen a, chun, i lunginsenna chu a hung tlung ve thung a, mithi rorêlpêk hun le, i suok zâwlneihai kuoma dâm, mi in- thienghai kuoma dâm, i hming inza mi lien le mi chînhai kuoma dâm, an lâwmman pêk hun le, hnuoi sukse- tuhai suksiet ve thung hun chu a hung tlung bawk a,” tiin."
"And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.","Chun, vâna Pathien biekin chu ân hawng a, chuongchun, biekina chun a thuthlungna bâwm chu a hung inlang tah a; chun kâwlinlep dâm, rawl dâm, vân inrûm dâm, simkhawleihnuoi inhnîng dâm, riel nasatak dâm, a hung um nghâl tah a."
"And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;","Chun, thilmak ropuitak vânah a hung inlang tah a; nuhmei nisaa inthuom, a ke hnuoia thla um, arasi sâwm le pahnia siem lallukhum khum a hung um a;"
"and she was with child; and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered.",ama chun nau a vawn a; nauhase nain ân rûm a.
"And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.","Chun, thilmak dang vânah a hung inlang nâwk a; ngai ta; drakon sen lientak lu sari le ki sâwm nei, lallukhum pasari khum a hung um a."
"And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child.","A mei chun vân arasi hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu a kei a, hnuoiah a peithlâk tah a. Chun, a nei phaa a nau chu a lem theina dingin drakon chu nuhmei nau nei ding hmaa chun a ngîr zing a."
"And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne.","Chun, naupasal, hnam po po chunga thîr hmawla rorêl ding a nei a, chun, a nau chu Pathien kuoma le a lalṭhungphaa chun zuk lâkin a um tah a."
"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.","Chun, nuhmei chu thlalêra Pathien ibuotsai hmun a neinaa chun a tlân hmang a, chutaka chun ni sâng khat za hni sâwmruk an châwm theina dingin."
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels;,"Chun, vâna chun indona a hung um a; Mikael le a vântirkohai chun drakon chu an do a;"
"and they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.","drakon le a tirkohai khawm chun an do ve a; nisienlakhawm, an hne ta nawh a, an hmun chu vânah a um ta bawk nawh."
"And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.","Chun, drakon lientak, Rûlpui tar, Diebol le Setan an ti, khawvêl po po hlêmtu chu, an pei thlâk tah a; hnuoiah an pei a, a tirkohai khawm an pei thlâk sa veh a."
"And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before our God day and night.","Chun, vâna chun rawl inring- takin, “Tuhin chu ei Pathien sandam- na le thilthawtheina le ram chu a hung tlung tah a, a Krista thuneina leh; ei unauhai hêktu, ei Pathien hmaa a sûn a zâna hêk hlaktu chu, an pei thlâk ta sih a."
"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.","Berâmte thisen lei le an in- hriettirna thu leiin, ama chu an hne a nih; thi ngam khawpin an hringna an ngainêp bawk a."
"Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.","Chuleiin, aw vânhai le a sûnga umhai, lâwm ro! Hnuoi le tuisuoriet, in chung a rik ie! Diebol chun hun tlâwmte chau a nei ti ân hriet leiin lunginsen bêk bêka in kuoma a hung thla ta leiin,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man child.","Chun, drakon chun hnuoia pei thlâk a nih ti ân hriet phingleh nau- pasal neitu nuhmei chu a suknawm- na tah a."
"And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.","Chuongchun, thlalêra a hmuna chun a vuong lût theina dingin nuhmei chu mupui lientak thla khing hni an pêk a, chutaka chun rûlpui hmu phâk nawah hun khat le hunhai le hun chenve sûng po châwm an tih."
"And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.","Chun, rûlpui chun tuiin a lên hmang theina dingin nuhmei hnunga chun vadung ang elin a baua tui a pik suok a."
"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.","Nisienlakhawm, hnuoiin nuhmei chu a ṭhangpui a, hnuoi chun a bau a kah a, drakonin abaua inthawka a pik suok vadung chu a lem zo tah a."
"And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus:","Chuongchun, drakon chu nu- hmei chunga chun a hung lunginsen a, a thla la um Pathien thupêkhai zâwm a, Isu inhriettirna thu pawm- hai chu do dingin a fe tah a."
"and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.","Chuongchun, tuisuoriet ṭieu- phoa chun a ngîr tah a. Chun, Sahrâng ki sâwm le lu sari nei, tuisuorieta hung suok ka hmuh a, a kihaia chun lallukhum sâwm a uma, a luhaia chun Pathien hrilsietna hminghai a um bawk a."
"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.","Chun, ka Sahrâng hmu chu keitê ang a na, a kehai chu savawm ke ang a nih; a bau chu sakeibaknei bau ang a nih; chun, drakon chun a kuomah a thilthawtheina le a lalṭhungpha le thuneina nasatak a pêk a."
And I saw one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast;,"A lu pakhat chu thipui khawp raua hliem angin ka hmuh a, nisien- lakhawm, thipui khawp rau dinga hliem chu a dam tah a; chuongchun, hnuoia mi po poin Sahrâng chu mak an tih a, an zui a."
"and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? and who is able to war with him?","Chun, Sahrâng kuoma chun a thuneina chu a pêk leiin drakon chu Pathien chibai bûkin an bûk a; chun, “Sahrâng ang hi tu am a uma, tuin am do thei a ta?” tiin Sahrâng khawm chu an bûk bawk a."
and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.,"Chun, uongna le Pathien hril- sietna thu hrilna bau a kuoma pêk a na, thla sâwmli pahni châng dingin thuneina pêk a ni bawk a."
"And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in the heaven.","Chuongchun, Pathien hrilsein a bau a ka tah a, a hming le a umna, vâna umhai chu hrilse dingin."
"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.","Chun, mi inthienghai a do le a hne phal a na, chi tinrêng dâm, mi tinrêng dâm, ṭawng tinrêng dâm, hnam tinrêng dâm chunga thuneina a kuoma pêk a ni bawk a."
"And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain.","Chuongchun, hnuoia um po po, leilung insieng tîra that tah Berâmtê Hringna Bua hming ziek naw po chun, Pathien chibai bûkin bûk an tih."
"If any man hath an ear, let him hear.",Tûkhawmin na a nei chun hre raw se.
"If any man is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.","Tûkhawm sala um ding ani chun salah a um hlak, tûkhawmin kâwlhnâma mi a that chun kâwl- hnâma that ding a nih. Hitaka hin mi inthienghai selna le ringna inlang theina a um."
"And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.","Chun, Sahrâng dang hnuoia hung suok ka hmuh a; berâmte kî ang ki pahni a nei a, drakon ṭawng angin a ṭawng a."
"And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.","Sahrâng hmasa thuneina po po ang kha a mithmuah a hmang a, Hnuoi le a chunga um po pohai chu Sahrâng hmasa lem, thipui khawp rau dinga hliem dam nâwk chu, chibai ân bûktir bawk a."
"And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.","Chun, mihriem mithmuah vâna inthawka hnuoia mei intlâktir thei khawp rauin thilmak ropuitak a thaw hlak."
"And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived.","Hnuoia umhai kuomah, Sa- hrâng kâwlhnâma hliem hnung la dam chawimawina dingin ama lim an siem ding a ni ti hrilin, Sahrâng mithmua thilmak thaw dinga thu a ihmu, chuong thilmak lei chun hnuoia umhai chu a hlêm bawk a."
"And it was given unto him to give breath to it, even to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.","Chun, Sahrâng lim chu a ṭawng theina ding le, Sahrâng lim chibai bûk naw taphawt ân sukhlumtir theina dingin Sahrâng lim kuoma chun inthuokna pêk phal a nih."
"And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;","Chun, mi po po a lien a chînin, a hausa a pasiein, suok le suok nawhai khawm, an kut chang tienga manih, an chala manih inchikna ân neitir tâwl a;"
"and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name.","inchikna, Sahrâng hming ama- nih, a hming nambar amanih, neihai chau naw chun, tûkhawmin ieng- khawm an inchâwkin an zawr thei nawna dingin."
"Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.",Hitaka hin varna inlang theina a um.

"And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.","Chun, ka hang en a, Berâmte chu Zion Tlânga ngîrin le an chala a hming le a Pa hming ziek, mi nuoi khat le sîng li le sâng li a kuoma chun an um a."
"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps:","Chun, vâna inthawka rawl ri, tui tamtak ri ang le, vâninrûm ri nasatak ri ang, ka hriet a; chun, ka ri hriet chu ṭingṭang keituhaiin an ṭingṭang an kei ri ang a na,"
"and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth.","lalṭhungpha hmaa le, thilhring pali le upahai hmaa chun hla thar ni âwmtak hi an sak a; chun, hnuoia inthawka intlan tah, mi nuoi khat le sîng li le sâng li chau naw khan chu, tûkhawmin chu hla chu an inchûk thei nawh."
"These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.",Chuonghai chu nuhmeia insuk- thiengnaw nawhai chu an nih; nunghâk inthieng ang an ni sih a.

And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.,"An baua khêl a suok hrim miin an hriet ngai nawh, sawisêlbo an ni sih a."
"And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;","Chun, hnuoia umhai kuoma le, hnam tinrêng dâm, chi tinrêng dâm, ṭawng tinrêng dâm kuoma tlângin- sampui dinga chatuon Chanchin Ṭha nei vântirko dang vânlaizâwla vuong ka hmuh a;"
"and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.","Ama chun rawl inringtakin, “A rorêl hun chu a hung tlung ta leiin Pathien chu ṭi unla, chawimawi ro; vân dâm, hnuoi dâm, tuisuoriet dâm, tui hnâr dâm siemtu chu chibai bûk ro,” a tih a."
"And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.","Chun, vântirko dang, a pahnina chun, “Babulon khaw ropui, a mi dit chîngna leia lunginsenna uoiin hnam po po indâwntirtu chu, a tlâwm tah!” tiin a hung zui a."
"And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,","Chun, vântirko dang, a pathum- na chun rawl inringtakin, “Tû- khawmin Sahrâng le a lim chibai bûkin a chala manih, a kuta manih inchikna a nei chun, chu mi ngei chun Pathien lunginsenna uoiin,"
"he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:","a lunginsenna noa iengkhawm pawl loa siem chu dâwn a ta, vântirko inthienghai mithmua le Berâmte mithmua chun mei le kâta sawisakin um bawk a tih."
"and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.","Chun, chuong mihai sawisakna meikhu chu chatuonin hang fêng a ta; Sahrâng le a lim chibai bûktuhai, a hming inchikna nei taphawthai khawm chun, a sûn a zânin châwl hrim nei naw ni hai,” tiin anni chu a hung zui a."
"Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.",Hitaka hin mi inthieng Pathien thupêkhai le Isu ringna thu zâwm- tuhai selna inlang theina a um.
"And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.","Chun, vâna inthawkin rawlin, “Hienghin ziek rawh: Tuta hnung chu mithi, Lalpaa thihai chu, an hamṭha.

"And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.","Chun, ka hang en a, sûm vâr tak ka hmuh a. Sûm chunga chun mihriem naupa ang tak hi, rângka- chak lallukhum khuma, kâwite ngei- tak chawia ṭhung ka hmu bawk a."
"And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.","Chun, vântirko dang, Pathien biekina inthawkin a hung suok a, sûm chunga ṭhung kuoma chun rawl inringtakin, “I kâwite kha keidawk la, ât rawh; ât a hun ta sih a; hnuoi bu khu a ngui zo tah khu,” a ta."
And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.,"Chuongchun, sûm chunga ṭhung chun a kâwite chu hnuoiah a thlâk a, hnuoi bu chu an ât tah a."
"And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.","Chun, vântirko dang vâna Pathien biekina inthawkin a hung suok nâwk a, ama khawm chun kâwite ngeitak a chawi bawk a."
"And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.","Chun, vântirko dang, mei chunga thuneitu chu, mâichâma inthawkin a hung suok nâwk a; chun, ama chun rawl inringtakin, “I kâwite ngeitak kha keidawk la, hnuoia grêp hrui ra bâwrhai khu zu ât rawh, grêp rahai khu a hmin ṭuo ta khu,” tiin kâwite ngeitak chawitu chu a ko a."
"And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress, of the wrath of God.","Chuongchun, vântirko chun a kâwite chu hnuoiah a thlâk a, hnuoia grêp ra chu a ât a, grêp sâwrna khur lientak, Pathien lunginsenna grêp sâwrna khura chun a the lût a."
"And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.","Chun, khaw puo tienga grêp sâwrna khura chun a sir sâwr a, chuongchun, grêp sâwrna khura inthawk chun thisen a hung suok a, fîng sîng khat le za ruk chen sakawr- hai thîrbar chena inthûk a nih."
"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.","Chun, vânah inchikna dang ropuitak le maktak ka hmu a, vântirko pasari hremna pasari chawihai chu; chuong chu hremna nuhnung takhai an nih; chuonga chun Pathien lunginsenna chu a kim ta sih a."
"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.","Chun, hlimen mei le inpawl tuisuoriet ni âwmtak ka hmuh a; Sahrâng dâm, a lim dâm, a hming nambar dâm hnea hung suokhai chu Pathien ṭingṭang chawia, hlimen tuisuoriet panga ngîr ka hmu bawk a."
"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.","Chun, Pathien suok Mosie le Berâmte hla an sak a, “Aw Lalpa Pathien Iengkimthawthei, I thilthawhai chu a ropuiin a mak a; Nang, hnam tin Laltak, I lampuihai chu a felin ân dik a nih."
"Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.","Aw Lalpa, tu am i hming inza nawh a, Chawimawi naw ding?

"And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:","Chuong hnunga chun ka hang en a, chun, vâna inhriettirna biekbûk pindan sûngril chu ân hawng a;"
"and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure and bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.","chuongchun, pindan sûngrila inthawk chun hremna pasari chawi vântirko pasarihai chu, puon in- thieng vârtak silin, an âwm rang- kachak kâwngkhia inkhitin an hung suok a."
"And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.","Chun, thilhring pali laia pakhat chun vântirko pasarihai kuoma chun, Pathien chatuona hring zing lungin- sennaa sip rângkachak berbu pasari a pêk a."
"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.","Chun, pindan sûngril chu Pathien ropuina le a thilthawtheina khuin a sip tah a; vântirko pasarihai hremna pasari chu a bo hmakhat pindan sûngrila chun tûkhawm an lût thei nawh."
"And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.","Chun, pindan sûngrila in- thawk chun rawl inringtakin, vântirko pasarihai kuoma chun, “Fe unla, Pathien lunginsenna berbuhai chu hnuoiah bunthla ro,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.","Chun, a hmasatak chu a feh a, a berbu chu hnuoiah a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, Sahrâng inchikna nei- hai le a lim chibai bûkhai chunga chun pânsie natakin ân chang tah a."
"And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, even the things that were in the sea.","Chun, a pahnina chun a berbu chu tuisuorietah a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, mithi thisen angin thi- senin ân chang tah a; chun, thilhring tinrêng tuisuorieta umhai chu an thi ta vawng a."
And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.,"Chun, a pathumna chun a berbu chu vadungahai le tuikhurahai a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, thisenin ân chang tah a."
"And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge:","Chun, tui vântirko chun, “Nang Mi Inthieng, hieng anga ro i rêl leiin, nang um zing le um tah, i fel ie."
"for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy.","Anni chun mi inthienghai le zâwlneihai thisen an insuoh a; chun, nangin dâwn dinga thisen ma i pêk thung hi dâwn tlâk an ni hrim deh,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.","Chun, mâichâm chun, “Anih, Aw Lalpa Pathien, Iengkimthawthei, i rorêlhai chu ân dikin a fel a nih,” a ti ka hriet a."
And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire.,"Chun, a palina chun a berbu chu nisaah a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, nisa chu meia mihriem em ût dingin thilthawtheina an pêk a."
And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.,"Chuongchun, mihai chu lumtaka em ûtin an um a, chuong hremna chunga thuneitu Pathien hming chu an hrilsiet a, ama chawimawi dingin an sim chuong nawh."
"And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,","Chun, a pangana chun a berbu chu Sahrâng lalṭhungphaah a bun- thlâk a; chuongchun, a ram chu a hung inthim ta vawng a. Chun, an nat leiin an lei an se a,"
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.,an nahai le an pânnahai leiin vâna Pathien chu an hrilsiet a; an thilthawhai chu an sim chuong nawh.
"And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrising.","Chun, a parukna chun a berbu chu tuipui Euphratesa chun a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, nisa suokna tieng panga lal hung dinghai ta dinga lampui chu inzosa a hung ni theina dingin, a tui chu a kang intan tah a."
"And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:","Chun, drakon baua inthawk le Sahrâng baua inthawk le, zâwlnei tehlêm baua inthawk chun thlarau inthiengnaw pathum u ni âwmtak, hung suok ka hmuh a."
"for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.","Chuong chu khawhri thlarau, thilmak thaw hlakhai an nih.

"(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.)","(Ngai ta, inru angin ka hung ding a nih; inringa a puon dierkei zing chu a hamṭha, chuong naw chun, saruokin lêng a ta, a zamaw hmu rawi an tih)."
And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.,Hmun pakhat Hebrai ṭawnga Har-Magedon an tia chun an ṭhuoi khâwm tah a.
"And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done:","Chun, a pasarina chun a berbu chu boruokah a bunthlâk a; chuong- chun, pindan sûngrila, Lalṭhungphaa inthawkin, “A kim tah,” tiin rawl inringtak a hung suok a."
"and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.","Chun, kâwlinlep dâm, rawl dâm, vâninrûm dâm, a hung um tah a, simkhawleihnuoi khawm nasatak- in ân hnîng a, hnuoia mihriem uma inthawk chuong ang hrima nasa a la um ngai nawh, simkhawleihnuoi inhnîng chuong ang lâwma nasa le ropui chu."
"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.","Chuongchun, khaw ropui chu hmun thumah a hung inṭheh a, hnam tin khuohai chu a hung chim a; chun, a lunginsen nasatna uoin no chu a kuoma pêk dingin Babulon khaw ropui chu Pathien hmaa hriet zingin a lo um tah a."
"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.","Chun, thlierkâr tinrêng a bo ta vawng a, tlânghai khawm a um ta nawh a."
"And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.","Chun, riel lientak talent tluk raua rik seng, vâna inthawkin mihriemhai chungah a tlah a; chun, mihriemhai chun riela hremna lei chun Pathien an hrilsiet tah a; chu hremna chu a nasa bêk bêk sih a."
"And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;","Chun, vântirko pasari berbu pasari chawihai laia pakhat chun a mi biek a. “Hung ta, tui tamtaka ṭhung, nawchizawr ropuitak hremna chu inentir ka ti che."
"with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.","Hnuoia lalhai chun ama chu an dit hlak a, hnuoia umhai khawm chu a mi dit chîngna uoin chun vai ruiin an um hlak,” a ta."
"And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.","Chuongchun, ama chun Thla- rauin thlalêrah a mi fepui a; chun, Pathien hrilsietna hminga sip, lu sari le ki sâwm nei, sahrâng seninlâr chunga chuong nuhmei ka hmuh a."
"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication,","Chu nuhmei chun puon sen duk le sen lâr a sil a, rângkachak le lungmantam le tuikeplungin ân chei a. Rângkachak no, thil tirdakum, a mi dit chîngna thil inthiengnawa sip a chawi a."
"and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.","A bâwka chun thurûk, “BABU- LON KHAW ROPUI, HNUOIA NAW- CHIZAWRHAI LE THIL TIRDAK- UMHAI NU,” tia hming ziek a um a."
"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.","Chun, chu nuhmei chu mi inthienghai thisen le Isu martarhai thisena inruiin ka hmuh a. Ka hmu phingleh mak ka ti bêk bêk a."
"And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.","Chuongchun, vântirko chun ka kuomah, “Ieng leiin am mak i tih a? Nuhmei le a phurtu sahrâng lu sari le ki sâwm nei thurûk hril ka ti che."
"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come.","Sahrâng i hmu kha a um ta zet a, a um nâwk ta nawh a; chun, vânsama inthawkin hung suok a ta, bo- hmangnaah fêng a tih.

"And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.","Chun, sahrâng um ta zeta, um nâwk ta naw ngei khawm kha a parietna a na, pasarihai laia mi kha a ni nghe nghe a; bohmangnaah fêng a tih."
"And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.","“Chun, ki sâwm i hmuhai kha lal sâwm ram la nei nawhai an nih; dârkâr khat sûng chu sahrâng leh lalhai angin thuneina la hmûng an tih."
"These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.","Chuongchun, thu hmunkhatin an thilthawtheina le thuneina chu sahrâng pêng an tih."
"These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they also shall overcome that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.","Chuongchun, Berâmte chu do an ta, chun, Berâmte chu hotuhai Hotu le lalhai Lal a ni leiin anni chu hnêng a tih; chun, a kuoma um, ko- hai, thlanghai, ringumhai chun hne bawk an tih,” a tih a."
"And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.","Chun, ama bawk chun ka kuomah, “Nawchizawr ṭhungna tui i hmuhai kha, mi dâm, mipui dâm, hnam dâm, ṭawng dâm a nih."
"And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.","Chun, ki sâwm i hmu le sahrâng chun nawchizawr chu theidâng an ta, iengkhawm neinaw le saruokin siem an tih, a sa khawm fâng an ta, meiin rawhmang an tih."
"For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.","Pathien thuhai chu a tlung hmakhat chun a dit zâwng an thawna ding le thu thuhmuna an um theina dingin le, an ram chu sahrâng kuoma an pêkna dingin Pathienin an lung- rilah a tir ta sih a."
"And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.","Chun, i nuhmei hmu kha, khaw ropui, hnuoia lalhai chunga rorêltu chu a nih,” a ta."
"After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.","Chuong hnunga chun vântir- ko dang, thuneina nasatak neiin vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka hmuh a; a ropuinain hnuoi chu a el ta vawng a."
"And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.","Chun, ama chun rawl inring- takin, “Babulon khaw ropui chu a tlâwm tah, a tlâwm tah! khawhrihai umna le, thlarau inthiengnaw tin- rêng kulbîng le, vate inthiengnaw le tirdakum tinrêng kulbîng a hung ni tah."
"For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness.","A mi dit chîng leia a lunginsenna uoin chu hnam po poin an dâwn ta sih a; hnuoia lalhai chun ama chu an dit hlak a, hnuoia sumdâwngtuhai chun ân hawitir taluotna chu an hausak pha hlak,” tiin a khêk a."
"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:","Chun, vâna inthawkin rawl dangin hienghin a hril ka hriet, “Ka mihai, an rîtlonaahai in ṭhangnawna ding le, a hremnahai in hmu ve nawna dingin a sûnga inthawkin suok ro."
"for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.","A suolnahai chun vân khawm a tawng ta hiel a, Pathienin a thilthaw felnawhai khawm chu a hriet zing sih a."
"Render unto her even as she rendered, and double unto her the double according to her works: in the cup which she mingled, mingle unto her double.","Amain a pêk ang ngei khan pe thung unla, a thilthawzie ang pei chu a lêt hniin thung unla, a chawkpawl- na noa chun a ta dingin a lêt hniin chawkpawlpêk ro."
"How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning.","“Ân sukropui le ân hawitirzie ang pei khan sawisain suklungngai thung ro; a lungril chun, ‘Lalnuin ka ṭhung a nih, hmeithai hrim ka ni nawh a, lungngaina hmu dêr naw ningah’, a ti sih a."
"Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her.","Chuleiin, ni khat sûngin a hrem- na hri dâm, lungngaina dâm, ṭâm dâm chu–hung tlung vawng a tih; meia rawhmangin um bawk a tih; a rorêltu, Lalpa Pathien chu a hrât sih a."
"And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning,","“Chun, hnuoia lal, a dit hlakhai le ân hawitirpui hlakhai chun, a kâng khu chu an hmu pha a chunga ṭapin âwm inchum an ta;"

So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.,Nang khawmin Nikolahai in- chûktirna thu chuong ang bawka pawm tuhai amanih i umpui bawk a nih.
"Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.","Chuongchun, sim rawh, chuong naw chun i kuomah hung vak ka ta, ka baua kâwlhnâm chun anni hung do ka tih."
"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass:","“Chun, Thuatiraa kohran tirko kuoma chun hieng hin ziek rawh:— “ ‘Pathien Naupa, mit meichawk ang nei, a kephahai dâr tle mi ang khan, hieng thu hi a hril a nih:"

"But I have this against thee, that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.","Nisienlakhawm, demna che ka nei; nuhmei, Jezebel, Zâwlneinu inti kha, i ngai thei leiin; ama chun ka suokhai chu indit le milim biekna thil fâk inchûktirin, a ṭhuoi hmang bawk hlak a nih."
And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication.,"Simna dingin a kuomah hun bi ka tuk a, nisienlakhawm, mi dit a chîng chu a sim nuom nawh."
"Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.","Ngai ta, ama chu khumah ka pei ding a nih, a rêtpuituhai khawm chu, a thil thaw chînghai chu an sim san naw chun, rinum nasatakah pei bawk ka tih."
And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.,"A nauhai chu hriin sukhlum ka ta; chuongchun, kei lungril le lungvar entu ka ni ti kohranhai po po chun hrieng an tih; chun in thaw ang peiin pe seng ka ti cheu."

"And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,","Drakon, rûlpui tar chu (chu chu Diebol le Setan a nih) a man a, kum sâng khata dingin a khuop a,"

"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.","Chun, lalṭhungphahai ka hmuh a, a chungah mi an ṭhung a, an kuoma chun rorêlna an pêk a.

The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection.,(Mithi danghai ruok chu kum sâng khat chu ân vawi hmakhat chu an la hring hri nawh a.) Chu chu thonâwkna hmasa chu a nih.

"And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,","Chun, kum sâng khat chu ân vawi pha chun Setan chu ân tângnaa inthawka insuoin um a ta,"

"And he came, and he taketh it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.","Chun, ama chu a hung a, lalṭhungphaa ṭhung kut chang tienga lekhabu chu a lâk tah a."
"And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.","Chun, lekhabu chu a lâk phing- leh thilhring pali le upa sâwmhni le pali hai chu, ṭingṭang le rângkachak berbu riminhnika sip chawi sengin, Berâmte hmaa chun an bawkkhup tâwl tah a; chuong riminhnikhai chu mi inthienghai ṭawngṭaina a nih."
"And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood men of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,","Chun, hla thar an sak a, “Nang lekhabu chu laa, A închiknahai sût tlâk i nih; Thatin i um tah a, Chi tina mi dâm, ṭawng tina mi dâm, Mi tina mi dâm, hnam tina mi dâm, Pathien ta dingin i thisenin închâwk a,"
and madest them to be unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon the earth.,"Kan Pathien ta dingin khuoletui le, Thiempuahai i siem ta sih a; Chun hnuoiah ro rêl an tih,” tiin."
"And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;","Chun, ka hang en a, lalṭhung- pha le thilhringhai le upahai vêla chun vântirko tamtak rawl ka hriet a; an tam tieng chu a sînga sîng hmun sîng tamtak le a sânga sâng hmun sâng tamtak an nih;"
"saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing.","chuonghai chun rawl inring takin, “Berâmte that ta hi Thilthawtheina dâm, hausakna dâm, Varna dâm, hrâtna dâm, chawimawina dâm, ropuina dâm, Malsâwmna dâm hmu tlâk a nih ie,” an ta."
"And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them, heard I saying, Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever.","Chun, vân le hnuoi chung le, hnuoi hnuoi le, tuisuoriet chunga thilsiem tinrêng umhai le, chuonghai sûnga um po pohaiin, “Lalṭhungphaa ṭhung le, Berâmte kuoma chun, Malsâwmna dâm, chawimawina dâm, Ropuina dâm, rorêlna dâm, Chatuonin um raw se,” an ti ka hriet bawk a."
"And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.","Chun, thilhring palihai chun, “Amen”, an tih a. Upahai khawm chun bawkkhupin chibai an bûk tah a."
"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come.","Chun, Berâmte chun inchikna pasari laia pakhat chu a sût lai ka hmuh a; chun, thilhring palihai laia pakhat chun, vâninrûm ang elin, “Hung rawh,” a ti ka hriet a,"
"And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.","Chuongchun, ka hang en a, chun, ngai ta, sakawr vâr ka hmuh a; a chunga chuong chun thalngul a chawi a; chun, a kuoma chun lallukhum an pêk a; chun, hne pum le hne pei dingin a suok tah a."
"And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.","Chun, inchikna pahnina chu a hang sût phingleh, thilhring pahnina chun, “Hung rawh,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And another horse came forth, a red horse: and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.","Chuongchun, sakawr dang, a sen mi, a hung suok nâwk a; a chunga chuong kuoma chun hnuoia inthawka inremna lâkpêk theina le, mi inthattir theina an pêk a; chun, a kuomah kâwlhnâm lientak an pêk bawk a."
"And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand.","Chun, inchikna pathumna chu a hang sût phingleh, thilhring pathum- na chun, “Hung rawh,” a ti ka hriet a. Chuongchun, ka hang en a, chun, ngai ta, sakawr dum ka hmuh a; a chunga chuong chun bûkna a chawi a."
"And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil and the wine hurt thou not.","Chun, thilhring palihai laia in- thawk chun râwl âwmtak hin, “Duliin bupui tekhâwng khat, duliin buṭei tekhâwng thum, hriek le uoiin ruok chu sukse naw,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.","Chun, inchikna palina chu a hang sût phingleh, thilhring palina rawl chun, “Hung rawh,” a ti ka hriet a."
"And I saw, and behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.","Chuongchun, ka hang en a, chun, ngai ta, sakawr dâng ka hmuh a; a chunga chuong hming chu Thina a na; chun, Mithi Khuoin a hung zui a.

"And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:","Chun, inchikna pangana chu a hang sût phingleh, mâichâm hnuoia Pathien thu lei le an pawm inhriettirna thu leia thathai thlarau chu ka hmuh a;"
"and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?","anni chun rawl inringtakin, “Aw Lalpa, mi inthieng le indiktak, ieng chen am rorêl loa hnuoia umhai chunga kan thisen insuona phuba chu la loa i um ding?” tiin an khêk a."
"And there was given them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, who should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled their course.","Chun, an kuoma chun puon vâr an pêk seng a; chun, an suok chanpuihai le an unauhai, anni ang bawka that dinghai khawm chu an kim hmakhat chun an la châwl hri ding a nih ti an hril a."
"And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;","Chun, inchikna parukna chu a hang sût lai ka en zing a, chun, simkhawleihnuoi nasatakin a hung inhnîng a; chun, nisa chu sahmul saiip puon angin a hung dum a, thla khawm chu a pumin thisen angin a hung um tah a."
"and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind.","Chun, vâna arasihai chu, theichang kûng thlipuiin a nuoi a, a selhai a ṭil ang elin hnuoiah an tla tah a."
And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.,"Vân chu lekhabu zuolmi zuola ân hmang angin, ân hmang tah a; tlâng le thlierkâr tinrêng chu an umnaa inthawkin sawnin an um tah a."
"And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;","Chun, hnuoia lal dâm, mi lien dâm, sipai hotu tak dâm, mi hausa dâm, mi hrât dâm, suok le suok naw tinrênghai chu pûka le tlânga lungpuihaia chun an inbih a."
"and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:","Tlânghai le lungpuihai kuoma chun, “Mi del unla, lalṭhungphaa ṭhung hmêla inthawk le, Berâmte lunginsennaa inthawk hin mi hlie ro;"
for the great day of their wrath is come; and who is able to stand?,"an lunginsenna ni ropuitak chu a hung tlung ta hi; chuongchun, tu am ngîr thei an ta?” an tih a."
"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.","Chu hnunga chun khawmuola le tuisuorieta le, thing hrim hrima chun thli hrim a hrâng nawna dingin, hnuoi thli pali chu chelin hnuoi kil lia ngîr vântirko pali ka hmuh a."
"And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,","Chun, vântirko dang, Pathien hring inchikna chawi, nisa suoknaa hang fe ka hmu bawk a; chun, ama chun vântirko pali, khawmuol le tuisuoriet suksiet theina pêka umhai kuoma chun, rawl inringtakin,"
"saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.","“Ei Pathien suokhai chu an chala kan inchik hmakhat chu khawmuol le tuisuoriet le, thinghai chu sukse hri naw ro,” tiin a khêk a."
"And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:","Chun, an inchik zât chu ka lo hriet a, Israel thlahai hnam tina mi nuoi khat le sîng li le sâng li an inchik tah a nih."
Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;,"Juda hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Reuben hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Gad hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni,"
Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;,"Aser hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Naphtali hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Manasse hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni,"
Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;,"Simeon hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Levi hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Issakar hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni,"
Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.,"Zebulun hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Josef hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Benjamin hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni an inchik tah a nih."
"After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands;","Chu hnunga chun ka hang en a, chun, ngai ta, mipui nasatak tû- khawm itiem sêng naw, hnam tin laia mi dâm, chi tin laia mi dâm, mi tin laia mi dâm, ṭawng tin laia mi dâm puon vâr sila, tûm kâu chawiin, lalṭhungpha hma le Berâmte hmaa ngîr ka hmuh a;"
"and they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.","chuonghai chun rawl inring- takin, “Ei Pathien lalṭhungphaa ṭhung kuoma le, Berâmte kuomah sandamna,” tiin an khêk a."
"And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and about the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,","Chun, vântirko po pohai chu lalṭhungpha le upahai le thilhring palihai vêla chun ngîrin an um a; chun, lalṭhungpha hmaa chun bawk- khupin."
"saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.","“Amen, malsâwmna dâm, ropuina dâm, varna dâm, Lâwmthu hrilna dâm, chawimawina dâm, Thilthawtheina dâm, hrâtna dâm, Chatuonin ei Pathien kuomah um raw se, Amen” tiin Pathien chibai an bûk a."
"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and whence came they?","Chun, upahai laia pakhat chun, ka kuomah, “Hieng puon vâr silhai hi tuhai am an na, khâwtaka inthawka hung am an ni a?” tiin a mi biek a."
"And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.","Kei chun a kuomah, “Pu, nangin i hriet annâwm,” ka ta. Ama chun ka kuomah, “Hieng hi rinum nasataka inthawka suokhai kha an nih, an puonhai Berâmte thisena sâwpin an sukvâr tah a."
Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.,"Chuleiin, Pathien ṭhungpha hmaah an um a nih, chun, a sûn a zânin a biekina chun a rawng an bâwl hlak a; lalṭhungphaa ṭhung chun an chungah puon in chu zâr a tih."
"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat:","An phîng ṭâm ta naw nih a, dangchâr ta bawk naw ni hai; nisain em naw nih a, lum hrim hrim khawm- in sukrinum ta bawk naw nih."
"for the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.","Berâmte, lalṭhungpha laia um chu an vêngtu nîng a ta, hringna tuikhurahai ṭhuoi a tih; chun, Pathienin an mita inthawk mitthli po po hrufai tâng a tih,” a ta."
"And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.","Inchikna pasarina chu a hang sût phingleh, dâr chenve lai vân chu a dei ṭhuop a."
And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.,"Chun, vântirko pasari Pathien hmaa ngîr hlakhai chu ka hmuh a; an kuomah tawtawrâwt pasari an pêk a."
"And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.","Chun, vântirko dang a hung a, rângkachak riminhnik rawna bâwm chawiin mâichâm kâwla chun a ngîr tah a; lalṭhungpha hmaa rângkachak mâichâm chunga mi inthienghai po po ṭawngṭainahai belsana dingin, riminhnik tamtak a kuomah an pêk a."
"And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.","Riminhnik raw khu chu vântirko kuta inthawk chun Pathien hmaah a hang fe tah a, mi inthienghai ṭawng- ṭainahai le chun."
"And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.","Chun, vântirko chun riminhnik rawna bâwm chu a lâk a, mâichâma meiin a suksip a, hnuoiah a peithlâk tah a; chuongchun, vâninrûm dâm, rawl dâm, kâwlinlep dâm, simkhaw- leihnuoi inhnîng dâm, a hung um ve nghâl tah a."
And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.,"Chun, vântirko pasari tawtaw- râwt pasari chawihai chu mût dingin an inbuotsai tah a."
"And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.","A hmasatak chun a hang mût a, riel le mei, thisen le inpawl, a hung um nghâl a, chu chu hnuoia pei thlâkin a um tah a; hnuoi hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a kâng hmang a, thinghai khawm hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a kâng hmang a, hlohna hring po po khawm a kâng hmang ta bawk a."
"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;","Vântirko pahnina chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, tlâng lientak meia kâng lai ang tuisuorietah an pei thlâk a."
"and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.","Chuongchun, tuisuoriet hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu thisenin a hung inchang tah a.

"And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters;","Vântirko pathumna chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, arasi lien- tak, meiser anga chawk, vâna in- thawkin a hung tlah a, vadung hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat le tuikhurhai chu a del tah a."
"and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.","Chu arasi hming chu Sairam a nih. Tui hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu sairamah a hung inchang tah a; chuongchun, chu tui chu an dâwn a, mi tamtak an thih a, a hung khâk tâk leiin."
"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.","Vântirko palina chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, nisa hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat, thla hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat, arasihai khawm hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu suksiet a ni tah a; chuonghai hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu ân thimna ding le, sûn chu hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a var nawna dingin, zân khawm chuong ang bawkin a nih."
"And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.","Chun, ka hang en a, mupui vân- laizâwla vuongin, rawl inringtakin, “Vantirko pathum tawtawrâwt la mût ding, chu ri la hung um dinghai lei chun hnuoia umhai chung a rik ie, a rik ie, a rik ie!” a ti ka hriet a."
"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.","Chun, vântirko pangana chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, arasi, vâna inthawka hnuoia tla sa ka hmuh a; chun, vânsam khur chabi chu a kuomah an pêk a,"
"And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.","Ama chun vânsam khur chu a hawng a; chuongchun, khura in- thawk chun mei khu, rawtuina mei khu nasatak khu ang, a hung suok a; chun, khura mei lei chun nisa le boruok chu a hung inthim tah a."
"And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.","Mei khua inthawk chun khâuhai hnuoi chungah an hung suok a, hnuoia ainuvêthaiin thilthawtheina an nei ang hin, an kuomah thil- thawtheina an pêk a."
"And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.","An chala Pathien inchikna nei naw mihriemhai chau naw chu, hnuoia hlohna dâm, thilhring hrim hrim dâm, thing hrim hrim dâm khawm suksiet naw ding ti an hril a."
"And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.","Chun, an kuoma chun mi- hriemhai chu sukhlum êm loa, thla nga sukrinum lem dingin thu an pêk a; an sukrinumzie chu ainu- vêtin mi a seh a, a sukrinum ang hi a nih."
"And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.","Chuong nia chun mihaiin thina zawng an ta, hmu dêr si naw ni hai; thi inhâwk an ta, nisienlakhawm, thina chun tlân san a tih."
"And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men’s faces.","Chun, khâuhai piengzie chu sakawr, indona dinga inzosa ang an nih; lallukhum ang el rângkachak ang an khum a, an hmai khawm mihriem hmai ang a nih."
"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.","Nuhmei sam ang hi sam an nei a, an ha khawm chu sakeibaknei ha ang a nih."
"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war.","Thîr âwmphaw ang hi âwmphaw an nei a; an thla zâp ri chu indona tawlailîr ri, sakawr tamtak indo dinga tlân dur dur ri ang a nih."
"And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.","Ainuvêt mei ang hin mei an nei a, sêna khawm; chun, an meia chun a nih thla nga sûnga an mihriem suknat theina chu a um chu."
"They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue he hath the name Apollyon.","Vânsam khur tirko chu an chunga laltakah an nei a, Hebrai ṭawngin a hming chu Abaddon a nih, Grik ṭawng ruok chun a hming chu Apolluon a nih."
"The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.","Chungrikna hmasatak chu a bo tah a, ngai ta, tuta hnung chungrikna pahni la um a tih."
"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,","Chun, vântirko parukna chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, Pathien hmaa rângkachak mâichâm kihaia inthawk chun rawl ka hriet a."
"one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.","Chu rawl chun vântirko paruk- na, tawtawrâwt chawi kuoma chun, “Euphrates vadunga vântirko pali khuophai kha sût rawh,” a ta."
"And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.","Chuongchun, chu dârkâr le ni le thla le kuma ding chun, mihriem hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat suk- hlumtu dinga buotsai tah, vântirko palihai chu an sût tah a."
And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.,Sipai sakawr chung chuonghai chu an tam tieng sîng ruoka hmun sîng hni an nih; an tam tieng chu mi hril ka hriet a nih.
"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.","Chun, inlârnaa chun sakawr le an chunga chuonghai chu hieng ang hin ka hmu a nih, mei le ngên le kât ang hi âwmphaw an nei a, Sakawr luhai chu sakeibaknei lu ang hi a nih, an baua inthawk chun mei le meikhu le kâthai a suok a."
"By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.",Chuong hremna pathum hai chun mihriem hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu a sukhlum tah a–mei le meikhu le kât an baua inthawka suok khan.
"For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt.","Sakawrhai thilthawtheina chu an baua le an meiah a nih a um chu. An meihai chu rûl ang a na, luhai a nei bawk a; chu chun a nih mi an suknat hlak chu."
"And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:","Mihriem, chuong hremnaa sukhlum mahlahai chu, an kut thilthawhaia inthawk chun an sim chuong nawh a.

"and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.","An tuolthathai khawm, an dawi hmanghai khawm, an indithai khawm, an inrûkhai khawm an sim chuong nawh."
