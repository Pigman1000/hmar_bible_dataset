"The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.","Juda lalhai Uzzia, Jotham, Ahaz le Hezekia inlal lai le Israel lal Jeroboam, Joas naupa inlal laia Beeri naupa Hosea kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung chu."
"When Jehovah spake at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land doth commit great whoredom, departing from Jehovah.","Hosea hmanga LALPA thu hril phutna chu. LALPA chun Hosea kuomah, “Fe la, nawchizawr thla, nawchizawr mi, nuhmeiah va nei rawh, hi ram hin LALPA chu a uiret hmangsan tah,” a tih a."
"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.","Chuongchun, a feh a, Diblaim naunu Gomer chu a nei tah a; chun, nau a vawn a, naupasal a neipêk a."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.","Chun, LALPA chun a kuomah, “A hmingah Jezreel sak rawh; Jezreel thisen phuba chu Jehu sûnghai chungah lâng ka ta; Israel sûnghai ram chu suktâwp ka tih."
"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.","Chun, chu nia chun Jezreel ruomah Israelhai thalngul chu suktliek ka tih,” a ta."
"And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And Jehovah said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.","Chun, nau a vawn nâwk a, naunuhmei a nei a. Chun, a kuomah, “A hmingah Lo-ruhama sak rawh; Israel sûnghai chu ka lainat ngai ta naw ding a nih, ka ngaidam vak ta âwm si nawh a."
"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.","Juda sûnghai ruok chu lainat ka ta, thalngul amanih, kâwlhnâm amanih, indona amanih, sakawr amanih, sakawr chung chuong mi amaniha anni sandam loin, LALPA an Pathien chun sandam ka tih,” a ta."
"Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.","Chun, Lo-ruhama chu nêne nêk ân bântir a, chun, nau a vawn nâwk a, naupasal a nei a."
"And Jehovah said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.","Chun, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih a, “A hmingah Lo-ammi sak rawh, nangni hi ka mihai in ni si nawh a; chun, kei khawm in Pathien ni naw ning,” a ta."
"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel nauhai chu tuisuorieta phaiphin, inkhi ruol lo le tiem ruol lo zât nîng an ta; chun, an kuomah, “Ka mihai in ni nawh” tina hmun ngeia chun “Pathien hring nauhai in nih,” ti nîng a tih."
"And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.","Chun, Juda nauhai le Israel nauhai chu pung khâwm an ta, an lu ding ruot an ta, chu rama inthawk chun hang fêng an ta, Jezreel ni chu a ropui ding a ni sih a."
"Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.","Israel chu grêp hrui inbuktak, ra hautak a nih; A ra tam hu ang peiin a mâichâm a sukpung a, A ram ṭhatzie ang peiin lung inser phun ṭhatak tak a siem a,"
"Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.","A lungril chu sukṭhein a um a, Tuhin chu thiemnaw changin um tâng an tih. An mâichâmhai chu amân vaw chim a ta, An lung inser phunhai chu suksieng a tih."
"Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us?","“Lal tak tak chu ei nei nawh, LALPA chu ei ṭi si nawh a; Chu lal chun ieng am mi thawpêk thei a ta?” tiin, tuhin chu hril ta ngei an tih."
"They speak vain words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.","Thuthlung an siemna tienga chun khêla inkhâmin. Thu teplo an hril a; Chuleiin, lo inlet changkuong thlûra hlohna tûr nei ang elin Rorêlna a hung inder suok a nih."
"The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.",Samaria rama chênghai chu Beth-aven bâwngtê lei chun thlaphângin um an tih; A kuoma inthawka a bo ta leiin chutaka mihai chu lungngai an ta; Chutaka thiempuhai a ropuina chunga lo lâwm hlakhai khawm.
"It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.","Ama ngei khawm chu Laltak Jareb kuoma pêk dingin, Assuria rama fe hmangpui nîng a tih. Ephraim chun inzakna hmûng a ta. Israel khawm chun ama thurawt ngei chu inzâpui a tih."
"As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.","Samaria ram hlak chu tui chunga thing hlek nawi ang el hin, A lal chu sukbohmang a na."
"The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.","Israel suolna Aven hmun insânghai khawm chu suksiet nîng a tih, An mâichâmahai chun hling le hlohlingnei hung ṭo a tih. Tlâng kuoma chun, “Mîn khum rawh,” tîng an ta; Muol kuoma chun, “Mi del rawh,” tîng an tih."
"O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah.","Aw Israel, Gibea nia inthawk ta khan i suol a nih; Chutaka chun an la ngîr zing a; Rîtlona nauhai chunga dona chun Gibea ngeia chun a hnawtphâk tâwl naw ding maw?"
"When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.","Ka nuom pha chun anni chu hrem ka ta, Chun, an bawsietna pahnia an intâng pha chun, An chungah mipuihai chu pungkhâwm an tih."
"And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out the grain; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.","Ephraim chu bâwngla inchûktir tah, Bu chîl hrâttak a nih; Nisienlakhawm, kei ngei hin a rîng mawitaka chun Rîngkawl inbâttir tâng ka ta; Ephraim chunga chun mi inchuongtir ka tih; Juda khawm chun hnuoi inlet a ta, Jakob chun a pil tlanghai chu suknâwi a tih."
"Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.","Mâni ta dingin felnain tu unla, Chuongchun, lunginsietna ang peiin sîk ro; In hnuoi chuongtlâihai chu inlet ro, LALPA chu a hunga in chunga felna ân sûrtir chenin Ama chu zawng hun a ni sih a."
"Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.","Rîtlona hnuoi in inlet a, khawhlona in sîk a, Khêlhlip ra in fâk a nih. I tawlailîrhai le i mi hrâthai tam hi i ring vei a."
"Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.","Chuleiin, i mihai laia chun buoi mup mupna hung suok a ta, Salman chun indona nia Beth- arbel a suksiet ang khan, I kulhai po po chu suksiet nîng a tih; Nu chu a nauhai leh peinawiin an um a nih."
So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.,"I rîtlona nasatak leiin, Chuong ang chun Bethel chun thâwng a ti che; Israel lal chu vârṭien laiin sukbohmangdêr nîng a tih."
"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.","Israel chu a naupang lai chena inthawk ka hmangai a, Aigupta rama inthawkin ka naupa dinga ka ko suok a nih."
"The more the prophets called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.","Ka ko râwn po leh an mi hlat zuol det a, Baalhai kuomah an inthâwi lem a. Mi lim siem fâwmhai kuomah riminhnik an raw a nih."
Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.,"Kei ruok chun Ephraim chu ka kuta chelin lâwn kân chûk- tir a, Anni ka înthawtir a nih ti ruok chu an hriet nawh."
"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.","Mihriem hruihruol, hmangaina hruihai chun anni ka kei a, An ta ding chun an khâka kawl hlîppêktu ang chu ka na, Duottakin an hmaah fâk ding ka pêk a."
"They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return to me.","Aigupta rama chun kîr nâwk ta naw ni; Nisienlakhawm, hnungkîr an nuom naw leiin, Assuria chu a lal nîng a tih."
"And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels.","A khawpuihaia chun kâwlhnâm inletin um a ta, A kulhai chu sukbohmang a tih, Anni thu lo râwn ang ngeiin sukbohmang a tih."
"And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him.","Ka mihai chun mi nghatsan an tum zing a, Chuongchun, an ta dingin rîngkawl ruotpêk an nih, Chu chu tukhawma hlîppêk naw nih."
"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.","Aw Ephraim, iengtin am thlauthla thei ka ti che a? Aw Israel, iengtin am inthla thei ka ti che a? Iengtin am Adma angin siem thei ka ti che a? Iengtin am Zeboiim angin inumtir thei ka ti che a? Ka sûnga hin ka lung hi ân lêt a, Ka lunginsietnahai chu ân mûtâi nâwk ta lem a."
"I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.","Ka lunginsen nasatak chu hlen naw ning a, Ephraim chu sukbohmang tum nâwk ta naw ning. Kei chu mihriem ni loin, Pathien ka ni sih a, Nangmaa um Mi Inthieng chu, Khawpui chu hung lûtkhum naw ning."
"They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.","LALPA chu zui an ta, Sakeibaknei anga inrûm ding chu; Anih, inrûm ngei a ta, Khaw thlang tienga inthawkin a nauhai chu Inthin pumin hung an tih."
"They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.","Aiguptaa inthawk chun chawngzawng angin, Assuriaa inthawk chun vaṭhu angin thla zâp sieu sieuin hung an tih; Chun, an in lum inhluotir ka ta, ti hi LALPA thu suok a nih."
"Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.","Ephraim chun khêl thuin a mîn huol vêl a, Israel sûnghai chun hlêmnain; Juda ruok chu Pathien ihriet zingin a um a, Mi Inthieng chunga chun ring a um a nih."
"Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.","Ephraim chun thli a ring a, Khaw sakthli chu a zui hlak a; Khêl thu le inṭhedarna thu a sukpung tiel tiel a, Assuria leh thu an thlung a, Aigupta tieng chun hriek a phur lût a."
"Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.","LALPA chun Juda chunga khawm hêkna ding a nei bawk a, Jakob chu a um dân angzie peiin hrem a tih; A thilthaw angzie peia thungin."
In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:,"Sula khawm khan a unaupa chu a kekhawngah a hung man a, A hung puitling khan Pathien chu a thawh a,"
"yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us,","Anih, vântirko a thawh a, a hne tah, A ṭap a, ditsakna a ngên a, Bethel hmuna chun ama a hmu tah a, Chutaka chun a kuomah thu a hril a;"
"even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial name.","LALPA ngei, Sipaihai Pathien chun; LALPA ti chu a hming a nih."
"Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.","Chuongchun, nang chun i Pathien tieng ngha la, Lunginsietna le rorêlna hmang la; I Pathiena chun innghat rawp rawh."
"He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.","Sumdâwngtu a na, a kutah bûkna indik naw a um a, Hlêm ngawt a châk hlak a nih."
"And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.","Ephraim chun, “Ka hausa takzet el tah a, Kân sukmuk takmeu el ta a nih; Ka sinthaw po poahai hlak chun Keimaa thil suol an hmu ding hlak um dêr lo,” a tih a."
"But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.","Nisienlakhawm, kei hi Aigupta rama inthawk ta khan, LALPA i Pathien chu ka na; Ruoiṭhe hun lai ang khan puon inah lân chêngtir nâwk ka ti che."
"I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.","Zâwlneihai kuoma khawm thu ka hril hlak a, Inlârnahai ka sukpung a; Zâwlneihai hmangin tekhina ka siem hlak;"
"Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.","Gilead chu rîtlona a ni naw am a nih? Teplo el an nih annâwm; Gilgala chun bâwngchal an inhlân hlak a. Anih, an mâichâmhai chu leilet changkuonga Lung dêng khâwm ang el an nih."
"And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.","Jakob chu Aram rama chun a tlân hmang a, Israel chun nuhmei man a tuok tah a; Nuhmei man ding chun berâm a vêng a nih."
"And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.",Zâwlnei hmangin Israel chu Aiguptaa inthawkin LALPAIN a ṭhuoi suok a; Zâwlnei bawk hmang chun a hum bawk a.
"Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.","Ephraim hlak chun a suklungsen nasa êm êm el a, Chuleiin, a thisen insuo chu ama chungah a tla a, A hrilsietna chu ama chungah LALPAIN intlâktir a tih."
"When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.","Ephraimin thu a hril chun inthinna khawp a tling hiel hlak, Israel mihai laia chun ngai ropui a ni mieu sih a. Baal kuoma a tlûk china hin chu a thi tah a nih."
"And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.","Tu khawm hin an suol zuol ta deu deu a, An tangkaruoin milim a sunga sung an insiem fâwm a, Anni ngaidân ang peia milim chu: Chuonghai po po chu themthiemhai kutsuok a ni sa khawmin, Inthâwina inhlântuhai taphawt chun Bâwngtê chu fâwp raw se, an ti hlak."
"Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passeth early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.","Chuleiin, zîngkâr ṭieusûm ang le, Dâidaw inhmataka bo nâwk el hlak ang, Hrizâwla bu si thlivirin a lâk hmang hlak ang, Meikhu suokna meikhu ang nîng an tih."
"Yet I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt know no god but me, and besides me there is no saviour.","Kei ruok hi chu Aigupta rama inthawk tah a, LALPA i Pathien chu ka na, Kei ti naw chu Pathien dang i hriet ngai nawh a; Kei naw hi chu sandamtu dang an um nawh."
"I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.","Ram ṭâwl nasatak, thlalêra inruolpui hlak che kha ka nih."
"According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me.","An fâk ding dawnga chun an tlai a, An tlai chu an lungrilin an chapo phah a, Chuongchun, an mi theinghil tah a nih."
Therefore am I unto them as a lion; as a leopard will I watch by the way;,"Chuleiin, an ta dingin sakeibaknei ang nîng ka ta, Keitê angin lampuiah anni inchân ka tih."
"I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild beast shall tear them.","Savawm a tê chân angin anni chu thâwng ka ta, An lung tuomtuhai chu keithlêr vawng ka ta, Chu hmuna chun sakeibaknei angin Anni fa zo ka tih; Ramsain a kei dar zo ding ang chun."
"It is thy destruction, O Israel, that thou art against me, against thy help.","Aw Israel, nangma ṭhangpuitu i mi do hi, I sietna a nih ie."
"Where now is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?","I khawpui po poa sanhim theitu ding che, I lal chu tuhin khâwlai am a um a? Lal le hotuhai mi pe rawh, i itihai, I rorêltuhai chu khâwlai am an um a?"
"I have given thee a king in mine anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.","Ka lunginsenin lal ka pêk che a, Ka lunginsenin ka lâk hmang nâwk ta a nih."
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.,"Ephraim rîtlona chu ka înkhâwl khâwm a na, A suolna chu thak khâwm a nih."
The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children.,"Nuhmei nau invawi lungngaina ang chu a chungah hung tlung a tih, Ama chu naupa var nawtak a nih, A huntakah nau hung suokna hmunah a um si nawh."
"I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O death, where are thy plagues? O Sheol, where is thy destruction? repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.","Seol kuta inthawkin anni chu intlan ka ta, Thinaa inthawkin anni chu sansuok ka tih; Aw thina, i hripuihai chu khâwlai am? Aw Seol, i suksietna chu khâwlai am? Simna chu ka mita inthawkin thup nîng a tih."
"Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the breath of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness; and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.","A unauhai laia chun a tluong- tlung tak ni sien khawm, Khaw sak thli hung inthawk a ta, Thlalêra inthawka LALPA thuok ngei chu a hung mêk a nih; A tuihnârhai chu kang a ta, A tuikhurhai chu ṭâwl zo a tih; Bûr le bêl ṭhahai po po, a ro chu sukse vawng a tih."
"Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.","Samaria chu sukrêmin um a tih, A Pathien chungah a hel sih a; Kâwlhnâma sukthlûkin um an ta, An nautêhai chu peinawi nîng an tih, An nuhmei nau vawn laihai chu phirthlêr nîng an tih."
"O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.","Aw Israel, LALPA i Pathien tienga chun kîr nâwk rawh, I rîtlona lei ngei chun i tlu ta hi."
"Take with you words, and return unto Jehovah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips.","Thu chawi pumin LALPA kuom tieng kîr nâwk la, A kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril rawh, “Rîtlona po po chu la hmang la, A ṭha taphawt chu pawm la, Chuongchun, kan hmûr rahai chu, Bâwngchal aiah hung inhlân kan tih."
"Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.","Assuria chun mi sandam naw nih a, Sakawr chunghaia chun chuong nâwng kan ta, Kan kutsuokhai kuoma chun, ‘Kan Pathien in nih,’ ti ngai ta nâwng kan tih, Fahrahai chun nangmaa hin Lunginsietna an lo hmu hlak a ni sih a,” tiin."
"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.","An hnungtawlna hi sukdam ka ta, Annia inthawka ka lungin- senna chu ân kieng ta leiin, Anni chu ka hmangai hrim hrim ding a nih."
"I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.","Israel kuoma chun daidaw ang nîng ka ta, Ama chu lili angin hung vul a ta, Lebanon tlânga thing zung angin a zung thlâk dar a tih."
"His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.","A zârhai chu inbuk luoi a ta, A mawizie chu oliv thing ang el nîng a tih; Lebanon tlâng ang elin a rim inhnik a tih."
"They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.","A hlima chênghai chu hung kîr an ta, Bu ang hring thar an tih, Grêp hrui angin hung inno an ta; A rim inhnikzie chu Lebanon uoin ang nîng a tih."
"Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found.","Aw Ephraim, milimhai leh inzâwlna ieng am ka nei a?

"Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.",Tu am vara hieng hi hrethiem thei ding?

"Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.","In naupahai kuoma chun, “Ka mihai” ti unla, in farnuhai kuoma chun, “Lunginsietna dawngtu” ti ro."
"Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;","In nu hi ngên ro, ngên ro; Ama hi ka nuhmei a ni si nawh a.

"Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;","A nauhai khawm lainat naw ning, Nawchizawr nauhai an ni sih a."
"for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.","An nu chun nawchi a zawr hlak a, Anni vawntu chu inzâpuiumtakin a um a; Ka bu dâm, ka tui dâm, ka sahmul dâm, Ka pat dâm, ka hriek dâm le, ka dâwn dinghai mi petu.

"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, i lampui chu hlingin hruk ka ta, Ama dang dingin dai sak ka ta, A lampuihai chu hmu naw nih."
"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.","Chun, a dit zâwnghai chu hnawt a ta, Hnawt phâk naw nih.

"For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.","Bu dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm hi, Tangka ka sukpungpêkhai hi, Rângkachak Baal ta dinga an hmanghai leh; Keima pêk a nih ti a hriet si nawh a;"
"Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.","Chuleiin, ka bu chu a hunah, Ka uoin khawm chu a hunah la kîr nâwk ka ta, Ka sahmul le ka pat, a saruok inkhumna ding chu lâkpêk ka tih."
"And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.","Chuongchun, a dit zâwnghai mithmua chun, A saruok zâmaw chu suklang ka tih; Ka kuta inthawk chun tu- khawma sansuok naw ni hai."
"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.","A hlimna po po, a ruoiṭhe dâm, a thla thar dâm, A châwlni dâm le a hunbi ruoiṭhehai po po khawm suktâwp vawng ka tih."
"And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.","A grêp hrui le a theichang kûng, Hieng hi ka dit zâwnghai mi pêk, ka hlaw chu a nih, A ti hlakhai chu sukrêm ka tih. Ramhnuoiah siem ka ta, ramsahaiin fâng an tih."
"And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah.","Riminhnik a rawpêk hlak Baal nihai chu a chungah thung ka ta, Chuong lai chun a nabehai le a în cheinahai chu ân bel a, A dit zâwnghai a pan a, kei a mi theinghil a nih, Ti hi LALPA thu suok a nih."
"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, thlêm ka ta, thlalêrah ṭhuoi ka ta, Bau ṭhatakin ama chu bieng ka ta,"
"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.","Chu chena inthawk chun a grêp huonhai chu pêng ka ta, Akor ruom khawm beiseina kawtkhâr dingin. Chutaka chun a tleirâwl lai nihai le, Aigupta rama inthawka a hung suok ni ang khan dawn a tih."
"And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.","Chun, chu nia chun, LALPA chun a tih, Ka pasal mi tîng i ta, Ka Baal mi ti ta naw ti nih;"
"For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.",A baua inthawkin Baal hming- hai hi ka sukhmangpêk ding a ni sih a; an hming hi sâm ni ta hrim hrim naw nih.
"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.","Chu nia chun ramsahai, chung- lêng vatehai, hnuoia thilhringhai leh an ta dingin thuthlung siem ka ta; thalngulhai, kâwlhnâm dâm le indo nahai hi hnuoia inthawkin sukbo- hmang ka ta, himtakin inum hmun- khattir ka tih."
"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.","Kumkhawtluongin ka ta dingin huol tlat ka ti cheh a, felna dâm, rorêlna dâm, lunginsietna dâm, lai- natna dâmin ka ta dingin huol ka ti che."
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah.,"Ringumnain huol ka ti cheh a, chuongchun, LALPA chu hrieng i tih,"
"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;","Chu ni chun, LALPA chun a tih, Vânhai bieng ka ta, annin hnuoi bieng an tih;"
"and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.","Chun, hnuoi chun bu dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm bieng an ta; Chun, anni chun Jezreel bieng an tih."
"And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.","Chun, ama chu ka ta dingin hnuoia hin chîng ka ta, Lo-ruhama chu lainat ka ta, Ka mi nilo chu “Ka mi i nih” tîng ka ta, Chun, ama chun, “Ka Pathien i nih,” tîng a tih."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta la, nuhmei, mi dang- in an idit lai, uirenu chu va hmangai rawh, Israel thlahai chu pathien dang tieng nghain grêp bei thlum chu ngaina hai sien khawm LALPAIN a hmangai zing ang bawk hin,” a tih a."
"So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;","Chuongchun, tangka sâwm- panga le buṭei homer khat le a chenvein ama chu kân châwk a;"
"and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife: so will I also be toward thee.","chun, a kuomah, “Ni tamtak sûng chu ka ta dingin i um ding a nih, nawchi i zawr ding a ni nawh a, tu nuhmei khawm i ni bawk ding a ni nawh; chuong ang bawk chun kei khawm i kuoma chun um ka tih,” ka ta."
"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:","Israel thlahai chu ni tamtak laltak le mi lien le, inthawina le lung- phun inser, thiempu zakuo amanih, milimhai amanih, nei loin an um ding a ni sih a."
"afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear unto Jehovah and to his goodness in the latter days.","Chu hnunga chun Israel thlahai chu hnungkîr an ta, LALPA an Pathien le an laltak David chu zawng an ta; ni nuhnunghaia chun LALPA le a ṭhatna chu inthin pumin pan an tih."
"Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.","Israel thlahai, LALPA thu chu ngai ta u; Hi rama hin thutak le lunginsietna le Pathien hrietna a um naw leiin, LALPA chun ram hluotuhai hêkna ding a nei."
"There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.","Inkhâm dâm, inhlêm dâm, inthat dâm, inrûk dâm. Uiret chîng dâm a pung a, tuolthatna hlak chu ân phaman a."
"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.","Chuleiin, ram chun sûn a ta, A sûnga chêng tinrêng chu chau an tih, Ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai leh; Anih, tuisuorieta ngahai chenin lâk hmang nîng an tih."
"Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhai khawm inhêk naw raw hai se, Tukhawm inkâwk bawk naw raw hai se; I mihai chu thiempu hêktuhai ang an ni sih a, Aw thiempu, nanga chungah a nih ka lungni naw chu,"
"And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.","Sûna chun tlûng i ta, nangma leh zânah zâwlnei khawm tlûng a tih; I nu khawm sukbohmang ka tih."
"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.","Ka mihai chu hrietna tlâksam leiin sukbohmang an na, Hrietna chu i dit naw leiin kei khawma ka thiempu i ninaa inthawk chun dit naw ve tâng ka ti che. I Pathien dân chu i theinghil vei a, Kei khawmin i nauhai theinghil vêng ka tih."
"As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.","An pung dep leh ka chungah an suol tul tul a, An ropuina chu muolphonaah inchangtir ka tih,"
"They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.","Ka mihai suolna an fâk a, An khawhlonaa chun an lungril an innghat a;"
"And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.","A mipui ni leh, a thiempu ni leh angkhat nîng an tih, An lampuihai lei chun anni chu hrem ka ta, An thilthawhai chu thung ka tih."
"And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.","Fa chu fa dêng an ta, tlai si naw ni hai; Nawchizawr chîng an ta chu, pung chuong naw ni hai, LALPA pawisakna an nei naw leiin."
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.,"Nawchizawr dâm, uoin dâm, uoin thar dâm chun Hrietthiemna a lâk hmang hlak."
"My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, departing from under their God.","Ka mihai chun an thing an râwn a. An hmawl chun a hril hlak. Nawchizawrna lungril chun a ṭhuoi hmang a, An Pathiena inthawk chun an hur hmang ta sih a."
"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.","Tlâng sîphaia chun an inthâwi a, Muolhaia chun riminhnik an rawh a; Thingsaisuo le beraw le tarpin thing hnuoia chun, A hlim chu ân hawi leiin. Chuleiin, in naunuhmeihai chun nawchizawr an chîng a, In mohai chun uiret an chîng a nih."
"I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.","In naunuhmeihaiin nawchi an zawr a, In mohaiin uiret an chîng khawma hrem naw ning, Anni ngei khawm nawchi- zawrhai leh an fe pêt a, Nawchizawrhai leh an inthâwi hmunkhat sih a; Hrethiem lo mipuihai chu tlu sieng an tih."
"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth.","Israel, nang chun nawchizawr chîng la khawm, Juda chu tlu ve lul naw raw se. Gilgala chun hung naw unla, Beth-avena khawm hang fe naw ro; “LALPA a hring zing angin” tiin inkhâm bawk naw ro."
"For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.","Bâwngla kâwmaw ang elin Israelhai chu an kâwmaw a, Tuhin LALPAIN berâmte angin hmun lientakah châwm a tih."
Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.,Ephraim chun milim ân zawmpui tah a; A um umin um raw se.
Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.,"An zu dâwn chu an ṭîn a, nawchizawrah an insiem a, An ropuina nêkin thil inzapuium chu an ngaina lem a."
The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.,Thli chun a thlahai chun a tuom khum tah a; An inthâwinahai lei chun lân zak ngei an tih.
"Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.","Aw nangni thiempuhai, hi hi lo hre ta u, Nangni Israel sûnghai, lo ngai ta u, Aw laltak sûnghai, na lo sit ta u, Rorêlna chu nangni ta ding a ni sih a; Mizpaa châng le, Tabor tlânga lên zar in ni leiin."
And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.,"Mi helhai chun sukhlum hi an uor êm êm a, Kei ruok chu an rênga kâwktu ka nih."
"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.","Ephraim chu ka hriet a, Israel chu keimaa thup a ni nawh, Tuhin, aw Ephraim, nawchizawr i chîng leiin, Israel chu sukpawrche a na;"
"Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah.","An Pathien tienga nghakîr dingin, An thil thaw hlakhai chu an bânsan nawh a; Nawchizawr lungril anni lai a um sih a, LALPA chu an hriet naw a nih."
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.,"Israel sawngtawlawi chun a hmai sanah ân hriettir a, Chuongchun, Ephraim le Israel chu an khawhlonaa chun tlûng an ta; Juda khawm anni lai tlu vêng a tih."
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.,"An berâm ruolhai le an bâwng ruolhai leh, LALPA zawng dingin fêng an ta; Nisienlakhawm, ama chu hmu nâwng an tih, An kuoma inthawkin ân siekieng tah a nih."
They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.,LALPA chungah vervêktakin an thaw a nih; Hnam dang nauhai an nei sih a; Thla thar chun an lohma chen leh bohmangna intlun a tih.
"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.","Gibea khuoa chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, Rama khuoa chun tawtawrâwt mût ro; Beth-avena chun khêk rak rak unla, Aw Benjamin, i hnung tieng kha!"
Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.,"Ephraim chu hremna nia chun sukrêm nîng a ta, Thil hung ni ngei ding chu Israelhai laia chun kân hriettir tah a nih."
The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.,"Juda mi lienhai chu ramri sawntuhai an na, An chungah ka lunginsenna chu tui angin bunthlâng ka tih."
"Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after man’s command.","Ephraim chu thupêk zâwm a nuom vieu leiin, Nêksâwrin a um a, rorêlna chu suksietin a um a nih."
"Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.","Chuleiin, Ephraim ta ding chun hângthim ang ka na, Juda sûngkuohai ta ding chun hmawnna ang ka nih."
"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.","Ephraim chun a natna a hmuh a, Juda chun a hliem a hmuh a, Chuongchun, Ephraim chu Assuria kuomah a feh a, Laltak Jareb kuoma chun mi a tir a; Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a sukdam thei naw cheu a, In hliemna chu a sukdampêk thei bawk naw cheu."
"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.","Ephraim ta ding chun sakeibaknei ang, Juda ta ding chun sakeibaknei vânglai ang ka ni ding a ni sih a; Keima, keima ngeiin keithlêr ka ta, Fêng ka ta, fe hmangpui ka tih; Sansuoktu ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."
"I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.","An thiemnawzie an inhriet a, ka hmêl an zawng hma chun, Fêng ka ta, ka hmunah kîr nâwk ka tih; An tuornaa chun mi zawng an ta, hieng hin tîng an tih:"
"Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.","“Hung ta u, LALPA kuomah kîr ei tiu, A mi kei nâwi taha chu a mi lo sukdam nâwk ding a ni sih a, A mi lo vuok ta nâka chu a mi tuom nâwk ding a ni sih a;"
"After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.","Ni hni chenah mi sukhring a ta, Ni thum nia chun mi keitho a ta, a hmaah um ei tih."
"And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.","LALPA hrietna chu hnawt pei ei tiu khai, hrieng ei tiu; Zîng khawvar anga inkhêl ruol loin ân thawk suok ngei hlak; Ei kuomah ruo angin, ruo nuhnung, hnuoi sukhutu ang elin hung tlung a tih,” tiin."
"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away.","Aw Ephraim, iengtin am ka thaw ding che a na? Aw Juda, iengtin am ka thaw ding che a na? In ṭhatna chu zîngkâr ṭieusûm le daidaw hung bo vak hlak ang hi a ni sih a."
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.,"Chuleiin, zâwlneihai hmangin anni ka râwt a, Ka baua thuhaiin anni ka sukhlum a nih. I chunga rorêlnahai chu var fe suok pup pup ang hi a nih."
"For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.",Inthâwina dit loin lunginsietna ka dit sih a; Pumrawhmang thilinhlân nêk chun Pathien hrietna ka dit lem a nih.
But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.,"Nisienlakhawm, Adam angin thuthlung chu an bawsiet a, Chutaka chun vervêktakin ka chungah an thaw a nih:"
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.,Gilead chu khawhlona thawtuhai khawpui a na; Thisen a kai pheng phung a nih.
"And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.","Suomhmang ruolin mi an inchân hlak angin, Thiempu pâwlhai chun Sekem lampuiah mi an that hlak; Anih, thil suol an thaw tah a nih."
"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.","Israel sûngkuoa chun thil râpthlâktak ka hmuh a, Ephraima chun nawchizawrna a um a, Israel chu sukpawrchein a um a nih."
"Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.","Ka mihai sal intângnaa inthawka ka ṭhuoi kîr pha chun, Aw Juda, i ta ding khawma ra sîk ding ruot a nih."
"When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.","Israel sukdam ka tum leh Ephraim khawhlona a hung inlang a. Samaria rîtlona leh, hlêm an chîng a nih. Sûng tieng inru a hung lût a, Tuol tienga chun suomhmang ruolin an suom sih a,"
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.,"An rîtlona po po chu ka hriet zing ti An lungrilin an ngaituo nawh; Tuhin chu an thilthawhai ngeiin a chîm vêl tlat tah a, Ka hmaihma ngeiah an um a nih."
"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.",An rîtlona chun laltak an suklâwm a; An thu khêlin mi lienhai an suklâwm bawk a.
"They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.","An rêngin uire an na, Bei siemtuin thuk a ur lum, Beiphit a hmethnâk a tho hmaa, Mei tâwl a châwlsan hri ang hi an nih."
On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.,"Ei laltak nia chun mi lienhai chu uoin inruitakin an insukrui a, Ama chun hmusittuhai ruolin a kut a phar a."
"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.","Inrûka an inchân laiin an lungril chu thuk ang elin an siem tah a; An lunginsen chu zânkhawvârin a dei a, Zîngkâr chun meichawk angin a hung chawk a."
"They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.","Thuk ang elin an sa vawng a, an rorêltuhai an sukbohmang a; An laltak taphawthai chu an tluh a, Anni lai tukhawm a mi ko an um nawh."
"Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.","Ephraim hlak chu hnam danghai lai ân zêlsa a, Ephraim chu bei inlet lo a nih."
"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.","Mikhuolhai chun a hrâtna an fâk zopêk a, Ama chun chu a hriet nawh; Hmul inṭuokin ama chu a bâwm nuol tah a, Ama chun chu a hriet nawh."
"And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this.","Israel chapona chun ama thiemnawzie ân hriettir a, Nisienlakhawm, hieng po poa khawm hin, LALPA an Pathien tieng chu an ngha nawh a, Ama chu an zawng bawk nawh,"
"And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.","Ephraim chu vaṭhu inhai, hrietthiemna nei lo ang a lo na, Aigupta tieng an ko vak a, Assuria tienga chun an fe vak a;"
"When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.","An fe chu an chungah ka lên hei dêng ka ta, Chunglêng vate man angin man ka tih; An thil suol thaw ang huin anni hrem ka tih."
"Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.","An chung a rik ie; ka kuoma inthawkin an fe hmang ta sih a! Bohmangna an chungah a tlung ie, ka chungah an hel ta sih a! Kei chun anni sandam ka nuom a, Anni ruok chun khêl an mi hril khum a,"
"And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.","An lungril takin an mi ko nawh a, An khum laizâwlah an chierinthluok mei mei a nih; Bu le uoin dingin an inkhâwm a, ka chunga chun an hel sih a."
"Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.","Kei chun an bânhai chu inchûktirin ka sukhrât a, Nisienlakhawm, ka chungah thil ṭha naw an suongtuo a nih."
"They return, but not to him that is on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.","An ngha kîr a, Achunghnungtak kuomah ni loin; Thalngul rul ang an nih, An mi lienhai chu an ṭawng pâwngpawr leiin kâwlhnâmin tlûng an tih; Hi hi Aigupta rama nuizatbûr an nina nîng a tih."
"Set the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle he cometh against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.","Tawtawrâwt chu i hmûrah inbûk rawh; LALPA sûnghai chungah mupui angin a hung ie; Ka thuthlung an bawsiet a, Ka dân an helsan leiin."
"They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.","“Ka Pathien, keini Israelhai hin chu kan hriet che,” Tiin ka kuomah an khêk a."
Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.,Israelhai chun thil ṭha chu an hnâwl a; Hmêlma chun anni hnawt a tih.
"They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.","Ka thaw ni loin, annîn lal an siem a, Ka hriet loin hotuhai an siem a; An bohmangna dingin an tang- karuo le an rângkachakin milim an siem a."
"He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?","Aw Samaria, i sebâwngte lim chu a hnâwl ie; An chungah ka lunginsen êm êm a nih. Nun tluongtlama an um thei hma chu ieng chen tak am a ni ding chu."
"For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.","Israela inthawk chun hi hi a ni sih a, Sinthawtu siem a na, Pathien a ni nawh; Anih, Samaria sebâwngte lim chu suknâwi vawng nîng a tih."
"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.","Thli an chîng a, thli sie an sîk ding a ni sih a, Kûng ngîr a nei nawh a, a zîk khawm chun ra insuo naw ni; Insuo khawm ni sienla, mikhuolhaiin fa zo an tih."
Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.,"Israelhai chu lem zoin an um a nih, Bêl, a sûnga lâwmna um lo angin tuhin hnam dang laia chun an um a nih."
"For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.",Ram sabengtung khât tla angin Assuria ramah an hang fe sih a; Ephraim chun dit zâwnghai a tlawn ie!
"Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.","Anih, hnam danghai laia chun intlawn chîng sienla khawm, Tuhin anni chu kei khâwm ka tih, Lal le hotuhai rikphur leiin an kiem ṭan a nih."
"Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning.","Ephraim chun mâichâm a sukpung hi an thil suksuolna chau a na, An ta dingin mâichâm hrim hrim chu suolna el a nih."
I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.,"Ka dân chu ka ziekpêk rei rui a, Nisienlakhawm, thil dang takah an ngai a nih."
"As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.","Ka ta dinga inthawina thilinhlânhai chu! Sa an inhlân a, an fâk a; chuong chu LALPAIN a pawm nawh. Chuongchun, an rîtlona hre zing a ta, an suol hrem a ta, Anni chu Aigupta ramah kîr nâwk an tih."
"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.","Israel chun a siemtu a theinghil a, In ropuihai a bâwl a; Juda chun khawpui kul neihai a sukpung a; Nisienlakhawm, a khawpuihaia chun mei tir ka ta, A in ropuihai chu kâng zo a tih."
"Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, departing from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.","Aw Israel, lâwm naw ta, Hnam danghai angin hlim so luom naw rawh; I Pathien chu nawchi i zawr san a, Hrizâwl tina chun nawchizawr ruoi man chu i ngaina sih a."
"The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.","Hrizâwl le grêp sâwrna khurhai chun anni suktlai naw nih a, Uoin thar ding hlawsam a tih."
"They shall not dwell in Jehovah’s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.","LALPA rama chun chêng naw ni hai a, Ephraim chu Aigupta tieng kîr lem a tih; Assuria rama chun bu thieng naw fâng an tih."
"They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.","LALPA kuomah uoin chu bun suok nâwng an ta, An thilinhlânhai chu a ta dingin lâwmum ni bawk nâwng a tih; An bei chu lusûnhai bu ang nîng a ta, A fa taphawthai chu sukpawrche nîng an tih. An bei chu an hringna ta ding chau nîng a ta, LALPA inah hunglût naw nih."
"What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?","Inkhâwmpui ursûntak nia le, LALPA ruoiṭhe nia chun ieng am thaw tâng in ta?"
"For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.","Ngai ta u, sietna chu an mâksan a, Aigupta chun anni chu lo kei khâwm lem a tih, Memphis chun lo phûm a tih; An tangkaruo thil ditumhai chu zakthlaiin bâwm a ta, An puon inhaia chun hlo hlingnei um a tih,"
"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.","Hremna nihai chu a hung tlung a, Thungna nihai chu a hung tlung ie! Israel chun chu chu hrieng a ta; I rîtlona chu a tamin intaina a tam leiin. Zâwlnei chu ân vêt a, thlarau nei mi chu mi invêt a nih."
"Ephraim was a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God.","Ephraim râl vêngtu chu ka Pathien kuoma um a na, Zâwlnei hlak chu a lampui intluonin chângkamtu châng kam a um a; A Pathien ina khawm intaina a um."
"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.","Gibea khuoa umlai nihai ang khan, Nasatakin anni le anni an insukkhawhlo a; An rîtlona chu hre zing a ta, An suolnahai chu thung a tih."
"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.","Israel chu thlalêra grêp ra ang elin ka hmuh a, In pahai chu, theichang hun hmasaa a hmin hmasa angin ka hmuh. Nisienlakhawm, anni chu Baalpeor hmunah an hung a. Thil inzakumtaka chun an inpumpêk tah a; An ingainat tak ang bawk chun tirdak an um ve ta a nih."
"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.","Ephraim ropuina chu vate angin vuong hmang a ta, Nau nei dâm, nau vawn dâm, inrai dâm um naw ni hai."
"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!","An nauhai hung sukpuitling hai sien khawm, pasal hrim um lo dingin, Insûntir tho tho ka tih; Anih, anni ka nghatsan pha chun, An chung a va rik zuol âwm de!"
"Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.","Tura ka hmu ang bawkin, Ephraim chu hmun inhawitaka siein a um a, Nisienlakhawm, Ephraim chun a nauhai chu thattu kuomah la ṭhuoi a tih."
"Give them, O Jehovah—what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.","Aw LALPA, inneitir rawh. Ieng am inneitir i ta? Sul nau insiet hlak le, nêne vuoihai chu inneitir rawh."
All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.,An rîtlona po po chu Gilgal khuoah a um a; Chutaka chun anni chu ka theida sih a. An thilthaw rîtlona lei chun ka ina inthawkin hnawt suok ka tih; Annirawi hi hmangai ta naw ning; An hotuhai po po chu hel hmang an ni sih a.
"Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.","Ephraim chu vuokin a um a, an zung chu a vuoi zo tah, Ra insuo naw ni hai; Anih, insuo hai sien khawm, an sul ra ditumtak chu That tho tho ka tih."
"My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.","Ka Pathien chun anni chu peihâwn a tih. Ama an ngaisak naw leiin; Chuongchun, hnam danghai lai chun invâiin um an tih."
