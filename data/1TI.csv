"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;","Paula, Pathien a mi Sandamtu le Krista Isu ei Beiseina ruot anga Krista Isu Tirko chun;"
"unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.","Ringnaa ka nau taktak Timothe kuomah: Pathien ei Pa le, ei Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna dâm, zângaina dâm, inremna dâm hung um raw se."
"As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,","Makedonia rama ka fe ding laia Ephesia um zing dinga ka ngên che ang khan, mi ṭhenkhathai chu inchûktirna danglam hrim inchûktir lo dinga i kâwk theina ding le,"
"neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; so do I now.",tienami mei mei le sui sêng lo thlatuhai thu (ringnaa Pathien khawsakzie um hi sukṭhat nêka insêlna siem lem hlaktu chu) ngaisak lo dinga kâwk dingin tu khawm hin ka la ngên rawp che a nih.
But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:,"Nisienlakhawm, kâwkna san chu lungril inthieng le, sie le ṭha hrietna inthieng le, ringna taktaka inthawka hung suok hmangaina chu an nei theina dingin a nih;"
from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;,"mi ṭhenkhathai an fe kâwi leiin chu chu an pêtsan a, thu teplo hrilna tieng an fe ta lem a."
"desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.","An thu hril umzie le ngamtaka an thu hril chanchin chu hre si loin, Dân inchûktirtuhai ni an nuom hlak a nih."
"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,","Dân chu a ṭha ti ei hriet sih a, miin a hmang ṭha phawt chun."
"as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,","Hieng hi hre hai sienla, “Dân hi mi feltak ta dinga siem a ni nawh a, dân pawisa nawhai le dân bawsiehai ta ding dâm, mi inthieng nawhai le Pathien inzâ nawhai ta ding dâm, pahai thattuhai le nuhai thattuhai ta ding dâmin,"

"I thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to his service;","A mi sukhrâttu Krista Isu ei Lalpa kuoma chun lâwmthu ka hril a nih; ringumah a mi ngai a, a rawng- bâwltuah a mi ruot ta leiin."
"though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;","Inhma chun hrilsetu le suknawm- natu le sawisatu ni lang khawm, awi naw puma hre loa thaw ka ni leiin zângaina chu ka hmu a nih;"
and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.,chun ei Lalpa lunginsietna chu ringna le Krista Isu hmangainain nasatakin a liem tah a.
"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:","“Krista Isu mi suolhai sandam dingin khawvêla hin a hung,” ti hi ring a umin, pawm tlâk tak a nih; anni laia mi suol tak ka ni hi."
"howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.","Nisienlakhawm, hi lei hin a nih, zângaina ka hmu chu, Isu Krista chun mi suol tak keimaa hin a daw- theizie po po ân langtir theina dingin, tuta chen chu chatuon hringna hmu dinga ama la hung awi dinghai khîkhmûna dingin."
"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.","Laltak chatuona um, se thei lo, hmu thei lo Pathien tak chau chu chatuona chawimawi le ropuiin um raw se. Amen."
"This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare;","Ka nau Timothe, inhmaa i chanchin an hril lâwk thuhai ang khan chu kâwkna thu chu kân kawltir che; chuong le chun, indona ṭha chu i do theina dingin;"

"I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;","Chuongchun, a tîrtakin thil hni ṭawngṭaina dâm, ṭawngṭaina hrim hrim dam, ṭawngṭaipêkna dâm, lâwmthu hrilna dâm mi po po ta dinga siempêk dingin kân fui che:"

"For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus,","Pathien le mihriem inkârah Palai pakhat chau a um bawk a; ama chu mihriem, Krista Isu,"

"I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.","Chuongchun, pasalhaiin hmun tinah kut inthieng pharin, lunginsen lo le insêl loin ṭawngṭai hai sienla ka nuom a nih."
"In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;","Chuong ang bawkin, nuhmeihai khawm silfên mâwl tak leh, inchei taluo loin, thuom inchawi tâwkin inthuom hai sienla, sam phierin amanih, rângkachakin amanih, lung- hluin amanih, puon man tamtakhaiin amanih inchei loin."
but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.,"Amiruokchu, nuhmei Pathien ngaisak intihai chu inphu tâwkin thil thaw ṭhatin inchei hai sien ka nuom."
Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.,Nuhmeiin thu awi tlatin to zingin inchûk raw hai se.
"But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.",Nuhmeiin a inchûktir chu phal a ni nawh; pasal chunga thu an nei ka phal bawk nawh; to zingin um lem raw hai se.
"For Adam was first formed, then Eve;","Adam chu siem hmasak a na, chu hnunga chun Evi chu siem a ni sih a."
"and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:","Chun, Adam chu hlêmin a um nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu hlêmin a um a, bawsietnaah a tlu tah a."
"but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.","Nisienlakhawm, nuhmei chu ringna le hmangaina le, inthiengna neia lungril feltak puta a um chun, nau nei leiin sandamin um a tih."
"Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.","“Tûkhawm Kohran hotua ṭhang a nuom chun, sinthaw ṭha a nuom a nih,” ti hi ân dik a nih."
"The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach;","Chuongchun, kohran hotu chu sawisêlbo, nuhmei pakhat nei, insûm thei, lungril indiktak, mi fel, mi lâwm dân thiem, inchûktir dân thiem,"
"no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;","uoin inrui hmang naw, mi vuo hmang naw, mi nunnêmtak ni lem ding, mi kâwmaw ni lo, tangka sum ngaina naw mi,"
"one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;","inzaumtaka mâni nauhai thu- nuna, mâni insûng khawsak rêl fel thiem mi a ni ding a nih;"
"(but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)","(miin mâni insûng khawsak hman a rêl fel thiem naw chun, Pathien kohran iengtin am enkawl a ta?)"
"not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.","Ringthar a ni ding a ni nawh a, chuong naw chun, chapoin um a ta, Diebol thiemnaw changna chu chang ve rawi a tih."
Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.,"Chuong naw khawm chu, puo- tienga mihai inpâkin a um bawk ding a nih; chuong naw chun, hrilsieta umin diebol chângah âwk rawi a tih."
"Deacons in like manner must be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;","Chuong ang bawkin, kohran rawngbâwltuhai chu mi inzaum an ni ding a nih; bâutam dâm, uoin he dâm, hlêpna inthieng nawa duâm mi an ni ding a ni nawh;"
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.,sie le ṭha hrietna inthienga ring- na thurûk chu pawm mi an ni lem ding a nih.
"And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless.","Chun, chuonghai khawm chu infiein um hmasa raw hai se, chu hnunga sawisêlbo an lo ni chun, ko- hran rawngbâwl tieng sin thaw raw hai se."
"Women in like manner must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.","Chuong ang bawkin nuhmeihai khawm mi inzâum an ni ding a nih; hêktuhai ni loin, insûm thei le iengkima ringum an ni ding a nih."
"Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.",Kohran rawngbâwltuhai chu an nauhai le anni insûng khawsak rêl felin nuhmei pakhat nei mi ni raw hai se.
"For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.","Kohran rawngbâwl tieng sin thaw ṭha tahai chun, ngîrna ṭha tak le, Krista Isu ringna kawnga chun huoina nasatak an insiem hlak sih a."
"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly;",Sâwt nawtê hnunga i kuoma hung beiseiin hieng thu hi i kuomah ka ziek a nih.
"but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.","Nisienlakhawm, ka la um sâwt tâk duoiin Pathien sûnghai laia mi iengtin am an um ding ti i hriet theina dingin ka ziek a nih; Pathien sûnghai chu Pathien hring kohran, thutak ban le innghatna chu an nih."
"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; He who was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the spirit, Seen of angels, Preached among the nations, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.","Chun, Pathien ngaisakna thu- rûk chu sêl ruol loin a ropui a nih: “Ama, tisaa hung inlang, Thlaraua thiem chang, Vântirkohai ihmu, Hnamhai laia tlânginsampui, Khawvêla mihai iawi, Ropuinaa zuk ṭhuoi ta chu,”"
"But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,","Nisienlakhawm, Thlarau chun chiengtakin a hril: nakie pha chun mi ṭhenkhathai chun ṭhuoi hmangna thlarauhai le khawhrihai inchûktirna thu ngaisakin ringna chu la bânsan an tih, mi khêlhliphai vervêkna leiin ti hi."
"through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;","Chuong mi khêlhliphai chu anni sie le ṭha hrietna ngeia thîr linga bel ang an na,"
"forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.","innei an khap hlak a, iengkhat fâk dinghai (thutak hrea ringtuhai lâwmthu hrila pawm dinga Pathienin a isiemhai chu) fâk naw ding an ti hlak."
"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:","Pathien thilsiem tinrêng hi a ṭha sih a, lâwmthu hrila pawm a ni taphawt chun iengkhawm dit naw ding a ni nawh,"
for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.,Pathien thu le ṭawngṭainain sukthieng a ni ta sih a.
"If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now:","Chuonghai chu unauhai în hriettir chun, Krista Isu rawng- bâwltu ṭhatak nîng i tih, ringna le inchûktirna ṭha tu chena i la zâwm thuah châwm i ni ang khan."
but refuse profane and old wives’ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:,"Amiruokchu, Pathien inza nâw- na le pitarhai tienami thu mei mei chu dit naw rawh. Chun, Pathien ngaisak dingin insawizawi rawh."
"for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.","Taksa insawizawina hi ṭhahnem chu a ṭhahnem ve bawk a, Pathien ngaisakna ruok hin chu, hringna tuta umsa le la hung um ding pêk tiemna a nei leiin kawng tinrêngah a ṭhahnem a nih."
"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.",Hi thu hi ring a umin pawm tlâk bêk bêk a nih.
"For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.","Chuongchun, Pathien hring chu ei awi leiin sin ei inrim a; ei thaw hrâm hrâm a nih, ama chu mi po po sandamtu a na, ama ringtuhai sandamtu a ni bîk tak a nih."
These things command and teach.,"Chuong thu chu pe la, inchûktir rawh."
"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.","I naupangna tûkhawmin ngai- nêp naw raw hai seh, thu hril kawnga dâm, chângzie kawnga dâm, hmangaina kawnga dâm, ringna kawnga dâm, inthiengna kawnga dâm, ringtuhai sukhmutu ni lem raw khai."
"Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.","Ka hung hmakhat chu tiem dâm, thu hril dâm, inchûktir dâm thaw rawh."
"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.","Nangmaa um, thilpêk hril lâwk ta anga, upahai kut innghata, Pathienin ân neitir che kha thla- thlam naw."
Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.,"Mi po po kuomah i ṭhathnemna ân lang theina dingin chuongahai chun taima la, chuonga chun in- hmang zo rawh."
"Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.","Nangma le i inchûktirnaa chun fimkhur la, chuong thilhai chu thawin um zing rawh; chuong anga thawin nangma le i thu ngaituhai chu i sandam ding a nih."
"Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:","Putar deuhai chu hal naw la, pa angin thlêm lem rawh; tlang- lakhai chu unau angin;"
"the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.","pitar deuhai chu nu angin, nunghâkhai chu inthiengtakin farnu angin."
Honor widows that are widows indeed.,"Hmeithai, hmeithai taktakhai chu chawimawi rawh."
"But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.","Nisienlakhawm, hmeithai tû- khawmin nauhai amanih, tuhai amanih nei sienla, chuonghai chun anni insûng tienga Pathien ngaisaka um dân le, anni keitleituhai chunga ṭhatzie inchûk zet raw hai se; chu chu Pathien lâwm zâwng a ni sih a."
"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.","Hmeithai taktak mâkhât chaua um chun Pathien chungah beiseina a nei tlat a, a sûn a zânin hni le ṭawng- ṭaiin a um rawp hlak."
But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.,"Nisienlakhawm, hmeithai mâni inhawitirna ngawta inpe chu, a dam lai khawm a thi a nih."
"These things also command, that they may be without reproach.",Sawisêlboa an um theina dingin chuong thu khawm chu pe rawh.
"But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin mâ- ni mihai ta ding a ngaituo lâwk naw a, mâni insûnga mihai ta ding hman a ngaituo lâwk naw chun, ringna chu ân phat san a, awi naw mi nêkin a suol lem a nih."
"Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,","Hmeithaihai kum sâwmruk chen hnuoi tieng ni loa, mi pakhat nuhmei lo ni ta chu hmeithaia ziek thei a nih-"
"well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.","thil ṭha thaw kawnga mi inpâka um tah, nauhai lo châwm tlei taa, mikhuolhai lo intlungtir taa, mi inthienghai ke lo sâwp taa; lungin- zînghai lo sawmdâwl taa, thil ṭha tinrêng taimataka a lo thaw ta phawt chun."
"But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;","Hmeithai la nunghâk deuhai chu ziek nuom naw rawh; Krista tieng an det nawin, pasal nei an nuom hlak sih a;"
"having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.",an thutiem hmasa chu an bawsiet hlak leiin thiemnaw changin an um hlak a nih.
"And withal they learn also to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.","Chu naw khawm chu, in tinah an lêng lâwr a, thabo khawm an chîng hlak a, thabo chau khawm ni loin, thu hril naw ding ding hrilin, bau tam le mihai thil thaw dempêk an hmang bawk a nih."
"I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling:","Chuongchun, hmeithai la nu- nghâk deuhai chu pasal nei hai sienla, nauhai nei sienla, insûng khawsak rel hai sienla, sawisêlna ding remchâng hrim hmêlma chu inhmutir naw hai sienla ka nuom a nih."
for already some are turned aside after Satan.,Tu khawm hin mi ṭhenkhat chu Setana tieng panin an pêt hmang ta sih a.
"If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.","Ringtu nuhmeiin hmeithaihai kawl nei sienla, amain sawmdâwl raw se; Kohran chu sukbuoiin um naw raw se, hmeithai taktakhai chu an sawmdâwl theina dingin."
"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.",Kohran upa ro rêl ṭhahai chu a lêt hnia chawimawi tlâka ngai ni raw hai se; thu hril le inchûktirna kawnga sininrimhai chu chawimawi tlâka ngai nâwk zuol ni raw hai se.
"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his hire.","Pathien Lekha Thu chun, “Sebâwng chalin bu a chîl laiin a hmûr khit naw rawh,” a tih a. “Sinthawtu chu a hlaw hmu tlâk a nih,” a ti bawk a."
"Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.","Kohran upa an hêkna chu hretu pahni amanih, pathum amanih baua inthawk naw chu pawm naw."
"Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.",Thil suksuoltuhai chu mi po po hmaah kâwk rawh; mi dang khawma an ṭi ve theina dingin.
"I charge thee in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.","Hieng thu hi thlier bîk nei loin, thlier bîk neia iengkhawm thaw loin, Pathien le Krista Isu le Vântirko thlanghai mithmuin zâwm dingin ṭhahnemngaitakin kân hriettir che."
"Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.","Tû chunga khawm kut innghat thut naw la, mi dang suolnahaia chun ṭhang bawk naw; insukthieng zing rawh."
"Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.","Tui chau dâwn mi ni ta naw la, i phîng lei le i damnaw rawp leiin uoin tlâwmtê hmang hlak rawh."
"Some men’s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.","Mi ṭhenkhat suolhai chu ân lang zing a, rorêlna chu a tlung hmasa hlak; mi ṭhenkhat suol chun an hnungah a zui lem hlak."
In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.,"Chuong ang bawkin thil thaw ṭhat ân lang zing chi a um a, chuong ang nawhai khawm chu thup thei a ni nawh."
"Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed.","Pathien hming le a închûktirna thu hrilsieta a um nâwna dingin, suok rîngkawl bât taphawthai chun anni puhai iengkimah chawimawi tlâkah ngai raw hai se."
"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort.","Chun, ringtu pu neihai chun, unau an ni leiin ngainêp naw raw hai se; amiruokchu, ṭhathnemna hmutu- hai chu ringtu le dittakhai an ni leiin an rawng bâwlpêk zuol lem raw hai se. Hieng thu hi inchûktir la, infui rawh."
"If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;","Mi tûkhawmin inchûktirna dang ân chûktir a, thutak (Ei Lalpa Isu Krista thu) le, Pathien ngaisakna inchûktirna tieng a awi naw chun,"
"he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,","ama chu a chapo a, iengkhawm a hriet nawh a, hriet nêk hmanin insêl le thu kal kawnga chun ân vêt ta lem a nih. Chuonga inthawk chun, inhnarna dâm, insuolna dâm, hril- sietna dâm, a ṭha naw tieng ringna dâm a hung suok a,"
"wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.","lungril sie nei le thutak nei naw mi nina, sêlhrâtna dâm a suok hlak; chuonghai chu, Pathien ngaisak hi hlâwkna amanih titu an nih."
But godliness with contentment is great gain:,Pathien ngaisak hi lungawina ṭhang chun hlâwkna nasatak a ni hrim a nih.
"for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;","Khawvêla hin iengkhawm ei lûtpui nawh a, iengkhawm ei suokpui thei bawk nawh."
but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.,"Nisienlakhawm, fâk ding le sil ding neiin, chuonga chun lungawi ei tih."
"But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.","Amiruokchu, hausak tumtuhai chu thlêmnaa dâm, chânga dâm, invêtthlâk le sukkhawhlo thei inhâwkna tamtaka dâm an tlu lût a, chuong inhâwknahai chun sietna le bohmangnaah mi a suktlum hlak."
"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.","Tangka sum ngainat hi suol tinrêng bul a ni sih a; chu chu ṭhenkhatin an inhnar a, ringna chu an fe hmang san a, anni le anni lungngaina tamtakin an insun tlang ta nghuon a."
"But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.","Nisienlakhawm, nang Pathien mi, chuong thilhai chu tlânsan la, felna dâm, Pathien ngaisakna dâm, ringna dâm, hmangaina dâm, daw- theina dâm, thuhnuoirawlna dâm hnawt pei rawh."
"Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.","Ringna inruolsiekna ṭha chu thaw la, chatuon hringna chu chel rawh; chu chu chang dinga ko i na, hretu tamtakhai mithmuah ṭanna ṭha chu i ṭan ta kha."
"I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;","Pathien thil tinrêng sukhringtu le, Krista Isu, Pontia Pilat hmaa ṭanna ṭha ṭantu mithmua chun, thu ka pêk che;"
"that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:",ei Lalpa Isu hung inlar nâwk hmakhat chu thupêk kha sawisêlbo le inthiengtaka pawm dingin.
"which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;","Chu inlârna chu a hun taka chun inpâktlâk thuneitu tak chau, laltakhai laltak, lalhai lal chun inentir a ti che."
"who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power eternal.
