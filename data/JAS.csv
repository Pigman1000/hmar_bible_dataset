"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.","Jakob, Pathien le Isu Krista suokin, Hnam sâwm le pahni indarhai chu chibai a bûk."
"Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;","Ka unauhai, thlêmna tinrêng in tuok hnungin lâwmna ruokah ngai ro,"
knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.,in ringna fiena chun selna a siem ti hrein.
"And let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.","Chun, iengkhawm tlasam loa in famkima, in puma in him theina ding- in, selna chun thaw famkim raw se."
"But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.","Nangni laia tûkhawmin varna a tlasam chun, mi po po kuoma hal lo le inro loa pe hlaktu Pathien chu hni raw se; chuongchun, a kuomah pêk nîng a tih."
"But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.","Nisienlakhawm, ringhla hlek loin, ringna neiin hni raw se, ring- hlatu chu tuisuoriet fâwn thli imût lêng le vawr ang a ni sih a."
For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;,"Chuong ang mi chun Lalpa kuomah iengkhawm hmu inring naw raw se,"
"a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.","mi lungril bulbâl nei naw, a thil thaw po poa det naw mi chun."
But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:,Unau daikilkâra mi chu chawi- mawia a um leiin lâwm raw se.
"and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.",Hausa ruok chu suktlâwma a um leiin lâwm lem raw se; hlohna pâr angin a la bo el ding a ni sih a.
"For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.","Nisa a hung suok a, thli lumtak a hung hrângin, hlo chu a sukvuoi a; chun a pâr chu a rêm a, a um dân mawizie chu a bohmang hlak; chuong ang bawkin mi hausa chu a fenaa chun a la vuoi ding a ni sih a."
"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.","Thlêmna tuor hrâm hrâmtu chu a hamṭha, fiea a um phâleh hringna lallukhum Lalpain ama hmangai- tuhai kuoma a tiem chu a hmu ding a ni si."
"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:","Tûkhawmin thlêmna an tuok laiin, “Pathien ithlêm ka nih,” ti naw raw hai se; Pathien chu suol ithlêm ruol a ni nawh, ama khawmin tûkhawm a thlêm ngai nawh."
"but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.","Mi tin mâni châknaa ṭhuoi hmang le hîpa an um chun, thlêmna an tuok lem a nih."
"Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.","Chun, châkna chun tê a vawn a, suol a nei hlak; chun, suol chun a hung puitlingin thina a hung suksuok hlak."
"Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.","Ka unau dittakhai, hlêmin um naw ro."
"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.","Thilpêk ṭha le thilpêk famkim po po chu chung tienga inthawkin, varhai Pa kuoma inthawkin a hung ṭum hlak a nih, amaa chun dang- lamna le inherna hlim hrim hrim a um thei nawh."
"Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.",A thilsiemhai hma ṭhuoitu ang ei lo ni theina dingin ama dit zâwngin thutaka inthawkin a mi nei a nih.
"Ye know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:","Unau dittakhai, chuong chu in hriet; nisienlakhawm, mi tinin ngai inchu sienla, thu hril inchu loin, lungril sukuoi raw se;"
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.,mihriem lunginsenna chun Pathien felna chu a siem si nawh.
"Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.","Chuleiin, inthieng nawna po po le suol sip liem chu sie hmang unla, thu tu, in thlarau sandam thei chu thuhnuoirawl takin pawm ro."
"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.","Nisienlakhawm, mâni inhlêm a, thu ngaituhai chau ni loin, thu zâwmtuhai lo ni lem ro."
"For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:","Tûkhawm thu ngaitu nia, zâwmtu ni si lo chu, mi hlimenah a hmai pienpui nguntaka inen ang chu a nih."
"for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.","Nguntakin ân en a, a fe hmang a, mi ieng ang am a ni a theinghil nâwk si hlak a."
"But he that looketh into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.","Amiruokchu, tûkhawm dân famkim, zalênna dân hi bia, chuong anga um zinga, ngaia theinghil nâwk el hlaktu ni loa, zâwma sin thaw rawptu ni lem chu, ama chu a thil thawah malsâwmin um a tih."
"If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man’s religion is vain.","Tûkhawm sakhaw ngaisak nia inringa, a lei vêng ṭha si loa, mâni lungrila inhlêm lemtu chu, chu mi sakhaw biek dân chu iengkhawm a ni nawh."
"Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.","Ei Pathien le Pa mithmua sakhaw biek dân inthieng le, suol ṭhang naw chu hi hi a nih, fahra le hmeithaihai an rimsik laia kan le, khawvêl inthieng nawna kai loa in- siem hi."
"My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.","Ka unauhai, ei Lalpa Isu Krista, Ropuina Lalpa, ring si chun mi thlier bîk nei naw ro."
"For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;","In inkhâwmna inah mi râng- kachak kutsebi bun, puon mawitak sil hung lût sienla, chun, pasie puon setak sil hung lût bawk sienla,"
"and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;","puon mawitak sil chu in ngaisak a, a kuoma chun, “Nang hi hmun ṭhaa hin ṭhung rawh,” in tih a; chun, pasie kuoma chun, “Nang chu sawtaka sawn ngîr la, annawleh ka ke sirsan hrûla hin ṭhung rawh,” in ti chun,"
"do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?",in lungrilin thlier bîk neia ngai- tuona suol puta sawisêltu chu in ni naw ding am a nih?
"Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?","Ka unau dittakhai, ngai ta u, Pathienin hi khawvêl thila pasiehai hi, ringnaa hausa ding le, ama hmangaituhai kuoma a tiem ram chu hluotu dingahai a ruot naw am a nih?"
"But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?","Nangni ruok chun pasie chu in sukmuolpho ta lem a nih. Mi hau- sahai chu a suknawmnatu cheu le, rorêlna ina kei lût hlaktu cheu chu an ni naw am a nih?"
Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?,Hming inzaumtak in put hi hrilsetuhai an ni naw am a nih?
"Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Lekha thu, “Nang în hmangai angin i vêng- hai i hmangai ding a nih,” ti lal dân hi in zâwm chun, in thaw ṭha;"
"but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.","amiruokchu, mi thlier bîk in nei chun, in suksuol a nih, Dânin bâw- setuah ân changtir si cheu a."
"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.","Tûkhawmin Dân zâwm kim sienla khawm, kawng khatah a suk- suol si chun, a rênga chun thiemnaw changin a um tah a nih."
"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.","“Uire naw,” titu chun, “Tuol that naw,” a ti bawk sih a. Chuongchun, uire naw la khawm tuol i that si chun, Dân bawsetu i ni hrim hrim ta a nih."
"So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.","Chuleiin, zalênna dâna mi ro rêl pêka um dinghai angin thu hril unla, thil thaw bawk ro."
For judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.,"Mi chunga lunginsietna nei naw chu, lunginsietna ṭhang loa rorêl pêkin um a tih, lunginsietna chu rorêlna chunga chun ân suong hlak a nih."
"What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?","Ka unauhai, miin, “Ringna ka nei,” ti sienla, thilthaw a ṭhang si naw chun ieng am ṭhahnem a ta? chuong ang ringna chun ama a sandam thei ding am a nih?"
"If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,","Unaupa amanih, unaunu ama- nih, saruoka umin, an ni tin bu tlasam sienla;"
"and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?","chun, nangni laia tûin amanih an kuomah, “Thlamuongtakin fe unla, lumtak le khawptakin um ro,” ti unla, taksa ta dinga thil ṭûl chu in pêk si naw chun ieng am ṭhahnem a ta?"
"Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.","Chuong ang bawkin ringna chu, thilthaw nei loa ama chaua a um chun thi a nih."
"Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from thy works, and I by my works will show thee my faith.","Anih, mi tûin amanih, “Nangin ringna i nei a, keiin thilthaw ka nei a nih; i ringna chu thilthaw ṭhang loin mîn entir rawh, chun, keiin ka thilthawin ka ringna inentir ka ti che."
"Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.","Pathien chu pakhat a ni ti i ring a ni maw? I ti ṭha, khawhrihai khawmin an ring a, an inthin hlak a nih,” tîng a tih."
"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?","Aw, mi teplopa, thilthaw ṭhang loa ringna ngawt chu iengkhawm a ni nawh ti i hriet nuom am?"
"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?",Ei thlatu Abraham chun a naupa Isak mâichâm chunga ân hlân lai khan thilthaw leiin thiem a chang a ni naw am a nih?
"Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;","Ringna chun a thilthaw leh a thaw hmunkhat a, chun, thilthaw leiin a ringna chu a famkim tah ti i hriet."
"and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.","Pathien Lekha Thu, “Abraham chun Pathien a ring a, chu ringna chu a felnaa ruot a nih,” ti thu kha a hung hlawtling a, chuongchun, Pathien Ruola inbûkin a um tah a."
"Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.","Ringna lei ngawt ni loin, thilthaw lei lemin, miin thiem a chang hlak ti in hriet tah."
"And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?","Chuong ang bawkin, Rahab nawchizawr khawm khan tirkohai kha a lo lâwm a, lampui danga ân fetir lai khan, thilthaw leiin thiem a chang a ni naw am a nih?"
"For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.","Thlarau ṭhang naw chun taksa chu thi a nih, chuong ang bawkin thilthaw ṭhang naw chun ringna khawm chu a thi a nih."
"Be not many of you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.","Ka unauhai, nangni laia mi tamtak hi inchûktirtuahai hung um naw ro, inchûktirtu chun rorêlna nasa lem kan tuok ding a nih ti kan hriet sih a."
"For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.","Thil tamtaka chun ei rêngin ei suol hlak sih a. Tûkhawm thuhril kawnga a suol naw chun, ama chu puitling a nih, a taksa pum khawm vêng thei mi a nih."
"Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.","Ngai ta u, ei thu an awi theina dinga sakawr bauahai thîrbar ei inba chun an taksa pum khawm ei kei her hlak."
"Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.","Ngai ta u, lawnghai khawm hi a lien hleh a, thli natak imût lêngin a um hlak a, nisienlakhawm, a suk- hertu chun ân fetir nuomna tieng phawtah sukherna chîterekin a sukher hlak."
"So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!","Chuong ang bawkin, lei khawm hi taksa pêng chîterek a na, nasa- takin a uong hlak. Ngai ta u! mei chîterekin ram a va kâng nasa de!"
"And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.","Chun, lei hi mei a nih; ei taksa pênghai laia rîtlona hlawm chu lei hi a nih; chu chun taksa chu a pumin a sukthieng naw a, piengpui tawlailîr chu a sukkâng a, ama chu hremhmun sukkâng a nih."
"For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:","Sa chi tinrêng dâm, vate chi tinrêng dâm, thilhring chi tinrêng dâm, tuisuorieta thil tinrêng dâm hi vai ngam thei a ni sih a, mihriemhai ivai ngamin an um bawk a;"
"but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison.","amiruokchu, lei hi tûkhawmin an vai ngam thei naw a nih; thina tûra sip, suol um ṭawk ṭawk thei naw a nih."
"Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:","Chu chun Lalpa le Pa ei inpâk hlak a, chu bawk chun Pathien anga siem mihriemhai chu ṭawngsie ei inphur bawk hlak a nih."
"out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.","Bau hmunkhata inthawkin in- pâkna le ṭawngse inphurna a suok hlak. Ka unauhai, chuong thil chu chuong ang chu a ni ding a ni nawh."
Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?,Tuikhur hin hnâr hmunkhatah tui inhnik le tui inhnik naw a suksuok hlak am a nih?
"can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet.","Ka unauhai, theichang kûngah oliv thei a ra thei am a nih? annawleh, grêp hruiah theichang a ra thei am a nih? Chuong ang bawkin chi khur hin tui al naw a suksuok thei bawk nawh."
Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.,"Nangni lai tû am vara, thu hre thei a um a? Thuhnuoirawltak le vartakin a thilthawhai a um dân ṭhain inentir raw se."
"But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.","Nisienlakhawm, in lungrilah îtthîkna khatak le mâni hmasielna in nei chun, thudik chu uong khum le kalin khêl hril naw ro."
"This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.","Chu varna chu chung tienga inthawka hung thla chu a ni nawh a, khawvêl le taksa châkna le khawhria inthawk a ni lem."
"For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.",îtthîkna le mâni hmasielna umnaa chun buoina le thilsuksuolna tinrêng a um hlak.
"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.","Chung tienga inthawka varna hung thla ruok chu a tîrin ân thieng phawt a; chu hnunga chun inrem a nuom a, a nun ân nêm a, a biek ân hawi a, lunginsietna le ra ṭhain a sip a, thlier bîk a nei nawh a, a vervêk naw a nih."
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.,Felna ra chu inremna siem- tuhai ta ding chun inremnain tu a nih.
"Whence come wars and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?","Nangni laia indona le insêlna hai hi khâwlaia inthawka hung suok am an na? In taksa pêngahai indona siem hlaktu, in nuom zâwnga in- thawkhai chun hung suok an ni naw am a nih?"
"Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.","In châk a, in nei si nawh a, tuol in that a, in inhnar a, in nei thei si nawh a; in insêl a, in indo a; in hni naw leiin in nei nawh a;"
"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.","in hnih a, in hni indik naw leiin in hmu nawh, in inhawitirna dingin hmang in tum sih a."
"Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.","Nangni uirenuhai, khawvêl ruol nina hi Pathien hmêlma nina a ni ti in hriet naw am a nih? Chuongchun, tûkhawm khawvêl ruol ni nuom taphawt chu Pathien hmêlmaah ân siem hlak a nih."
Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?,"Annawleh, “Thlarau einia ân chêngtir chun, thîk khawp hielin a mi dit a nih,” ti hi, Pathien Lekha Thuin iengkhawm ni loin a hrilin in ring am a nih?"
"But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.","Nisienlakhawm, lunginsietna tam nâwkzuol a pêk hlak; chuleiin, Pathien Lekha Thuin, “Pathienin mi chapohai a kal a, inngaitlâwmhai ruok chu lunginsietna a pêk hlak,” a ti a nih."
"Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.","Chuongchun, Pathien thu thuin um ro; amiruokchu, Diebol chu kal ro, chuongchun, tlân hmang san a ti cheu."
"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.","Pathien hnai ro, chuongchun, amain hnai a ti cheu. Mi suolhai, in kuthai sâwpfai ro, lungril bulbâl nei nawhai, in lungrilhai sukthieng ro."
"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.","Rimsi unla, lungngai unla, ṭap ro; in innui chu lungngaiah inchang sienla, in hlim nguiah inchang raw se."
"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.","Lalpa mithmuin inngaitlâwm ro, chuongchun, chawimawi a ti cheu."
"Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.","Unauhai, inhrilse tuo naw ro. Tûkhawmin a unau a hrilsietin amanih, a unau a sawisêlin amanih, Dân a hrilsietin Dân a sawisêl a nih; nisienlakhawm, Dân i sawisêl chun Dân zâwmtu i ni nawh a, rorêltu i ni lem."
"One only is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?","Dân petu le rorêltu pakhat chau a um; sandam theia, sukbohmang thei chu; nang tuolbâwmhai sawisêl- tu chu tu am i ni leh?"
"Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:","Tuhin ngai ta u khai! nangni, “Vawisûn amanih, zinga manih, chu khawpuia chun fêng ei ta, chutaka chun kum khat va thang ei ta, sumdâwng ei ta, hlâwkna hmûng ei tih,” tituhai,"
"whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.","zînga chun ieng am a hung um ding in hriet si nawh. In hringna chu ieng am a na? Sûm sâwt nawtê hung inlanga, bo nâwk el hlak ang hi in ni sih a."
"For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.","Chuongchun, “Lalpain rem a ti chun dam ei ta, chu chu, kha kha thâwng ei tih,” in ti ding hi a nih."
But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.,"Nisienlakhawm, in uongnahai hi in suong lem sih a; chuong ang suongna po po chu suol a nih."
"To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.","Chuongchun, tûkhawm thil ṭha thaw ding hre sia, thaw naw chu, a ta dingin suol a nih."
"Come now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.","Mi hausahai, ngai ta u khai! In chunga rinum hung tlung ding zing lei chun ṭap unla, khêk rak rak ro."
"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.","In rohai a se tah a, in puonhai hângthimin a fâk zo tah."
"Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.","In rângkachak le in tangkahai a tuiêk zo tah a; a tuiêk chu in thiem nawzie inhriettirna nîng a ta, in taksa chu mei kâng angin fâng a tih. Ni nuhnunga chun ro in inkhâwl a ni hi."
"Behold, the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.","Ngai ta u, in loa bu sîka inhlawfahai hlaw, hlêma in pêk naw kha, a khêk a, a sîktuhai lunginzing khêk ri khawm chu Mipuihai Lalpa naah a hung lût tah a."
"Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.","Khawvêla hin inhawitirtakin in um a, in insukthâm mei mei a; in that niin in lungril in suktlai a."
"Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous one; he doth not resist you.","Mi fel chu thiemnaw in inchang- tir a, in that tah a; ama chun a kal naw cheu."
"Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain.","Chuongchun, unauhai, Lalpa hung nâwk hmakhat chu seltakin lo um ro. Ngai ta u, lo neitu chun ruo tui tla hmasa le nuhnung chu a hmu hmakhat chu seltakin hnuoi ra hlutak chu a nghâk hlak."
Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.,Nangni khawm seltakin um ro; in lungril sukdet ro; Lalpa hungna chu a hnai ta sih a.
"Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors.","Unauhai, thiemnaw changa in um nâwna dingin inchier khum naw ro; ngai ta u, rorêltu chu kawtkhâr bulah a ngîr zing a nih."
"Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord.","Unauhai, Lalpa hminga thu hriltu le zâwlneihai chu, tuor dân le sel dân kawnga chun, enkhi dingin hmang ro."
"Behold, we call them blessed that endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.","Ngai ta u! tuortuhai chu hamṭha ei tih a, Job selzie chu in hriet a, Lalpain a tâwpa a thaw zie khawm kha in hmu bawk a; Lalpa chu lunginsietnain a sipzie le za a ngai theizie khawm kha."
"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.","Nisienlakhawm, ka unauhai, iengkhawm thaw unla, inkhâm naw ro, vân sâlin amanih, hnuoi sâlin amanih, thil dang hrim hrim amanih sâlin inkhâm naw ro: “A nih,” in ti chu, “A nih,” ni sienla, “A ni nawh,” in ti chu, “A ni naw,” ni raw se; chuong naw chun thiemnaw changin um in tih."
Is any among you suffering? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing praise.,Nangni lai thil ṭha naw tuor an um am? Ṭawngṭai raw se. Hlim an um am? Inpâkna hla sak raw se.
"Is any among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:","Nangni lai damnaw an um am? Kohran upa inkotir sienla, anni chun Lalpa hminga hriek nâlin a chungah ṭawngṭai raw hai se."
"and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.","Chun, ringnaa ṭawngṭaina chun damnaw chu sukdam a ta, Lalpa chun ama chu keitho a tih; chun, thil a lo suksuol ta chun, ngaidampêk nîng a tih."
"Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.","Chuongchun, sukdama in um theina dingin in suolhai thupha inchawi tuo unla, in ṭawngṭaipêk tuo hlak ro."
"Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months.","Mi fel ṭawngṭaina chun thil nasatak a thaw hlak. Elija chu eini mizie ang nei mihriem bawk a nih a, ama chun ruo sûr nâwna dingin ṭhahnemngaitakin a ṭawngṭai a; chun, kum thum le thla ruk sûng po chu, hnuoi chungah ruo a sûr ta nawh a."
"And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.","Chun, a ṭawngṭai nâwk a, vânin ruo ân sûrtir a, hnuoiin a rahai a hung insuoktir tah a."
"My brethren, if any among you err from the truth, and one convert him;","Ka unauhai, nangni laia mi tûkhawm thutaka inthawk chun inhmang sienla, chun, tuin amanih innghat kîrtir sienla,"
"let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.","mi suol a lampui inhmangnaa innghat kîrtirtu chun thinaa in- thawkin a thlarau sandam a ta, suol tamtak inkhumpêk bawk a tih ti inhre raw se."
