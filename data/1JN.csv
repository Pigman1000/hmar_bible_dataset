"That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life","Hringna Thu a tîra inthawka um kha, kan nâin kan ihriet kha, kan mitin kan ihmu kha, kan en zinga kan kuta kan idap kha, chu chu chanchin chu;"
"(and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us);","(chu hringna chu a hung inlang tah a, kan lo hmuh a, kan inhriettir bawk a, chu chatuon hringna, Pa kuoma um, kan kuoma hung inlang chu, kan hril cheu a ni hi);"
"that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:","chu kan ihriet le kan ihmu chu in kuomah kan hril ve cheu a ni hi, nangni khawma in mi pâwl ve theina dingin; anih, keini pâwlna chu Pa le a Naupa Isu Krista pâwlna a nih."
"and these things we write, that our joy may be made full.","Chuongchun, kan lâwm a fam- kim theina dingin hieng thuhai hi in kuomah kan ziek a ni hi."
"And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.","Chun, thuincha a kuoma in- thawka kan hriet a, in kuoma kan hril sâwng ding cheu chu hi hi a nih:— Pathien chu var a nih, amaa chun inthim hrim a um nawh."
"If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:","Inthima um siin, “Ama ka pâwl,” ei ti chun khêl ei hril a nih, thutak khawm chu ei zâwm nawh."
"but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.","Amiruokchu, ama chu vara a um angin eini khawm vara um ei ni chun, ei inpâwl tlâng a nih, chun, a Naupa Isu thisenin ei suol po po a mi sâwpfai pêk hlak a nih."
"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.","“Suol ka nei nawh,” ei ti chun mâni le mâni ei inhlêm fâwm a, thutak khawm chu einiah a um naw a nih."
"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.","Ei suolhai thupha ei chawi chun, ei suolhai ngaidam ding le, ei felnaw- na po po sâwpfai dingin ama chu ring a umin a fel a nih."
"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.","“Thil ka suksuol nawh,” ei ti chun ama chu khêlhlipah ei siem a, a thu khawm einiah a um naw a nih."
"My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:","Ka nauhai, thil in suksuol nâwna dingin hieng thu hi in kuomah ka ziek a ni hi. Tûkhawmin thil a suk- suol chun, Pa kuoma mi hrilpuitu Isu Krista mi fel chu ei nei."
"and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.","Ama chu ei suolhai thupha- chawina a nih; eini suol chau ni loin, khawvêl po po suol thuphachawina khawm a nih."
"And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.","Chun, a thupêkhai pawm ei ni chun, chutaka chun ama chu ei hriet ti ei inhriet."
"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;","A thupêkhai pawm si loin, “Ama ka hriet,” titu chu mi khêlhlip a nih, thutak amaah a um nawh."
"but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:",Tûkhawm a thu pawm taphawt chu amaa chun Pathien a hmangaina a famkim takzet tah a nih. Amaah ei um ti hitaka hin ei inhriet a nih.
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.,"“Amaah ka um zing hlak,” titu chu, ama a um ang bawk khan a um ve ding a nih."
"Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.","Dittakhai, thupêk thar chu in kuomah ka ziek nawh a; thupêk hlui a tira inthawka in nei kha, ka ziek lem a nih. Chu thupêk hlui chu in thu hriet ta hnung kha a nih."
"Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.","Nisienlakhawm, thupêk thar ziek ni bawk naw ning am, (chu chu amaah le nangniah ân lang a nih), inthim chu a bo zing lei le, var taktak chu tuhin a hung var ta leiin."
"He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.","Mâni unau theida sih a, “Varah ka um,” titu chu, tu chen khawm hin inthimah a la um zing a nih."
"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.","Mâni unau hmangaitu chu vara chun a um zing a, amaa chun tlûkna hrim a um nawh."
"But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.","Mâni unau theidatu ruok chu inthimah a um a, inthimah ân vâk bawk a nih; inthimin a mit a sukdel ta leiin a fena khawm a hriet ngai nawh."
"I write unto you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.","Nauhai, ama hming leiin in suolhai ngaidam a ni tâk leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni hi."
"I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father.","Pahai, ama, a tira inthawka um zing chu in hriet leiin in kuomah ka ziek a nih. Ruoltharhai, mi suol chu in hne tâk leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni hi."
"I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.","Nauhai, Pa chu in hriet leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni kha. Pahai, ama a tîra inthawka um zing chu in hriet leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni kha. Ruoltharhai, in hrât a, Pathien thu nangniah a um zing a, mi suol chu in hne tâk leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni kha."
"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.","Khawvêl hi hmangai naw unla, khawvêla thil umhai khawm hi hmangai bawk naw ro. Mi tûkhawm- in khawvêl a hmangai chun, Pa a hmangaina amaah a um nawh."
"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.","Khawvêla thil um po po, tisa châkna dâm, mit châkna dâm, dam sûng ropuina tehlêm dâm hi Paa inthawka suok a ni nawh a, khawvêla suok a ni lem sih a."
"And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.","Khawvêl hi a châkna pumin a bohmang zing a nih, Pathien dit- zawng thawtu ruok chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih."
"Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour.","Nauhai, hun nuhnung tak chu a ni tah, Krista kaltu hung a tih ti in hriet ang khan, tu khawm hin Krista kaltu tamtak an hung suok tah; chuleichun, hun nuhnung tak a ni tah ti ei hriet."
"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us.","Anni chu eini laia inthawkin an suok a, nisienlakhawm, eini mi tak an ni nawh; eini mi tak ni hai sienla, eini kuomah an um ve pei ding a ni sih a. Nisienlakhawm, an rêngin eini mi tak an ni naw vawng ti ân lang fel theina dingin an mi suoksan ta a nih."
"And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things.","Mi Inthieng kuoma inthawkin hriek nâlna in chang a, iengkim in hriet a nih."
"I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.","Thutak thu in hriet naw leiin ka ziek a ni nawh a, in hriet lei le, thutakah khêl iengkhawm a suok ngai naw leiin ka ziek lem a nih."
"Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he that denieth the Father and the Son.",Isu chu Krista a nih ti awinawtu nêka khêlinhlip tu am um an ta? Tûkhawm Pa le Naupa awinaw chu Krista kaltu a nih.
"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.",Tûkhawm Naupa awinaw chun Pa khawm a pawm chuong nawh; Naupa awitu ruok chun Pa khawm a pawm a nih.
"As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.","Nangni chun chu, a tira in- thawka in hriet kha, nangniah inum- tir zing ro. Chu a tîra inthawka in hriet chu nangniah a um zing chun, nangni khawm Naupaa le Paa chun um zing in tih."
"And this is the promise which he promised us, even the life eternal.","Chun, hi hi a nih, ama ngeiin thil a mi tiem kha — Chatuona hring- na hi."
These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray.,"Chuong nangni ṭhuoi hmang tumtuhai thu chu, in kuomah ka ziek a nih."
"And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him.","Nangni chu ama kuoma in- thawka hriek nâlna in hmu kha nangniah a umzing a, tu inchûktir khawm in ngai nawh, ama hriek nâlna chun thil po po thu ân chûktir lem cheu lei le, indiktak a na, khêl khawm a ni naw leiin, chu chu ân chûktir ang cheu khan amaah um zing ro."
"And now, my little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.","Chuongchun, nauhai, amaah um zing ro; chuongchun, ama chu hung inlâr sien khawm, a hungin a hmaah inzak loin huoitakin um thei ei tih."
"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him.","Ama chu mi fel a nih ti in hriet chun, mi tûkhawm felna thaw chu ama inei a ni ti in hriet."
"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.","Ngai ta u, Pain a mi hmangaina chu a va nasa de! “Pathien nauahai,” a mîn bûk ta chu; chuong ang chu ei ni hrim a nih. Hi hi lei hin khawvêlin a mi hriet naw a nih, ama chu an hriet naw leiin."
"Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.","Dittakhai, tuhin Pathien nauhai ei na, iengtin am ei um ding ti chu a lân lang hri nawh a; ama a hung inlang pha chun ama angin ei um ding a nih ti chu ei hriet, ama chu a um pângngai angtakin ei hmu ding a ni sih a."
"And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.",Tûkhawm ama chunga chu bei- seina nei taphawt chu ama ân thieng angin ân sukthieng hlak.
Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.,Tûkhawm thil suksuol taphawt chun dân khawm a bawsiet a nih; suol hi dân bawsietna a ni sih a.
And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.,Ama chu suolhai la hmang dingin a hung inlang tah ti in hriet; amaa chun suol iengkhawm a um si nawh a.
"Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.","Tûkhawm amaa um zing chun thil a suksuol nawh; tûkhawm thil suksuol chun ama chu a hmu nawh a, hriet khawm a hriet bawk nawh."
"My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:","Nauhai, tû ihlêm khawmin um naw ro; felna thawtu chu a fel a nih, ama a fel ang bawkin."
"he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.","Thil suksuoltu chu Diebola suok a nih; Diebol chun a tîra inthawkin thil a suksuol sih a, Pathien Naupa hung inlang san tak chu Diebol sin- thawhai a sukbohmang theina dingin a nih."
"Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.","Tûkhawm Pathien inei chun, Pathien chi amaa a um zing leiin thil a suksuol ngai nawh; Pathien inei a ni leiin thil a suksuol thei bawk nawh."
"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.","Hitaka hin Pathien nauhai le Diebol nauhai ân hriet a nih; tû- khawm felna thaw naw chu Pathiena inthawka suok a ni nawh a, a unau hmangai naw khawm chu Pathiena inthawka suok a ni bawk nawh."
"For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:","Hi hi a tira inthawka thuincha in ihriet kha a ni sih a, ei inhma- ngaituo seng ding a nih, ti hi;"
"not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.","Kaina mi suol laia mi, mani unau thattu ang khan um loin. Ieng- leiin am a that a? Ama thilthawhai a suol a, a unau thilthawhai a fel leiin."
"Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.","Unauhai, khawvêlin an theida cheu chun mak ti naw ro."
"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.","Unauhai ei hmangai leiin thi- naa inthawkin ei suok a, hringnaah ei lût tah ti ei hriet. Tûkhawm hma- ngaina nei naw taphawt chu thinaah a la um zing a nih."
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.,Tûkhawm a unau theida chu tuolthat a nih; tuolthattu tûkhawm chatuona hringna nei zing hrim an um nawh ti in hriet sih a.
"Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.","Hitaka hin hmangaina chu ieng am a ni ei hriet, ama chun ei ta dingin a hringna a pêk ta leiin, eini khawmin unauhai ta dingin ei hring- na ei pêk ve ding a nih."
"But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawm, khawvêl sum neiin, a unau tlasamin hmu sienla, ama chu lainat si naw sienla, Pathien hmangaina chu ama- ah iengtin am um a ti leh?"
"My little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.","Nauhai, thu chauin inhmangai nâwm ei niu, lei chauin inhmangai naw bawk ei tiu; thilthaw le titak- zetin ni lem raw se."
"Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:","Chutaka chun thutaka inthawk ei nih ti inhrieng ei ta, ama mithmu ngeiah ei lungril chu thlêm tlai bawk ei tih,"
"because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.","ei lungrilin thiemnaw a mîn changtirna kawnga chun, Pathien chu ei lungril nêkin a ropui lem a, iengkim a hriet sih a."
"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;","Dittakhai, ei lungrilin thiem- naw a mîn changtir naw chun, Pathien tieng ei huoi a nih,"
"and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.","chuongchun, a thupêkhai ei zâwm a, a mithmuah thil lâwmum ei thaw hlak leiin, ei hni taphawt a kuoma inthawkin ei hmu pei hlak a nih."
"And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.","A thupêk chu hi a nih, a Naupa Isu Krista hming awi inla, amain thu a mi pêk angin inhmangai tuo bawk inla."
"And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.","A thupêkhai zâwm chu amaah a um zing a, ama khawm chu amaah a um zing bawk a nih. Chun, hitaka hin ama chu einiah a um zing ti ei hriet. Thlarau a mi pêka hin."
"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.","Dittakhai, thlarau nazawng chu ring naw ro, amiruokchu, thlarauhai chu Pathiena inthawk an ni le ni naw infie ro; thuhriltu tehlêm tamtak khawvêlah an hung suok ta leiin."
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:,Hi hin Pathien Thlarau chu hrieng in tih; thlarau iengkhawm Isu Krista tisaah a hung inchang ti ṭan chu Pathiena inthawk a nih; thlarau iengkhawm Isu ṭan naw chu Pathiena inthawk a ni nawh.
"and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.","Chu chu Krista kaltu thlarau, a hung ding in hriet kha a nih; tu khawm hin khawvêlah a um zing tah a nih."
"Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.","Nauhai, Pathiena inthawk in na, chuong chu in hne tah, nangnia um chu khawvêla um nêk chun a ropui lem leiin."
"They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them.","Anni chu khawvêla mi an na, chuleiin khawvêla mi angin an ṭawng a, khawvêlin an thu an ngai hlak a nih."
"We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.","Eini Pathiena inthawk ei na; Pathien hretu chun ei thu a ngai hlak a, Pathiena inthawka mi ni lo chun ei thu a ngai ngai nawh. Chuonga chun thlarau indiktak le indiknaw ei hriet a nih."
"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.","Dittakhai, inhmangai tuo seng ei tiu; hmangaina hi Pathiena inthawka suok a ni sih a; mi tin, hmangaina nei taphawt chu Pathien inei an ni tah a, Pathien an hriet bawk a."
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.,Hmangaina nei naw chun Pathien a hriet nawh; Pathien chu hmangaina a ni sih a.
"Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.","Hitaka hin Pathien hmangaina ei chungah a hung inlang tah, ama leia ei hring theina dinga Pathienin a Naupa nei sun khawvêla a hung tira hin."
"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.","Hitaka hin hmangaina a um, einin Pathien ei hmangai ka ti a ni nawh a, amain a mi hmangai a, ei suolhai thuphachawina ni dingin a Naupa a hung tir ka ti lem a nih."
"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.","Dittakhai, Pathienin chuong ang lâwma a mi hmangai chun, eini khawm ei inhmangai tuo seng ding a nih."
"No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:","Tûkhawmin ienglai khawmin Pathien an hmu ngai nawh. Ei inhmangai tuo chun Pathien einiah um zing a ta, a hmangaina khawm einiah famkim bawk a tih."
"hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.","Amaah ei um zing le ama chu einiah a um zing ti hitaka hin ei hriet, a thlarau a mi pêk ta lei hin."
And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.,"Chun, Pain Naupa chu khawvêl sandamtua um dingin a hungtir ti ei hmu tah a, ei inhriettir a nih."
"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.","Tûkhawm, “Isu hi Pathien Nau- pa a nih,” tia ṭan taphawt chu, amaa chun Pathien a um zing a, ama khawm chu Pathienah a um zing bawk a nih."
"And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.","Pathienin einia hmangaina a inei chu ei hriet a, ei awi bawk a nih. Pathien chu hmangaina a nih, hmangainaa um zing chu Pathienah a um zing a, Pathien khawm amaah a um zing a nih."
"Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.",Hitaka hin ei chungah hma- ngaina a famkim tah; rorêl nia ṭi loa ei um theia hin; ama um anga khawvêla hin ei um leiin.
"There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.","Hmangainaa chun ṭitna hrim a um nawh; hmangaina famkimin ṭitna a hnawt suok lem hlak a nih, ṭitnaa chun hremna a um sih a; a ṭitu chu hmangainaah a la famkim naw a nih."
"We love, because he first loved us.",Amain a mi hmangai hmasak leiin ei hmangai a nih:
"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.","Miin, “Pathien ka hmangai,” tiin a unau theida si sienla, ama chu khêlinhlip a nih; a unau a ihmu zing ta hman a hmangai naw chun, Pathien a ihmu ngai naw chu iengtin am hmangai thei a ta?"
"And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.","Ama kuoma inthawkin hi thupêk hi ei nei “Tukhawmin Pathien a hmangai chun a unau khawm a hmangai bawk ding a nih,” ti hi."
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.,Tûkhawm Isu hi Krista a ni ti ring chu Pathien inei a nih; tûkhawm a neitu hmangai chun a inei khawm a hmangai hlak.
"Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.","Hitaka hin Pathien nauhai ei hmangai ti ei hriet, Pathien ei hmangai a, a thupêkhai ei zâwm hin."
"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.","Pathien ei hmangaina chu hi hi a nih, a thupêkhai ei zâwm hi. A thupêkhai chu a khir si nawh a."
"For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith.","Pathien inei taphawt chun khaw- vêl a hne pei sih a; hi hi khawvêl hnea ngamna chu a nih, ei ringna hi."
"And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?",Isu hi Pathien Naupa a nih ti ringtu chau naw chun tuin am khawvêl a hne hlak a?
"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.","Hi hi a nih tui le thisena hung chu, Isu Krista hi; tui chauah ni loin, tuia le thisenah a ni lem. Inhriettirtu chu Thlarau hi a nih. Thlarau chu thutak a ni leiin."
"And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.","Inhriettirtu chu pathum an um,"
"For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.",Thlarau le tui le thisen chu: chuong pathum chu an inthuruol a nih.
"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.","Mihriem inhriettirna hman ei pawm chun Pathien inhriettirna chu a ropui lem sih a; Pathien inhriet- tirna chu hi hi a nih, “Ka Naupa chanchin kân hriettir tah,” ti hi."
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son.,"Pathien Naupa ringtu chun mâniah hrietna a nei a nih; Pathien ringnawtu chun ama chu khêlhlipah a siem a nih, Pathienin a Naupa chanchin ân hriettir chu a ring naw leiin."
"And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.","Inhriettirna chu hi hi a nih, Pathienin chatuona hringna a mi pêk a, chu hringna chu a Naupaah a um a nih."
He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life.,"Naupa neitu chun hringna chu a nei a, Pathien Naupa neinawtu chun hringna chu a nei nawh."
"These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, even unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God.","Chatuona hringna in nei ti in hriet theina dingin, nangni Pathien Naupa hming ringtuhai kuomah hieng thu hi ka ziek a nih."
"And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us:","Hi hi ama chunga ei huoina chu a nih, iengkhawm a ditzâwng anga ei hni chun amain a mi ngai pêk hlak hi."
"and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.","Chuongchun, iengkhawm ei hni taphawt a mi ngaipêk hlak ti ei hriet chun, a kuoma ei thil hni chu ei hmu tah ti ei hriet a nih."
"If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.","Tûkhawmin a unau thina khawp nilo suol thawin hmu sienla, hnipêk a ta, chuongchun, Pathienin a hnitu kuoma chun thina khawp nilo suol thawtuhai ta ding chun hringna pêng a tih.

"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.","Pathien Naupa chu a hung a. Mi Indiktak chu hre thei dingin hriettheina a mi pêk ti ei hriet bawk a; chun, eini, a Naupa Isu Kristaa ei um hin Mi Indiktaka chun ei um a nih. Ama chu Pathien indiktak a na, chatuona hringna khawm a nih."
"My little children, guard yourselves from idols.","Nauhai, milima inthawkin in siekieng ro."
