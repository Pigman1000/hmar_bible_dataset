"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.","Abraham naupa, David naupa, Isu Krista thlatuhai inthlazie chanchin chu:"

and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;,"Salmonin Rahab leh, Boaz a thlah a; Boazin Ruth leh, Obed a thlah a; Obedin Jessai a thlah a;"
and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah;,"Jessaiin lal David a thlah a; chun Davidin Uria nuhmei leh, Solomon a thlah a;"
and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;,Solomonin Rehoboam a thlah a; Rehoboamin Abia a thlah a; Abiain Asa a thlah a;
and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;,Asain Jehosaphat a thlah a; Jehosaphatin Jehoram a thlah a; Jehoramin Uzzia a thlah a;
and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;,Uzziain Jotham a thlah a; Jothamin Ahaz a thlah a; Ahazin Hezekia a thlah a;
and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;,Hezekiain Manasse a thlah a; Manassein Amos a thlah a; Amosin Josia a thlah a;
"and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.","Babulon tienga sala an ṭhuoi lai vel khan, Josiain Jekonia le a unau- hai a thlah a;"
"And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;","Chun, Babulon tienga sala an ṭhuoi hnungin Jekoniain Salathiel a thlah a; Salathielin Zerubbabel a thlah a;"
and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;,Zerubbabelin Abiud a thlah a; Abiudin Eliakim a thlah a; Eliakimin Azor a thlah a;
and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;,Azorin Sadok a thlah a; Sadokin Akim a thlah a; Akimin Eliud a thlah a;
and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;,Eliudin Eleazar a thlah a; Elea- zarin Matthan a thlah a; Matthanin Jakob a thlah a;
"and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.",Jakobin Josef Mari pasal chu a thlah a; chu Maria chun Isu Krista an ti hi a hung insieng tah a.
So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.,"Chuongchun, suon po po chu Abrahama inthawk David chenin suon sâwmpali, Davida inthawka Babulon tienga sala an ṭhuoi chenin suon sâwmpali, Babulon tienga sala an ṭhuoia inthawka Krista chenin suon sâwmpali an nih."
"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Isu Krista hung insieng- zie chu hieng ang hi a nih: A nu Mari chu Josef le an inhuol laiin, an inpâwl hmain Thlarau Inthiengin ân raitir ti an lo hriet tah a."
"And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.","Chun, a pasal Josef chu mi feltak a na; tlâng ihriet a nuom nawh a; arûka mâk el a nuom a."
"But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thu chu a ngaituo laiin, ngai ta, a mangah Lalpa vântirko a kuomah a hung inlâr a, “Josef, nang David naupa, Mari chu nuhmeia nei ṭi naw rawh; a nau vawn chu Thlarau Inthienga inthawk a nih i sawnnaw."
And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.,"Naupasal nei a ta, a hming chu Isu sak i tih; ama chun a mihai an thil suksuolnaa inthawkin a sandam ding a ni sih a”, a ta."
"Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,","Lalpain zâwlnei baua,"
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us.","“Ngai ta, nunghâk inthieng chu inrâi a ta, Naupasal nei a ta; A hming dingin Immanuel sak an tih,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin chuong po po chu a hung um a nih. (Immanuel chu, “Ei kuomah Pathien a um” tina a nih)."
"And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;","Chuongchun, Josef chu a in a tho a; Lalpa vântirkoin a kuoma thu a pêk ang chun a thawh a; Mari chu a nei tah a;"
and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.,"nisienlakhawm, naupasal a nei hmakhat chu a pâwl nawh a; chun, a hming chu ISU a sak tah a."
"And he called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.","Chun, a inchûktir sâwm le pahnihai chu a ko a, anni hnawt dawk theina dingin khawhri inthiengnawhai chunga thuneina a pêk a; damnawna tinrêng le natna tinrêng sukdam theina dingin thuneina a pêk bawk a."
"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;","Tirko sâwm le pahni hai hming chu hieng hi an nih: A hmasataka chun Simon (Peter an ti) le a unau Andri hai, Zebedai naupa Jakob le a unaupa Johan hai;"
"Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus;","Philip le Bartholomai hai; Thoma le siedâwltu Matthai hai; Alphai naupa Jakob le Thaddai hai,"
"Simon the Cananæan, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.",Kanaana mi Simon le a inman- tirtu Juda Iskariot hai hi an nih.
"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and charged them, saying, Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans:","Chuong sâwm le pahni hai chu Isûn a tir suok a, an kuomah thu a pêk a: “Jentailhai lampuiah fe naw unla, Samari mihai khuo hrim hrima khawm lût naw ro;"
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.,"amiruokchu, Israel hnam berâm inhmanghai kuoma chun fe lem ro."
"And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.","Chun, in fein, ‘vân ram chu a hung hnai tah,’ tiin hril pei ro."
"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give.","Damnawhai sukdam unla, mithi- hai keitho unla, phârhai sukthieng unla, khawhrihai hnawt dawk ro, a thlâwnin in hmuh a, a thlâwnin pe ro."
"Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;","In kâwngkhihaiah rângkachak tangka amanih, tangka manih, dâr tangka amanih chawi naw ro."
"no wallet for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.","Inzinna dingin mansa amanih, zakuo pahni amanih, kekawk amanih, hmawl amani khawm chawi naw ro; sinthawtu chu a fâk ding hmu tlâk a ni sih a."
"And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth.","“Chun, khaw liena manih, khaw chîna manih, in lûtna taphawta chun ân tlungtir tlâk ding cheu mi zawng dawk unla, in suok nâwk hmakhat chutaka chun tlung zing ro."
"And as ye enter into the house, salute it.","Chun, ina chun in lût dingin chibai bûk ro."
"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.","Chun, ina mihai chu intlungtir tlâk cheu an ni chun, in thlamuongna thu chu an chungah tlung sienla; an tlâk naw ruok chun in thlamuongna thu chu in chungah hung kîr nâwk raw se."
"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.","Chun, tukhawm lâwm lo cheu a, in thu khawm ngai naw taphawt chu, chu ina inthawka manih, chu khuoa inthawka manih in suok pha chun in kephaa pilvut chu thin thla ro;"
"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, ngaituo nia chun chu khuohai nêk chun Sodom le Gomorra ram tuor ding chu a dân um lem a tih."
"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.","“Ngai ta u, satenehai laia berâm um angin ka tir cheu hi; chuongchun, rûl anga vara, vaṭhu anga pawi tâwkloin um unla."
"But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you;","Nisienlakhawm, mihriem lai chun fimkhur ro, rorêltuhai an in- mantir ding cheu a ni sih a, in- khâwmna inahai vuong an ti cheu a;"
"yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.","anih, hotuhai le lalhai hmaah annihai le Jentailhai inhriettirna dingin, keima leiin la ṭhuoi an ti cheu."
"But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.","Nisienlakhawm, an inmantir pha cheu khawm, ‘Iengtin am, ieng thu am ka hril ding?’ tiin lungkham naw ro; in hril ding chu a hun taka chun ân hriettir ding cheu a ni sih a."
"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.","A hriltu chu nangni in ni âwm si nawh a, in Pa Thlarau nangnia thu hriltu khan a hril lem ding a nih."
"And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.","“Chun, sukhlum dingin unaupa le unaupa inmantir an ta, pa khawmin a nau inmantir bawk a tih; nauhai khawmin an nu le pahai do an ta, insukhlumtir bawk an tih."
"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.","Keia hming leiin mi po po theida nîng in tih; nisienlakhawm, a tâwp chena tuor pei chu, chu ngei chu sandamin um a tih."
"But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.","“Chuongchun, hi khuoa hin an suknawmna pha cheu, khaw dangah tlân san ro; titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Mihriem Naupa a hung hmain Israel khuohai chu fang suok naw ti niu."
"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.",“Inchûktir a inchûktirtu chung- ah a um nawh; suok khawm a pu chungah a um bawk nawh.
"It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household!","Inchûktir chu inchûktirtu anga a hung um le, suok chu a pu anga a hung um chu a hun deh. In neitupa hman Beelzebub an ti chun, a sûnghai chu an va ti nasa awm deh e!"
"Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.","“Chuongchun, anni chu ṭi naw unla; inlang lo dinga thup hmang iengkhawm a um si nawh a; hriet naw dinga ip iengkhawm a um bawk nawh."
"What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the house-tops.","Inthima ka hril cheu hi varah hril ro, na bula in hriet hi in chunga chuongin tlânginsampui ro."
"And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","“Chun, taksa sukhluma thlarau sukhlum thei nawhai chu ṭi naw unla, Hremhmuna thlarau le taksa sukbo thei ruok chu ṭi ro."
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:,"Chawngzawng pahni dâr tang- ka pakhatin an zawr hlak a ni naw am a nih? nisienlakhawm, anni laia pakhat khawm in Pa boin hnuoiah tla naw ni."
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.,In samzai chen khawm hi tiem vawng a nih in sawnnaw.
Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.,"Chuleichun, ṭi naw ro; chawngzawng tamtak nêkin in hlu lem a nih."
"Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.","“Chuongchun, mihai hmaa a mi ṭan taphawt chu, ka Pa vâna mi hmaah ṭan vêng ka tih."
"But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.","Nisienlakhawm, tukhawm mi- hai hmaa a mîn phat taphawt chu, ka Pa vâna mi hmaah inphat vêng ka tih."
"Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.","“Khawvêla hin inremna inlêng- tir dinga hung am ka nih mi sâwn naw ro; inremna inlêngtir dinga hung ka ni nawh a, kâwlhnâm inlêngtir dinga hung ka ni lem."
"For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law:","Mi a pa indotir dingin, naunu a nu indotir dingin, mo le a pi indotir dinga hung ka nih in sawnnaw."
and a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.,Mi a hmêlmahai chu ama sûnghai laia mi ngei nîng an tih.
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.,"“Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih keia nêka hmangai lem chu ka mi ni tlâk a ni nawh; tukhawm naupa amanih, naunu amanih keia nêka hmangai lem chu ka mi ni tlâk a ni nawh."
"And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.",Tukhawm a kraws puta mi zui naw chu ka mi ni tlâk a ni nawh.
He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.,Tukhawm a hringna hmu chun chân a ta; keia leia hringna chân chun hmûng a tih.
"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.","“Tukhawm a lâwm cheu chu a mi lâwm a na, tukhawm a mi lâwm chu, a mi tirtu lâwm a nih."
He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.,"Tukhawm zâwlnei chu zâwlnei a ni leia lâwm chun, zâwlnei lâwmman hmûng a tih; tukhawm mi fel chu mi fel a ni leia lâwm chun mi fel lâwmman hmûng a tih."
"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward.","Chun, tukhawm hieng mi chîn- tak laia pakhat kuoma hin, tirko a ni leia tuisik no khat chau khawm pe taphawt chun, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a lâwmman chu chân naw tawp a tih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.","Chun, Isûn a inchûktir sâwm le pahni hai chu thu a pêk zo phingleh chutaka inthawkin an khuohaia inchûktir le thu hril dingin a fe tah a."
"Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples","Chun, Johanin Krista thilthaw- hai chu intângna inah a lo hrietin a inchûktirhai ân palaitir a, a kuomah,"
"and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?","“A hung ding chu i ni, mi dang kan la ngai ding?” tiin."
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta unla, thil in hmu le in hriet hi Johan kuomah va hril ro;"
"the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.","mitdelhai an mit a lo var tah, kebaihai kein an lâwn tah, phârhai an lo inthieng tah, nasêthai an na a lo var tah, mithihai keithoin an um tah, pasiehaiin Chanchin Ṭha thu hril an dawng tah."
"And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.","Chun, tukhawm ka chunga lungninawna hmu naw chu, a hamṭha,” tiin a lo dawn a."
"And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?","Chun, chuhai chu an fe phingleh, Isûn mipui kuoma chun Johan thu a hril tah a, “Ieng en dingin am thlalêrah in fe suok kha? Luong thli imût hnîng maw?"
"But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft raiment are in kings’ houses.","Annawleh, ieng en ding takin am in fe suok kha? Puon innêm sil maw? Ngai ta u, puon innêm silhai chu lal inahai in sawnnaw an um."
"But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.","Annawleh, ieng lei takin am in fe suok kha? Zâwlnei en dingin maw? A ni ngei kha, ka ti cheu hi, zâwlnei nêk khawma ropui lem,"
"This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.","‘En ta, ka tirko i hmaah ka tir a nih. Ama chun i hmaah i lampui siem a tih,’ tia a chanchin an inziek kha ama hi a nih."
"Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, nuhmei sûnga insieng laiah Baptistu Johan nêka ropui lem an la suok ngai nawh, nisienlakhawm, vân rama mi chîn deu khawm ama nêkin an ropui lem sih a."
"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force.","Baptistu Johana inthawk tu chen hin vân ram chun thaw rakna a tuok hlak a, a thaw rakhai chun an pâwnglâk hlak."
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.,"Zâwlneihai po po le Dân thu chun, Johan hung um chen khan an hril lâwk hlak a nih."
"And if ye are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, that is to come.","In awi nuom chun, chu chu Elija, a hung ding chu a nih."
"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.",Tukhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se.
"But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows","“Nisienlakhawm, tulai ruol- tharhai hi ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka ta? Naupang dâwr hmunahai ṭhung a, an ruolhai ko a,"
"and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.","‘Theihle kan mût pêk cheu a, in lâm si nawh a, Kan ṭap rak a, âwm in chum si nawh a,’ tihai ang hi an nih."
"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.","“Johan chu a hung a, a fâkin a dâwn nawh a, ‘Khawhri a zâwl a ni hi,’ an ta."
"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.","Mihriem Naupa a hung a, a fâkin a dâwn a, ‘En ta u, bu he mi, uoin he mi, siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai ruolpa saw,’ an ti sih a. Nisien- lakhawm, Varna chu a thilthawhaiin an inthiem,” a ta."
"Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.","Chun, an sim naw leiin a thilmak thaw tamna tak khuohai chu a hal tah a."
"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","“Korazin, i chung a rik! Bethsaida, i chung a rik! Nangnia thilmak thawa umhai kha, Tura le Sidona thaw ni sienla, saiip puon sila vut laia ṭhungin um tâng an tih."
"But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ti cheu hi ngaituo nia chun nangni tuor nêkin Tura le Sidon tuor chu a dân um lem a tih."
"And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.","Chun, nang Kapernaum, vân chena chawimawi i ni ding am a nih? Mithi khuo chenin i zu fe ding i sawnnaw. Nangmaa thilmak thawa umhai kha Sodoma thaw ni sienla, tu chen hin la um zing a tih."
"But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ti che hi, ngaituo nia chun i tuor nêk chun Sodom ram tuor ding chu a dân um lem a tih,” a ta."
"At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:","Chu lai chun Isûn a biek a, “Aw Pa, hnuoi le vân Lalpa, nangin mi var le mi bengvârhai kuomah hieng thu hi i ip a, nautehai kuomah i phuong lei hin kân pâk che."
"yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.","Anih, Pa, chuong anga thaw chu i ngaiin a ṭha a nih."
"All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him.","Ka pain thil iengkim a mîn kawltir tah; Pa naw chun Naupa hi tukhawmin an hriet nawh. Chun, Naupa le Naupain a phuong nuom- nahai chau naw chun tukhawmin Pa chu an hriet bawk nawh."
"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.","“Nangni sininrim le phur rik phur po pohai, ka kuomah hung unla, keiin inchâwltir ka ti cheu."
"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.","Ka rîngkawl bât unla, ka kuomah inchûk ro; thuhnuoirawl le lungrila inngaitlâwmtak ka ni hi; chuongchun, in thlarau ta dingin châwlna hmûng in tih."
"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.","Ka rîngkawl chu ân hâwi a, ka phur khawm a zâng a nih,” a ta."
At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.,"Chu lai chun, Isu chu châwlniin bu bilah a fe thleng a; a inchûktirhai chu an phîng a ṭâm a, buvuihai chu an thliek a, an fâk tah a."
"But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.","Chun, Pharisaihaiin chu chu an hmu chun a kuomah, “En ta, i inchûktirhaiin Châwlnia thaw thieng naw chu an thaw hi,” an ta."
"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “A ruolhai le an phîng ṭâm laia David thilthaw kha in tiem ngai naw am a nih?"
"how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?","Khânga Pathien inah a lût a, ama le a ruolhai fâk thieng naw, thiempuhai chau ifâk thieng entirna bei an fâk thu kha?"
"Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?","Annawleh, Châwlniin Pathien biekina thiempu umhai chun Châwlni an bawr khawmin an thiem pei ti Dân thua chun in tiem naw am a nih?"
"But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.","Iengkhawm ni sien, Pathien biekin nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um ti ka hril cheu hi."
"But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.","Nisienlakhawm, ‘Inthâwina dit loin lunginsietna ka dit,’ ti hi a umzie hre thiem sa ni unla chu, mi thiemhai chu thiemnaw in inchangtir naw ding bah."
For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.,"Mihriem Naupa hi Châwlni Lal a ni sih a,” a ta."
"And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun a feh a, an inkhâwmna inah a va lût a."
"and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat kut zeng a lo um a, chun, an hêk theina dingin, “Châwlniin sukdam a thieng am?” tiin Isu an indawn a."
"And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni laia tukhawmin berâm pakhat nei unla, chu chu Châwlniin khurah tla ta ang sienla, tuin am chelin kei dawk nâwng in ta?"
How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.,"Berâm pakhat nêk chun mi- hriem pakhat chu a va hlu lem de! Chuleichun, Châwlnia sukṭhat a thieng,” a ta."
"Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.","Chu phingleh, chu mipa kuoma chun, “I kut phar rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, a phar a, a khing tieng angin a dam ta var a."
"But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihai chu an suok a, ama an sukhlum theina ding dân ngaituoin an inrâwn a."
"And Jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn chu chu a hrietin, chutaka inthawk chun a fe hmang tah a."
and charged them that they should not make him known:,"Chun, mi tamtakin ama an zui a, an rêngin a lo sukdam vawng a, a chanchin phuong lo dingin an kuomah a ti tlat a."
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,",Zâwlnei Isaiin hieng thu a hril hi a hung tlung theina dingin:
"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.","“En ta, ka siehlaw, ka ithlang, Ka idittak, ka lungrilin a ilâwm bêk bêk hi; A chungah ka Thlarau sieng ka ta, Chuongchun, Jentailhai kuomah rorêlna thu hril a tih."
"He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.","Sêl naw nih a, khêk bawk naw nih a; Kawtthlêrhaia khawm tukhawmin a râwl hre bawk naw ni hai."
"A bruised reed shall he not break, And smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory.","Hne dinga rorêlna a tir dawk hma khat chun Luong pawr suktan naw nih a, Pat khu khawm sukmit naw ni."
And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.,"Ama hming chu Jentailhai chun beisei phâng an tih,” ti hi."
"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.","Chu lai chun, mitdel ṭawng- theinaw khawhri iman pakhat a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; chun, ama chun a lo sukdam a, chuongchun, ṭawngtheinaw chu a hung ṭawng theiin, a hung hmu thei tah a."
"And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?","Chun, mipuihai po po chun mak an ti hle a, “Hi mipa hi David naupa chu a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
"But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharisaihaiin chu chu an hriet phingleh, “Hi mipa hin khawhri lal Beelzebub lei naw chun khawhrihai hnawt dawk naw ni,” an ta."
"And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:","Chun, Isûn an ngaituohai chu a lo hriet a, an kuomah, “Khâwlai ram khawm mâni indo taphawt chu an bo hlak; khâwlai khuo khawm sûngkhat khawm, mâni indo taphawt chu ngîr suok naw ni hai."
"and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?","Setanin Setan bawk a hnawt dawk chun, mâni indo nîng a tih in sawnnaw; a ram chu iengtin am ngîr suok a ta?"
"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.","Kei Beelzebub leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka lo ni chun, in nauhaiin tu leiin am an lo hnawt dawk hlak lie? Chuleiin, anni chu nangni ngaituotu dinghai nîng an tih."
"But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.","Amiruokchu, kei Pathien Thlarau leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka ni chun, Pathien ram in kuomah a hung tlung tah nîng a tih."
"Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.","Chuongchu a ni si naw chun, miin mi hrât chu a khuop hmasa bak naw chun, iengtin am mi hrât inah lûtin a sum lapêk thei a ta?

He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.,Tukhawm keia tienga ṭhang naw chu a mi do a nih; tukhawm a mi lâk khâwmpui naw chun a sukdar a nih.
"Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.","“Chuleiin, ka ti cheu hi, mi an suolna tinrênga le, Pathien an hril- sietna tinrênga chun ngaidam nîng an ta, Thlarau Inthieng meu hrilsetu ruok chu ngaidam ni naw ni hai."
"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.","Chun, tukhawm Mihriem Nau- pa sawisêl taphawt chu a sawisêlna chu ngaidam nîng a ta; tukhawm Thlarau Inthieng meu sawisêl taphawt chu a sawisêlna chu, hi dam sûnga khawm, hun la hung tlung dinga khawm chun, ngaidam ni naw nih."
"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.","“Thing chu a ṭha a, a ra khawm a ṭha, in ti naw nghâl an leh, thing chu a sie a, a ra khawm a sie, ti nghâl nghâl ro; thing chu a rain ân hriet sih a."
"Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.","Rûl thlahai, nangnîn suol zing pumin, iengtin am thu ṭha hril thei in ta? Lungrila sip liem chu bauin a hril hlak in sawnnaw."
The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.,"Mi ṭha chun a robâwm ṭhaa inthawkin thil ṭhahai a the dawk hlak, mi suol chun a robâwm siea inthawkin thil ṭha naw a the dawk hlak."
"And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.","Chun, ka hril cheu hi, mihaiin thu teplo an hril taphawt, chuong thu chanchin chu ngaituo nia chun hril an tih."
"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.","I thuhril chun thiem inchangtir a ti cheh a, i thuhril bawk chun thiemnaw inchangtir a ti che i sawn- naw,” a ta."
"Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.","Chu lai chun, Dân inchûktir- tuhai le Pharisaihai laia tuhaiin amanih an dawn a, a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i kuoma inthawkin inchikna hmu kan nuom,” an ta."
"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “Ruolthar suoltak le uire hmang takhai chun inchikna an zawng a; nisienlakhawm, zâwlnei Jona inchik- na chau naw chu an kuomah inchikna hrim hrim pêk ni naw ni;"
for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.,"Jona chu ni thum le zân thum ngapui phîng sûnga a um ang khan, Mihriem Naupa hi ni thum le zân thum hnuoi khur sûngah a um bawk ding a nih."
"The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.","Ninevi khuoa mihai chu ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai kuomah hin ngîr vêng an ta, thiemnaw inchangtir an tih; Jona thu hril leiin an sim sih a; Jona nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um in sawnnaw."
"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.","Simtieng lalnu kha ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai lai hin tho vêng a ta, thiemnaw inchangtir a tih; Solomon varna ngai ding hmanin kâwlkawdawnga inthawkin a hung sih a; ngai ta u, Solomon nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um in sawnnaw."
"But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.","“Chun, khawhri inthieng naw chu mi sûnga inthawka a suokin, châwlna zawngin tui um nawna hmunahai ân vâk ân vâk a, a hmu ngai si nawh a."
"Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.","Chun, ‘Ka suokna ina khan kîr nâwk el ka tih,’ a ta; chun, a va tlung chun, a ruoka, phît faia cheiṭhatin a hmuh a."
"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.","Chu phingleh a va feh a, ama nêka suol lem khawhri dang pasari a hung ṭhuoi a, chutaka chun an lût a, an um zing hlak a, chu mihriem um dân nuhnung lem chu a hmasa nêkin a hung ṭha naw lem hlak a nih.

"While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.","Mipuihai kuoma thu a la hril lai chun, ngai ta, a nu le a unauhai chu ama biek tumin tuolah an ngîr a."
"And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.","Chun, mi pakhatin a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i nu le i unauhai biek che tumin tuola sawn an ngîr zing ie,” an ta."
"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?","Ama ruok chun a hriltu kuoma chun, “Ka nu chu tu am a na? Ka unauhai khawm chu tuhai am an na?” tiin a dawn a."
"And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!","Chun, a inchûktirhai tieng a kut a phar a, “En ta u, ka nu le ka unauhai hi!"
"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.","Tukhawm ka Pa vâna mi dit zâwng thaw taphawt chu, ka unau le, ka farnu le, ka nuhai an nih in sawnnaw,” a ta."
"On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.","Chu ni chun Isu chu ina inthawkin a fe suok a, dîl panga chun a ṭhung a."
"And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.","Chun, a kuomah mipui nasatak an hung inkhâwm a, chuongchun, lawngah a chuong a, a ṭhung a; mipui po po ṭieuphoah an ngîr a."
"And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;","Chun, tekhithuin an kuomah thu tamtak a hril a, “Ngai ta u, bu chi thetu chu bu chi the dingin a feh a."
"and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:","Chun, a the laiin a ṭhen lampui sîrah a tlah a, vatehaiin an hung tlân zo tah a."
"and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:","Chun, aṭhen pielthlêng leihnuoi inphânna hmunah a tlah a, leihnuoi a sa naw leiin a mâwng nghâl tah a."
"and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.","Nisienlakhawm, nisa a hung insâng deuin em vuoiin a hung um a, zung a nei naw leiin a rawp el tah a."
And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:,"Chun, a ṭhen hlohlingnei lai a tlah a, hlo chu a hung mâwng sâng a, a dîp hmang tah a."
"and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.","A ṭhen hnuoi ṭhaah a tlah a, ṭhenkhat a lêt za dâm, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwmruk dâm, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwm- thum dâmin a hung ra tah a."
"He that hath ears, let him hear.","Tukhawm na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
"And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?","Chun, inchûktirhai chu an hung a, a kuomah, “Iengdinga an kuomah tekhithua i hril am?” an ta."
"And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Vân ram thurûk chu nangni ihriet chu phal a nih, anni ihriet ruok chu phal a ni nawh."
"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.","Tukhawm a nei taphawt chu pe sâng an ta, nei ṭeu an tih; nisienlakhawm, tukhawm a nei naw taphawt chu, an nei sun khawm lâkpêk an tih."
"Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.","Chuleichun, tekhithuin an kuomah ka hril a nih; hmu hai sien khawm an hmu ngai nawh a, nain hrehai sien khawm an hriet ngai nawh a, a ngaina khawm an hriet ngai naw leiin."
"And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:","Chun, Isai thuhrillâwk kha an chungah a hung tlung a ni hi; ‘Na chun hre dêng in ta chu, a ngaina ruok chu hre tawp naw ti niu; Hmu chu hmu dêng in ta chu, hriet ruok chu hre tawp naw ti niu;"
"For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.","Hi chihai lungril hi a lo ngawng tah a, An nahai a lo sêt tah a, An mit an insîm bawk a. Chuong naw chun an mitin hmûng an ta, An nain hrieng an ta, An lungrilin hre bawk an ta, Ngha kîr nâwk an ta, Keiin anni sukdam hlau rawi ka tih,’ a ti kha."
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.","“Nangni mit chu a vângnei a nih, a hmu hlak leiin; in na khawm a vângnei a nih, a hriet hlak leiin."
"For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, zâwlnei tamtakhai le mi fel tam- takhai khawmin, in thil hmuhai hi hmu an inhâwk a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu si nawh a; in thil hriethai khawm hi hriet an inhâwk a; nisienlakhawm, an hriet si nawh a!"
Hear then ye the parable of the sower.,"“Chuongchun, bu chi thetu tekhithu chu hre ro:"
"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the evil one, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.","Tukhawmin ram thu chu naa a lo hriet a, a ngaina a hriet si naw chun, mi suol chu a hung a, a lungrila the sa chu a lâkpêk hlak. Chu chu lampui sîra the chu a nih."
"And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;","Chun, pielthlêng hmuna the chu, thu hre a, lâwmtaka pawm nghâl hlak hi a nih;"
"yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.","nisienlakhawm, amaa chun zung a um naw leiin sâwt nawte chau a um a; chun, thu lei chun, rinumna amanih, suknawmnatna amanih a hung um phingleh a tlu nghâl el hlak."
"And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.","Chun, hlohlingnei laia the chu, thu hretu a na; nisienlakhawm, khawvêl lungkhamna le hausakna hlêmna chun thu chu a dîp a, ra loin a um hlak."
"And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.","Chun, leihnuoi ṭha chunga the chu, thu chu naa hre a, a ngaina hre bawk hi a nih. Chu chu a ra ngei a, ṭhenkhat a lêt za dâm, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwmruk dâmin, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwmthum dâmin a pung hlak,” a ta."
"Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:","Tekhithu dang an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Vân ram chu, mi a loa chi ṭha thetu le chun hrilkhi a nih;"
"but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.","nisienlakhawm, mi an in kârin a hmêlma a hung a, bu lai chun bu tehlêm a the a, a fe hmang nâwk tah a."
"But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.","Chun, bu chu a hung mâwng a, a hung vui chun, bu tehlêm chu a hung inlang ve tah a."
"And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?","Chun, in neitu suokhai chu an hung a, a kuoma chun, ‘Pu, i loah chi ṭha i the a ni naw am a nih? bu tehlêm saw khâwlaia hung um am a ni leh?’ an ta."
"And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, ‘Chu chu hmêlmain a lo thaw a ni ta chu,’ a ta. Chun, suokhai chun a kuomah, ‘Chuong chu la khâwm el inlang rem i ti?’ an ta."
"But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.","Ama ruok chun, ‘Ti lo e; bu tehlêm chu in lâk khâwm chun bu chu phawi sa hlau rawi in tih."
"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.","Bu sîk chenin um hmun khat raw se; chun, bu sîk pha chun, bu âttuhai kuomah, bu tehlêm chu la khâwm hmasa phawt unla, raw dingin intêl ro, bu ruok chu ka inah sêk lût ro, la tîng ka tih,’ a tih a,” a ta."
"Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:","Tekhithu dang an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Vân ram chu anṭam chi mal khat mîn a lâk a, a loa a the ang chu a na;"
"which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.","chu chu chi po poa chîn tak a na: nisienlakhawm, a hung mâwng sâng pha chun, thlaihai nêk chun a lien lem a, thing a hung ni hlak a, chuongchun, chunglêng vatehai chu an hung a, a zârhaia chun an riek hlak a,” a ta."
"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.","Tekhithu dang an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Vân ram chu chawl, nu- hmeiin a ilâk, beiphit tekhâwng thum laia arênga a tho vawng hmakhata a iphûm ang chu a nih,” a ta."
All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:,"Chuong po po chu Isûn tekhi- thuin mipuihai kuomah a hril a, tekhithu nawin iengkhawm a hril nawh:"
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.","zâwlneiin, “Tekhithuin ka bau kâng ka ta, Leihnuoi insieng tîra inthawka thil inthup chu hril dawk ka tih,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
"Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.","Chu lai chun mipuihai chu a fesan a, ina chun a lût tah a; chun, a inchûktirhai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Loa bu tehlêm tekhithu kha mi hrilfie rawh,” an ta."
"And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Chi ṭha thetu chu Mihriem Naupa hi a nih;"
"and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;",Lo chu khawvêl hi a na; chi ṭhahai chu Ram nauhai an na; bu tehlêmhai chu suol nauhai an nih.
and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.,Hmêlma a thetu chu diebol a na; bu sîk chu khawvêl tâwpna ding a na; bu sîktuhai chu vântirkohai an nih.
As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.,"Chuongchun, bu tehlêmhai chu an lâk khâwma meiah an raw ang hin khawvêl tâwpnaa chun la um a tih."
"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,","Mihriem Naupa hin a vântir- kohai chu tir dawk a ta, a rama inthawka insuksuoltirtuhai le thil suksuoltuhai po po chu thlang dawk an ta,"
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"rawtuina meia chun pei an ta, chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu la um a tih."
"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.","Chu pha chun, mi felhai chu an Pa rama chun nisa angin var tâng an tih. Na nei chun hre raw se."
"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.","“Vân ram chu loa ro phûmrûk ang a nih; chu chu miin a hmuh a, a thup hmang a, a lâwm leiin a feh a, a nei po po chu a va zawr a, chu lo chu ân châwk tah a."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:","“Chun, vân ram chu sumdâwng mi lunghlu ṭhatak zawngtu ang chu a ni nâwk a,"
"and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.","chun, ama chun lunghlu hlutak pakhat a hmuh a, a fe tah a, a nei po po chu a va zawr a, ân châwk tah a."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:","“Chun, vân ram chu lênkhang tuisuorieta dênga, chi tinrêng fûn khâwmna ang chu a ni nâwk bawk a."
"which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.","Chu chu a sip phingleh va- pangah an hnûk dawk a; chun, an ṭhung a, a ṭha po chu bâwmah an lâk khâwm a, a sie ruok chu an pei a."
"So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,","Khawvêl tâwp pha chun chuong ang bawk chun la um a tih; vân- tirkohai chu hung suok an ta, mi fel laia inthawkin mi suol hai chu ṭhêng an ta,"
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"rawtuina meia chun pei an ta; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih,” a ta."
"Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Chuong po po chu in hriet am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Hre e,” an ta."
"And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Chuong a ni chun Dân inchûktirtu vân ram lampui inchûktira um taphawt chu, in neitu, a ro bâwma inthawka thil tharhai le, thil hluihai phawr dawk hlaktu ang chu a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.","Chun, Isûn chuong tekhithuhai chu a hril zo phingleh, chutaka inthawk chun a fe tah a."
"And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?","Chun, a umna khuo tieng chu a tlung a, an inkhawmna ina chun anni ân chûktir tah a; chuongchun, mak an ti hle a. “Hi mipa hin, hieng varna le, thilmak thaw theinahai hi, khâw- laia inthawka a hmu am a ni leh?"
"Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?","Hi mi pa hi thingrem siemtu naupa kha a ni naw am a nih? A unauhai khawm, Jakob, Josef, Simon, Juda an tihai chu an ni naw am a nih?"
"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?",A farnuhai khawm ei kuoma um an ni vawng a ni naw am a nih? Hi mi hin khâwlaia inthawk hrima hieng po po hi a hmu am a na?” an ta.
"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.","Chuongchun, a chungah an lungni ta nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn an kuomah, “Zâwlnei chu ama khuo tieng le ama ina chau naw chu inpâk loin a um ngai nawh,” a ta."
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.,"Chun, an ring naw leiin chutaka chun thilmak tam a thaw ta nawh a."
"At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,","Chu lai tak chun lal Herod chun Isu chanchin a lo hriet a,"
"and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.","a siehlawhai kuomah, “Chu chu Baptistu Johan kha a ni chu, mithi laia inthawkin a tho nâwk tah a ni chu tie; chuleiin, chuong thilthaw- theinahai chun amaah sin a thaw a ni chu,” a ta."
"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.","Herod chun a unaupa Philip nuhmei Herodi leiin Johan chu a man a; a khuop a, intângna inah a khum tah a na;"
"For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.","Johan chun a kuomah, “Ama i nei hi a thieng nawh,” a ti pêk leiin."
"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.","Chun, Johan chu sukhlum a tum leh mipui a ṭih a, zâwlneiin an ruot si leiin."
"But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.","Nisienlakhawm, Herod pieng champhaphâk ni chu a hung tlungin Herodi naunu chu a laiah a lâm a, Herod chu a suklâwm tah a."
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.,"Chuleichun, a ihni taphawt pe dingin inkhâmin ân tiem tah a."
"And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.","Chun, ama chun a nu infuiin, “Hiva hin thlêngin Baptistu Johan lu mi pe rawh,” a ta."
"And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given;","Chun, lal chu a lungngai tah a; nisienlakhawm, a thutiem le a thlai- thlêng awtpuihai lei chun pêk ding thu a pêk a;"
and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.,"chuongchun, mi a tir a, intângna ina Johan lu chu ân tantir a."
"And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.","Chun, a lu chu thlêngin a hung lâk a, naupangnu kuoma chun an pêk a; ama chun a nu kuomah a fepui tah a."
"And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.","Chun, a inchûktirhai chu an hung a, a ruong chu an inhlawm a, an phûm a; chun, an feh a, Isu an va hril tah a."
"Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard thereof, they followed him on foot from the cities.","Chun, Isûn chu chu a hrietin, chutaka inthawkin thlalêr hmun tieng lawngin a tumin a fe tah a.

"And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.","Chuongchun, ama chu vapanga a suok chun, mipui nasatak a hmuh a; a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, an damnawhai a sukdam a,"
"And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.","Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, inchûktirhai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Ahi thlalêr hmun a na, an ta dinga fâk ding an inchâwk theina dingin mipuihai hi infetir ta la,” an ta."
"But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.","Isu ruok chun an kuomah, “An fe hmang a ngai nawh ie; nangniin fâk ding pe ro,” a ta."
"And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Ahin beiphêk panga le nga pahni chau kan nei a nih,” an ta."
"And he said, Bring them hither to me.","Chun, ama chun, “Ahin ka kuomah hung la ro,” a ta."
"And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.","Chun, hlo chunga ṭhung dingin mipui chu thu a pêk a, beiphêk panga le nga pahni chu a lâk a, vân tieng enin mal a sâwm a, a khawi a, beiphêk panga chu inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a; inchûktirhai chun mipui kuoma chun an pêk a."
"And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.","Chun, an rêngin an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a; an fâk mahla nawi khawm chu bâwm sâwm le pahni an rût sip a."
"And they that did eat were about five thousand men, besides women and children.",A fatuhai chu nuhmei le nau- pang tiem loin patling ruok khawm sâng nga rau an nih.
"And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân ṭîntir vêl sûngin, a fe hmaa râlkhing tienga fe dingin inchûktirhai chu lawngah ân chuongtir hrâm nghâl tah a."
"And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân ṭîntir hnungin ṭawngṭai dingin tlânga chun a tumin a hang feh a; chun, zântieng a hung ni chun ama chauin chutaka chun a um tah a."
"But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.",Lawng ruok chu dîl lailung takah a um tah a; thliin annaw tieng a mût leiin tuifâwnin a vawr tah a.
"And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.","Chun, vârṭien tâwmin dîl chunga kea lâwnin an kuom tieng a hung pan a."
"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.","Inchûktirhai chun, ama chu dîl chunga kea lâwn an hang hmu chun, “Thla a ni saw,” tiin an thlaphâng a, an ṭih a, an khêk ta rak el a."

"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.","Chun, Peterin a dawn a, “Lalpa, nang i ni chun, tui chunga i kuoma hung thu mi pe rawh,” a ta."
"And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.","Ama chun, “Hung ta la,” a ta. Peter chu lawnga inthawk chun a ṭum a, Isu kuom tieng panin tui chunga chun kein a fe tah a."

"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?","Chun, Isûn a ban nghâl tah a, ama chu a chel a, a kuomah, “Nang ringna tlâwm, iengdinga i ringhla am a na?” a ta."
"And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.","Chun, lawngah an chuong chun thli chu a ma ta el a."
"And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.","Lawnga umhai chun, “Pathien Naupa i lo ni tak zet hi,” tiin chibai an bûk a."
"And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.","Chun, râlkhing tieng an kai chun, Gennesaret ram khawmuol an tlung tah a."
"And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick;","Chu hmuna mihai chun ama an hriet phingleh, chu kâwl vêl ram po poa chun mi an tir a, damnaw po po chu a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a;"
and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.,"chun, a puon hmawr bêk them thei an hnih a; chun, a them phawt chu an hung dam ta pei a."
"Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,","Chu lai tak chun, Jerusalema inthawkin Pharisaihai le Dân inchûktirtuhai Isu kuomah an hung a,"
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.,"“Iengdinga i închûktirhaiin upa- hai thurosie chu an bawsiet hlak am a na? Bei an fâk pha kut an sâwp ngai si nawh a,” an ta."
"And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni khawm iengdinga in thu- rosie leia Pathien thupêk in bawsiet am a na?"
"For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.","Pathienin, ‘I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ ‘Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih hrilse taphawt chu thi tei tei raw se,’ a ti sih a."
"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to God;","Nangni ruok chun tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih kuoma, ‘I mi sawrna ding hi Pathien kuoma pêk a ni tah, ti taphawt chun,"
he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.,"a nu amanih, a pa amanih a chawimawi ding a ni nawh’ in ti hlak a. Chuongchun, in thurosie leiin Pathien thu chu in baw hmang tah a ni hi."
"Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,",Vervêkhai Isai hin in chung- châng thu a lo hrillâwk indik ngei el:
This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.,"‘Hi hairawi hin an bauin an mi chawimawi a, An lungril ruok chun an mi hlat sih a."
"But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, an inchûktirnaah mihriem thupêk an inchûktir leiin, An mi biek hlak hi a thlâwn el a nih,’ tiin,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:","Chun, mipui chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Ngai unla, a ngai lo thiem ro;"
"Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.","baua lût chu mihriem suk- thieng nawtu a ni nawh a, baua suok, achu ngei chu mihriem sukthieng nawtu a ni lem,” a ta."
"Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?","Chu lai chun, a inchûktirhai an hung a, a kuomah, “Pharisaihaiin kha thu kha an hriet a, an lungninaw kha i hriet am?” an ta."
"But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.","Ama ruok chun, “Kûng po po ka Pa vâna mi phun naw chu phâwi- dawkin um an tih."
"Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.","Anni chu pawisa naw ro; ṭhuoitu mitdel an nih. Chuongchun, mitdelin mitdel ma a ṭhuoi chun khurah tla rêl an tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Tekhithu kha mi hrilfie ta la,” tiin a dawn a."
"And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?","Ama chun, “Tu chen hin nangni khawm hrietna nei loin in la um rawp maw?"

But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.,Baua suokhai ruok chu lungrila hung suok a na; chuong ngei chun mihriem a sukthieng naw hlak a nih.
"For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:","Lungrila hin ngaituona suolhai, tuolthatna hai, uiretna hai, inditna hai, inrûkna hai, inhêkna hai, hrilsietna hai a hung suok hlak sih a."
these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.,"chuong chu mihriem suk- thieng nawtu a nih; kut sâwp loa bu fâk ruok chun mi a sukthieng naw nawh,” a ta."
"And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.","Chun, Isu chutaka inthawk chun a suok a; Tura le Sidon bielah a fe tah a."
"And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.","Chun, ngai ta, chuong rama in- thawk chun Kanaan nuhmei pakhat a hung suok a, “Lalpa, David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh, ka naunu khawhriin a man tlat a nih,” tiin a khêk a."
"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.","Ama ruok chun bau khat khawmin a dawn nawh. Chun, a inchûktirhai chun, “Ei hnungah a khêk a khêk sih a, infetir el ta la,” tiin an hung ngên a."
"But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","Ama ruok chun, “Israel hnam laia berâm inhmang kuoma naw chu tir ka ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
"But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.","Nisienlakhawm, nuhmei chu a hung a, “Lalpa, mi san rawh,” tiin chibai a bûk a."
"And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.","Chun, ama chun, “Nauhai bei lâkpêk a, uihai kuoma pêk chu a mawi nawh ie,” a ta, a dawn a."
"But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.","Ama chun, “Lalpa, ni chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, uihai khawmin an pu dawkâna inthawka bei nawi tla chu an fâk hlak annâwm,” a ta."
"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.","Chu phingleh Isûn a kuomah, “Nuhmei, i ringna a nasa êm el; i dit ang takin i chungah um raw se,” a ta, a dawn a. Chuongchun, a naunu chu, chu chena chun a hung dam el tah a."
"And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.","Chun, Isu chutaka inthawk chun a feh a, Galili dîl kâwl a hung tlung a; chun tlânga chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun a ṭhung tah a."
"And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them:","Chun, mipui nasatak, kebaihai, mitdelhai, ṭawngtheinawhai, pieng- suolhai hung ṭhuoiin a kuomah an hung a, a ke bulah an sieh a; chun, a lo sukdam tâwl a."
"insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, mipui chun, ṭawngtheinawhai chu hung ṭawng a, piengsuolhai chu hung ṭhah a, kebaihai chu kea lâwn a, mitdelhai chu hmu theia an hmuin, mak an ti hle a; chuongchun, Israelhai Pathien chu an inpâk tah a."
"And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.","Chun, Isûn a inchûktirhai chu a ko a, “Mipuihai hi tuhin ka kuomah ni thum an um tah a, fâk ding iengkhawm an nei naw leiin ka lungsiet bêk bêk a nih; bu ngheiin kân fetir nuom nawh ie, chuong naw chun lam kârah châu rawi an tih,” a ta."
"And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?","Chun, inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Mipui hieng zât zât khawpna khawp beiphêk chuong zât lâwm lâwm thlalêrah khâwlai am hmûng kan ta?” an ta."
"And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.","Chun, an kuomah, “Beiphêk iengzât am in nei a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Phêk sari, ngatê tlâwmte leh,” an ta."
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;,Ama chun hnuoia ṭhung dingin mipui chu thu a pêk a.
"and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.","Chun, bei pasari le ngatê chu a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril a, a khawi a, inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a; inchûktirhai chun mipuihai kuomah an pêk a."
"And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.","Chun, an rêngin an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a, an fâk mahla khawm chu bâwmrâng sari an rût sip a."
"And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.",A fatuhai chu nuhmei le nau- pang tiem loin patling ruok khawm sâng li an nih.
"And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân ṭintir hnungin lawngah a chuong a, Magadan ram a hung tlung a."
"And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven.","Chun, Pharisaihai le Saddu- kaihai an hung a, ama fiena dingin vâna inthawka inchikna anni inentir dingin an hnih a."
"But he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the heaven is red.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Zântieng a hung ni pha, ‘Khuo a ṭha ding nîng a tih, kâwl a sen êm el,’ in ti hlak a."
"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day: for the heaven is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern the face of the heaven; but ye cannot discern the signs of the times.","Chun, a zîngkâr chun, ‘Vawisûn chu khuo a se ding nîng a tih, kâwl a sen a, vân ân nîm êm el,’ in ti hlak a.

"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.","Ruolthar suol tak le uire hmang- hai chun inchikna an zawng a; nisienlakhawm, Jona inchikna chau naw chu an kuomah inchikna hrim pêk ni naw ni,” a ta, a dawn a.

And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread.,"Chun, inchûktirhai chu râlkhing tieng an tlung chun, bei an lo chawi theinghil a,"
"And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.","Isûn an kuomah, “Pharisaihai le Saddukaihai chawla inthawk chun invêng unla, fîmkhur ro,” a ta."
"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread.","Chun, anni chun, “Bei ei chawi dêr nawh,” tiin an inngaituoh a."
"And Jesus perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have no bread?","Chun, Isûn chu chu a hriet a, “Ringna tlâwmhai, iengdinga bei in nei naw leia in inngaituo am a na?"
"Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?","Tu khawm hin in lungrilin in la hriet naw rawp maw? Mi sâng nga beiphêk panga le, in bâwm rût sip zât kha in hriet zing naw am a nih?"
"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?","Mi sâng li beiphêk pasari le, in bâwmrâng rût sip zât khawm kha?"
How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.,"Bei thu in kuomah ka hril nawh ti iengtiziea in hriet naw am a na? Pharisaihai le Saddukaihai chawla inthawk ruok chun fîmkhur ro,” a ta."
"Then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.","Chu phingleh, bei chawla inthawka fîmkhur dingin a ti nawh a, Pharisaihai le Saddukaihai inchûk- tirnaa inthawka fîmkhur dingin anni a ti lem ti an hung hriet tah a."
"Now when Jesus came into the parts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?","Chun, Isu chu Philip Kaisari biel a hung tlung chun, a inchûktirhai kuomah, “Mihaiin Mihriem Naupa hi tu am a nih an tih a?” tiin ân dawn a."
"And they said, Some say John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.","Anni chun, “Ṭhenkhatin, ‘Bap- tistu Johan an ti che a,’ ṭhenkhatin, ‘Elija’, ṭhenkhatin, ‘Jeremia amanih, zâwlnei tu amanih’ an ti che” an ta."
"He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am?","Ama chun an kuomah, “An leh, nangnîn tu am a nih in mi tih a?” a ta."
"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.","Simon Peterin, “Krista Pathien hring Naupa chu I nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Simon Bar-Jona, i hamṭha ie; tisa le thisenin ân hriettir che a ni si nawh a, ka Pa vâna mîn ân hriettir lem che a nih."
"And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.","Chun, nang Peter i nih ti ka hril che; hi lungpui chunga hin ka kohran rem ka ta, mithi khuo kul kawtkhârhai chun chu chu ngam naw ni hai."
I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.,"Vân ram chabihai pêng ka ti cheh a, hnuoi chunga iengkhawm i phuor taphawt vânah phuor ning a ta; hnuoi chunga iengkhawm i sût taphawt chu vânah sût ning a tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
Then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.,Chu hnunga chun Krista a ni ti tukhawm hril lo dingin inchûktirhai chu a ti tlat a.
"From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.","Chu chena inthawk chun, Isûn Jerusalema a fe dingzie dâm, upahai, thiempu lalhai, Dân inchûktirtuhaia inthawka thil tamtak a tuor dingzie dâm, sukhluma a um dingzie dâm le ni thum nia keithoa a um dingzie dâm chu a inchûktirhai chu ân hriettir phut tah a."
"And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee.","Chun, Peter chun ama chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a, “Lalpa, Pathienin lunginsiet raw se che!; chuong chu i chungah tlung naw tawp a tih,” tiin a kâwk tah a."
"But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.","Ama ruok chu a nghah a, Peter kuoma chun, “Setan, ka hnungah fe rawh, keia ta dingin tlûkna i nih; Pathien thil ngaituo loin mihriem thil i ngaituo lem a ni hi,” a ta."
"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.","Chun, Isûn a închûktirhai kuomah, “Tukhawmin mi zui a nuom chun, mâni inhnâwlin, a kraws putin, mi zui raw se."
For whosoever would save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.,Tukhawm a hringna hum nuom taphawt chun chân a tih; tukhawm keia leia hringna chân phawt chun hum a tih.
"For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?","Mîn khawvêl hi a pumin nei sien, ama hringna chân si sienla, a ta dingin ieng am ṭhahnem a ta? Annawleh, mîn a hringna sikin ieng am pêng a ta?"
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds.,"Mihriem Naupa hi a vântir- kohai leh, a Pa ropuinaa inthuomin a hung ding a ni sih a; chu pha chun mi tin an thilthaw ang peiin thung seng a tih."

"And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:","Chun, ni ruk hnung chun Isûn Peter hai, Jakob hai, a unau Johan hai a ṭhuoi a, a tumin tlâng insângtakah a hang fepui a;"

"And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him.","Chun, ngai ta, Mosie le Elija chu ama le inbien an kuomah an ngîr a."
"And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.","Chun, Peterin Isu a biek a, “Lalpa, ei ta dingin hitaka um hi a ṭha; i nuom chun hitaka hin bâwkte pathum khâwng ka ta; i ta dingin pakhat, Mosie ta dingin pakhat, Elija ta dingin pakhat,” a tih a."
"While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.","A la hril lai zingin ngai ta, sûm vârtakin anni a hung hlie tah a; chun, ngai ta, sûma inthawk râwlin, “Hi hi ka Naupa dittak, ka ilâwm bêk bêk chu a nih, ama thu ngai ro,” a ta."
"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.","Inchûktirhai chun chu chu an hrietin bawkkhupin an tluh a, an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
"And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid.","Chun, Isûn anni chu a hung them a, “Tho unla, ṭi naw ro,” a ta."
"And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only.","Chun, an hang dâk a, Isu chau naw chu tukhawm an hmu ta nawh a."
"And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead.","Chun, tlânga inthawka an ṭum lai chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Mihriem Naupa hi mithi laia inthawka a thonâwk hmakhat chu in thil hmu kha tukhawm hril naw ro,” tiin thu a pêk tah a."

Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.,"Chu phingle chun inchûktirhai chun, Baptistu Johan thu an kuomah a hril a ni ti an lo hriet tah a."
"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying,","Chun, mipui kuom an hung tlung chun, mi pakhat a kuomah a hung a, a hmaa dingṭhaṭhuonin,"

"Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.","Chun, an fe hnungin, ngai ta, Lalpa vântirko Josef kuomah a mangah ân lâr a, “Tho la, nautê le a nu ṭhuoi la, Aigupta ramah tlân hmang rawh, ka hril nâwk hmakhat che chu chutaka chun um zing rawh; Herodin nautê sukbo dingin a zawng ding a nih,” a ta."

"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men.","Chun, Herodin mi varhai hlêmin a um ti ân hriet phingin a lung a sen bêk bêk a, mi a tir a, a hun laitak thu mi varhai nguntaka ân dawn suo ang khan, Bethlehem le a vêl po poa pasal naupang kum hnia inthawka hnuoitieng po po chu an rêngin a that ta vawng a."
"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,",Chuong lai chun zâwlnei Jeremiain hieng thu a hril hi a hung tlung tah a:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she would not be comforted, because they are not.","“Rama khuoah khêkri an hriet a, Ṭap dâm, mithi ngaia khêk rawng rawng dâm; Rakil chun a nauhai a ṭah a, An um ta naw leiin thlamuong thei a ni nawh,” ti hi."
"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Herod chu a thi hnungin, ngai ta, Lalpa vântirko Aiguptaa chun Josef kuomah mangah ân lâr a,"
"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.","“Tho la, nautê le a nu ṭhuoi la, Israel ramah fe rawh; nautê that tumtuhai kha an thi tah,” a ta."
"And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.","Chuongchun, a tho a, nautê le a nu chu a ṭhuoi a, Israel ramah a lût tah a."
"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judæa in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,","Nisienlakhawm, Arkelaus a pa Herod aiawin ân lal ti a hrietin chutaka fe chu a ṭi tah a; chun, a manga hrila a um leiin Galili tieng a fe ta dai a."
"and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.","Khuo pakhat Nazareth an tia chun a va um tah a: “Ama chu Nazareth mi tîng an tih,” tia zâwlnei baua an hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.","“Vân ram chu in neitupa, a grêp huona sinthawtuhai ruoi dinga zîngkâr inhmataka suok ang chu a ni sih a."
"And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.","Chun, ama chun, sinthawtuhai le chun ni khata dulil hlaw dinga an inrem phingleh, huona chun a tir tâwl tah a."
"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle;","Chun, vairik lai vêlin a va suok a, mi dang dâwr hmuna ngîr mei meihai a hmuh a;"
"and to them he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.","an kuomah, ‘Nangni khawm grêp huonah va fe ta u, a mawi tâwk ang pei pêng ka ti cheu,’ a ta. Chuongchun, an fe tah a."
"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.","Chun, nisa inding vêl le zân bu suong pha vêl lai chun a va suok nâwk a; chuong ang bawkin a thaw nâwk a."
"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?","Chun, zântieng chun a va suok a; mi dang lo ngîrhai chu a hmu a; an kuomah, ‘Iengdinga sûnnithlâka hitaka ngîr mei mei cheu am?’ a ta."
"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.","Anni chun a kuomah, ‘Tu- khawmin an mi ruoi naw leiin,’ an ta. Ama chun an kuomah, ‘Nangni khawm grêp huonah va fe ta u,’ a ta."
"And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.","“Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, grêp huon neitupa chun a sum en- kawltu kuomah, ‘Sinthawtuhai kha ko la, a nuhnungtaka phutin a hma- satak chenin an hlaw pe rawh,’ a ta."
"And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.","Chun, zântienga a iruoihai chu an hung chun duli an hmu seng a."
"And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.","Chun, a hmasatakhai an hung chun hmu tam deu an inring a; nisienlakhawm, anni khawm chun duli bawk an hmu seng a."
"And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,","Chuongchun, an lâk lai chun, in neitupa chungah an chier a,"
"saying, These last have spent but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.","‘Hieng a nuhnungtakhai hin darkâr khat chau an thawh a, keini sûn rinum le khawsa dotuhai tlukin i siem sih a,’ an ta."
"But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a shilling?","Ama ruok chun anni laia mi pakhat kuomah, ‘Ruola, i chungah iengkhawm ka suksuol lêm; duli hlaw dingin ei inrem naw am a nih?"
"Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.","I ta kha la la fe el rawh; nang ka ipêk che ang bawk kha, hi a nuhnung tak kuoma khawm hin ka pêk nuom a nih."
"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?","Ka ta nâknâk chu ka nuom ang anga ka thaw a thieng naw am a nih? Annawleh, kei ka ṭhat leiin nangin i thîk am a nih?’ tîn a dawn a."
"So the last shall be first, and the first last.","Chuongangin a nuhnungtak- hai chu a hmasatak la nîng an ta, a hmasatakhai khawm chu a nu- hnungtakhai la nîng an tih,” a ta."
"And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,","Chun, Isu Jerusalema a hang fe laiin, inchûktirhai sâwm le pahni chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a, lampuia chun an kuomah,"
"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,","“Ngai ta u, Jerusalemah ei fe ding a ni hi. Mihriem Naupa hi thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai kutah inmantirin a um ding a nih; chun, anni chun thi dingin a chungah thu sukthlûng an ta;"
"and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.","nuiza siemna dinga hmang ding le, vuok ding le krawsa hemde dingin Jentailhai kuomah pêng an tih; chun, ni thum niin keithoin um a tih,” a ta."
"Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping him, and asking a certain thing of him.","Chu lai chun, Zebedai naupa- salhai nu chu, a naupahai ṭhuoiin a kuomah a hung a, chibai a bûk a, ieng amanih a hnih a."
"And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ieng am i dit a?” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Hieng ka naupahai pahni hi i ramah i changtiengah pakhat, i vawitiengah pakhat an ṭhung theina dingin thu pe ta la,” a ta."
"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able.","Isu ruok chun “In hni hi in hriet naw a nih, ka no dâwn ding chu in dâwn thei am a nih?” a ta, a dawn a. Annîn a kuomah, “Thei e,” an ta."
"He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared of my Father.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka no chu dâwn ngei in tih; nisienlakhawm, ka changtieng le ka vawitienga ṭhung ding thu chu keia pêk ding a ni nawh a, ka Pa ibuotsaipêkhai ta ding ni lem a tih,” a ta."
"And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.","Chun, sâwm hai chun chu chu an lo hrietin unau pahni hai chunga chun an lunginsen tah a."
"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.","Isu ruok chun anni chu a ko a, “Jentailhai chunga rorêltuhai chu an chungah an inlal bêk bêk hlak a, an mi lienhai chun an chungah thu an nei bêk bêk hlak ti in hriet."
Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;,"Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia chu chuong ang chu ni naw ni, tukhawm nangni laia mi lien ni nuom phawt chu in rawngbâwltuin a um ding a nih,"
and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant:,tukhawm nangni laia a hma- satak ni nuom taphawt chu in sie- hlawin a um bawk ding a nih;
"even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.","Mihriem Naupa hi rawng- bâwlpêka um dinga hung a ni nawh a, rawngbâwl ding le mi tamtak intlan- na dinga, a hringna pe lem dinga a hung ang hin,” a ta."
"And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.","Chun, Jerikoa inthawka an suok laiin mipui nasatakin ama an zui a."
"And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.","Chun, ngai ta, mitdel pahni lam sîra ṭhunghai chun Isu a fe ti an hriet phingleh, “Lalpa, David Naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin an khêk a."
"And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.","Chun, mipui chun to dingin an hal a; nisienlakhawm, anni chun “Lalpa, David Naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin an khêk nâwk zuol a."
"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?","Chun, Isu a ngîr a, anni a ko a, “In chungah ieng ang am ka thaw in nuom a?” a ta."
"They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, mit var kan nuom,” an ta."
"And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.","Chuongchun, Isûn a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, an mit a them a; chuongchun, an hmu thei nghâl tah a, ama chu an zui tah a."
"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,","Chun, Jerusalem an tlung dinga Bethphage khuo, Oliv tlâng chu an tlung chun Isûn a închûktirhai pahni a tir a,"
"saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.","an kuomah, “In hma zâwna khuoa sawn va fe unla, sabengtung thlung, a kâwla a tê leh hmûng in ta; sût unla, ka kuomah hung kei ro."
"And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.","Tukhawmin in kuomah, ieng- khawm an lo hril chun, ‘Lalpain a mamaw a nih,’ tîng in ta; chun, ama chun hung tîr nghâl el a tih,” a ta."
"Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,",Zâwlnei baua hieng thu hrila um ta kha a hung tlung theina dingin chuong chu a hung um ta a nih.
"Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, Meek, and riding upon an ass, And upon a colt the foal of an ass.","“ ‘En ta, i Lal chu thuhnuoirawltakin, Sabengtung chungah, sabengtungtê chunga ngeia chuongin, I kuomah a hung ding a nih,’ tiin, Zion naunu chu hril rawh,” ti hi."
"And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,","Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chu an va feh a, Isûn an kuoma thu a pêk ang ngeiin an thawh a,"
"and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.","sabengtung le a tê chu an hung kei a, an chunga chun puonhai an phah a, ama chun a chuongpha tah a."
"And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way.","Chun, mipui laia a tam lemin lampuia chun an puonhai an phah a, mi dangin thinga sâwlhna an sât a, lampuiah an pha bawk a."
"And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.","Chun, mipui a hma tienga fe le a zuihai chun, “David naupa kuomah Hosanna! Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se! Achunghnungtaka khin, Hosanna!” tiin an khêk a."
"And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?","Chun, Jerusalem a lût chun, a khuoin, “Hi mipa hi tu am a na?” tiin an inhnîng sup sup a."
"And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.","Chun, mipuihai chun, “Hi hi zâwlnei Isu, Galili rama, Nazaretha mi chu a nih,” an ta."
"And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;","Chun, Isu Pathien biekina chun a va lût a, biekina iengkhat zawrtuhai le inchawtuhai po po chu a hnawt dawk a, tangka thlengtuhai dawkânhai le vaṭhu zawrhai ṭhung- phahai dâm chu a nam thlûkpêk a,"
"and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers.","an kuomah, “ ‘Ka in chu ṭawngṭaina in tîng an tih,’ ti ziek a na, nangni ruok chun suomhmanghai pûkin in siem lem hlak a nih,” a ta."
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.,"Chun, Pathien biekina chun mitdelhai le kebaihai a kuomah an hung a, anni a sukdam a."
"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,","Nisienlakhawm, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun a thilmak thawhai le, biekina, “David naupa kuomah Hosanna” tia, naupang khêkhai chu an hmuin, an lungninaw bêk bêk a,"
"and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?","a kuomah, Hienghai thu hril hi i hriet am?” an ta. Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Hre e: ‘Nautêhai le nene ne laihai baua suok chun, Inpâkna i sukṭhafamkim tah,’ ti hi in tiem ngai naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.","Chun, anni chu a mâksan a, khawpuia inthawk chun a suok a, Bethaniah a feh a; chutaka chun a riek tah a."
"Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.","Chun, zîngkâra khawpui tienga a kîr nâwk laiin a phîng a hung ṭâm tah a."
"And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.","Chun, lam sîra chun theichang kûng a hmuh a, a va pan a, a hna chau naw chu iengkhawm a hmu nawh a."
"And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?","Chun, a kuomah, “Kumkhaw- tluongin lo ra ta dêr naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, theichang chu a thêm nghâl el tah a. Chun, inchûktirhai chun chu chu an hmuin, “Iengtiziea theichang hi a thêm nghâl el am a na?” tiin mak an ti hle a."
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Titak- zetin ka hril cheu hi, ringna in nei a, in ringhla naw chun, theichang chunga thaw ang chau hi thaw naw ti niu a, hi tlâng kuoma khawm hin, ‘Lo insawn la tuisuorietah lo inpei rawh,’ in ti chun, in ti ang chun lo um a tih."
"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.","Chun, iengkim ringtaka ṭawng- ṭaia in hni taphawt chu hmûng in tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
"And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?","Chun, Pathien biekina a lût hnunga ân chûktir lai chun, thiempu lalhai le vântlâng upahai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Tu thuin am hieng thil hi i thaw a?

"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei khawmin thu bau khat indawn vêng ka ti cheu, chu chu in mi hril chun tu thuin am hieng thilhai hi ka thaw, hril vêng ka ti cheu."
"The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?","Johan baptisma kha khâwlaia mi thu am a na? Vâna mi thu am a ni mihriem thu?” a ta, a dawn a. Chun, an inngaituoh a, “Vâna mi thu, ei ti chun, ‘Iengdinga a thu in awi naw am a na’ mi ti sîng a ta."
"But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.","Chun, ‘Mihriem thu’ ei ti chun mipui chu ei ṭi sih a; mi po poin Johan chu zâwlneiin an ngai sih a,” an ta."
"And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Chuongchun, Isu an dawn a, “Kan hriet nawh,” an ta. Ama khawm chun an kuomah, “Kei khawmin tu thuin am hieng thil hi ka thawh a hril bîk naw ning cheu."
"But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.","“Nisienlakhawm, nangnîn ieng- tin am in ngai a? Mi tuin amanih naupasal pahni a nei a. Pakhat kuoma chun a va feh a, ‘Ka nau, vawisûn grêp huonah sin va thaw rawh,’ a ta."
"And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.","Ama chun, ‘Ka nuom nawh,’ a ta, a dawn a; nisienlakhawm, a nakie chun a lungril ân thleng a, a fe tah a."
"And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.","Chun, pakhat kuoma khawm chun a va feh a, chuong ang bawkin a va ta. Ama chun, ‘Pu, fêng ka tih’ a ta, a dawn a, nisienlakhawm, a fe ta si nawh a."
"Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.","Chuonghai pahni atu lem chun am an pa dit zâwng an thawh a?” a ta. Anni chun, “A hmasa lem chun,” an ta. Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, siedâwltuhai le nawchi- zawrhai chun, Pathien ramah an lût khal ding cheu a ni hi."
"For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.","Johan chu felna kawnga chun in kuomah a hung a, ama chu in awi si nawh a; nangni chu in hmu hnung khawmin ama chu in awi theina dingin in inlet chuong si nawh a."
"Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.","“Tekhithu dang ngai ro, mi tu amanih in neitu a um a, ama chun grêp huon a siem a, palin ân huon vêl a, grêp sâwrna khur a cho a, in insâng a bâwl a; chun, lo enkawltuhai kuomah thlohlaw dingin a pêk a, ram dangah a fe tah a."
"And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.","Chun, a ra lo a hun ding chun, a ra lo dingin lo enkawltuhai kuomah a suokhai a tir a."
"And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.","Chun, lo enkawltuhai chun a suokhai chu an lo man a, pakhat an vuok a, pakhat an sukhlum a, pakhat lungin an dêng a."
"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.","Chun, suok dang a hmasa pâwl nêka tam lem a tir nâwk a; annihai chunga khawm an hmaa mihai an thaw ang bawkin an lo thaw nâwk a."
"But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.","Chu hnunga ruok chun, ‘Ka naupa hi chu inza ngei an tih,’ tiin a naupa chu an kuomah a tir a."
"But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.","Nisienlakhawm, lo enkawltuhai chun a naupa chu an lo hmu phingleh, ‘Hi mipa hi rohluotu ding chu a nih; that ei tiu a, a ro hluo ding hi nei pêk ei tiu,’ an ta."
"And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.","Chuongchun, ama chu an man a, grêp huona inthawk chun an pei dawk a, an sukhlum tah a."
"When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?","Chuongchun, grêp huon neitupa a hung pha chun chuong lo enkawltuhai chunga chun iengtin am thaw tâng a ta le?” a ta."
"They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Chuong mi suolhai chu rimsitakin sukbo- hmang a ta, grêp huon chu lo enkawltu dang, a lo pha poleh rahai chu a kuomah pe pei dinghai kuomah thlohlaw dingin pêng a tih,” an ta."
"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from the Lord, And it is marvellous in our eyes?","Isu chun an kuomah, “Pathien lekhaa, ‘In bâwltuhai lung dit naw kha, Chu ngei chu a kia lung ṭhangkai tak a hung ni tah. Chu chu Lalpa thaw a na, Ei mithmua hin a mak a nih,’ ti hi in tiem ngai naw am a nih?"
"Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.","“Chuleichun, ‘Pathien ram chu in kuoma inthawkin lâk hmang nîng a ta, ra insuo ding hnam kuomah pêk nîng a tih,’ ti ka hril cheu hi."
"And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.","Chun, chu lung chunga tlu chu kawi dar a ta; a idel lem chu râwt nawi tih” a ta."
"And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chun a tekhithuhai chu an hrietin, anni chungthu a hril ti an hriet tah a."
"And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.","Chun, ama chu man an tum a; nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chu an ṭi sih a, zâwlneiin an ruot leiin."
"And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,","Chun, Isûn anni a biek a, an kuomah tekhithuin a hril nâwk a,"
"The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,","“Vân ram chu lal tu amanih, a naupa ta dinga inneina ruoiṭhena siem le chun tekhi a nih."
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.,"Chun, inneina ruoiṭhe fa dinga a fielhai chu ko dingin a suokhai a tir a; nisienlakhawm, an hung nuom nawh a."
"Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.","Chun, ama chun, ‘Ka ifielhai kuoma khan, ngai ta u, ka ruoi chu kân zo tah; ka bâwngchalhai le ka ran châwm thauhai ka that a, iengkim inzo a ni tah, inneina ruoi fa dingin hung ta ro ti ro,’ tiin suok dang a tir nâwk a."
"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;","Nisienlakhawm, an lo ngaisak nawh a, an fe hmang el ta a, pakhat chu loah a feh a, pakhat chu sum- dâwngnaah,"
"and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.","mi danghai chun a suokhai chu an man a, inzakumtakin an siem a, an sukhlum el tah a."
"But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.","Chuongchun, lal chu a lunginsen tah a; a sipaihai a tir a, chuong tuolthathai chu a sukbo a, an khuo khawm a rawpêk tah a."
"Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.","“Chun, a suokhai kuoma chun, ‘Inneina ruoi inzo a ni tah; fielhai ruok kha chu fa tlâk an ni nawh."
"Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.","Chuongchun, lampêt ṭhuom- haiah fe unla, mi in hmu taphawt inneina ruoi fa dingin fiel ro,’ a ta."
"And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.","Chuongchun, chu suokhai chu an suok a, lampuihaia chun an va feh a, an hmu taphawt, mi suol le mi ṭhahai khawm an ṭhuoi khâwm ta vawng a; chuongchun, inneina ruoi pindan chu mi fiel haiin an lo sip tah a."

"For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,","Chuong ni tuilêt hmahai chun, Noa lawnga a lût ni chenin an fâkin an dâwn a, nuhmei pasal an innei hlak;"
"and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.","tui a hung lêt a, an rênga a lâk hmang vawng hmakhat chu ieng- khawm an hriet nawh a; Mihriem Naupa hung nâwkna chu chuong ang bawk chu nîng a tih."
"Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left:","Chu phâ chun, loah mi pahni um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta; pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih."
"two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.","Nuhmei pahni bu râwtnawina chun bu râwtnawiin um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta; pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih."
Watch therefore: for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh.,"Chuongchun, ngaiven ro, ieng ni am in Lalpa a hung ding in hriet si nawh a."
"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.","Nisienlakhawm, hi hi hre ro, inru a hung ding pha in neituin hre sienla vêng a ta, a in inverpawptir naw ni."
Therefore be ye also ready; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.,"Chuleiin, nangni khawm inring zingin um ro, in ring naw hunah Mihriem Naupa a hung din g a ni sih a."
"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season?","“Suok ringum vartak, a puin a hun po leh an bu chan ding sem pêk dinga a sûnghai chunga hotua a siem chu tu tak am nîng a ta le?"
"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.",A pu a hung phâleh suok chuong anga thawa a hung hmu ding chu a hamṭha.
"Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a inei po po chungah hotûn siem a tih."
"But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth;","Amiruokchu, suok suol chun a lungrilin, ‘Ka pu a hung vak naw ding a nih,’ tiin,"
"and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;","a suok chanpuihai lo vaw ta sienla, mi inruihai kuomah fain dâwn sienla,"
"the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not,","chu suok pu chu a ring naw niah, a hriet naw laiin hung a ta,"
"and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.","tum hni hung insuong a ta, mi vervêkhai chan ang hung inchangtir a tih; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih."
"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.","“Chu pha chun, vân ram chu nunghâk inthieng sâwm, an khâwnvar chawia, mo neitu tuok dinga suokhai le chun, tekhi ni tâng a tih."
"And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.","Anni lai chun panga an var a, panga an invêt a."
"For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:",Ân vêthai chun an khâwnvarhai an chawiin a tui an chawisa si nawh a.
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.,"A varhai ruok chun an khâwn- vartui bûrhaiah a tui thunin, khâwn- varhai leh an chawi a."
"Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.","Chun, mo neitu chu a hung intak leiin, an rêngin an lo inlusuh a, an lo in tah a."
"But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.","Chun, zân rila chun, ‘Ngai ta u, mo neitu chu a hung ie! a tuok dingin hung suok ro khai,’ tiin khêkri a hung um tah a."
"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.","Chu phingle chun nunghâk inthienghai chu an tho vawng a, an khâwnvarhai chu an siemrêl a."
"And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.","Chun, ân vêthai chun a varhai kuomah, ‘In khâwnvartui kha mi pe ro, kan khâwnvarhai a thi ding a nih,’ an ta."
"But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.","Nisienlakhawm, a varhai chun, ‘Keini le nangni ta dingin indai naw ni; a zawrtuhai kuomah fe unla, inchaw lem ro,’ tiin an dawn a."
"And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.","Chun, inchaw dinga an fe hmang kâr chun, mo neitu chu a hung tlung tah a; chuongchun, ân zohai chu ama le chun inneina ruoi fa dingin an lût a; chun, kawt chu an khâr tah a."
"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.","Chu hnunga chun, nunghâk inthieng danghai khawm chu an hung tlung a, ‘Pu, pu, mi hawngpêk rawh,’ an ta."
"But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.","Ama ruok chun, ‘Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, ka hriet naw cheu a nih,’ a ta, a dawn a."
"Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.","Chuongchun, ngaiven ro, a ni le a hun chu in hriet si nawh a."
"For it is as when a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.","“Vân ram chu mi ram danga fe tâwma, ama suokhai koa, a sumhai an kuoma inkawltir ang chu a ni sih a."
"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.","Suok pakhat kuomah talent nga a pêk a, suok dang kuomah talent hni, suok dang kuomah talent khat: an thaw thei tâwk ding ang sengin a pêk a; chuongchun, a fe tah a."
"Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.","Chun, talent nga dawngtu chu chuonghai chun a va sumdâwng nghâl tah a, talent nga dang a sukdawk tah a."
In like manner he also that received the two gained other two.,Chuong ang bawkin talent hni dawngtu khawm chun talent hni dang a sukdawk tah a.
"But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.","Talent khat dawngtu ruok chu a va feh a, hnuoi a cho a, a pu tangka chu a thup hmang ta lem a."
"Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.","“Chun, sâwttak hnungah chuong suokhai pu chu a hung a, an kuomah a sum chanchin a sukfel a."
"And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.","Chuongchun, talent nga dawng- tu chu a hung a, talent nga dang a hung chawi a, ‘Pu, nangin talent nga i mîn kawltir kha en ta, talent nga dang ka sukdawk,’ a ta."
"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","A pu chun a kuomah, ‘Suok ṭha le ringum, i thaw ṭha ie! tlâwmte chungah ring i um a, tamtak chungah inumtir ka ti che, i pu lâwmnaah lût rawh,’ a ta."
"And he also that received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.","Chun, talent hni dawngtu khawm chu a hung a, ‘Pu, nangin talent hni i mîn kawltir kha, en ta, talent hni dang ka sukdawk,’ a ta."
"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","A pu chun a kuomah, ‘Suok ṭha le ringum, i thaw ṭha ie! tlâwmte chungah ring i um a, tamtak chungah inumtir ka ti che; i pu lâwmnaah lût rawh,’ a ta."
"And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;","“Chun, talent khat kawltu khawm chu a hung a, ‘Pu, mi ti kher kher i nih ti ka hriet che; i tu nawnaa khawm i sîk hlak a, i the dar nawnaa khawm în khâwm hlak a nih;"
"and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.","Chuongchun, ka ṭi a, ka fe a, i talent kha hnuoiah ka thup hmang a, en ta, i ta ngai kha i hmu nâwk hi,’ a ta."
"But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;","A pu chun a kuomah, ‘Suok suol le zawmthawpa, ka itu nawnaa khawm ka sîka, ka the dar nawnaa khawm kân khâwm ti i hriet maw?"
"thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.","Chuong a ni sa chun, ka tangka chu sumdâwngtuhai kuomah lo sie ding i ni ta an nâwm; chuongchun, ka hung nâwk hin ka ta hi a pung leh ka hmu nâwk ding a nih."
"Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.","Chuongchun, a talent khat kha lâkpêk unla, talent sâwm neitu kuomah pe ro."
"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.","Tukhawm a nei taphawt chu pe sâng an ta, chuongchun, hau a tih, tukhawm, a nei naw phawt chu a nei sun khawm chu lâkpêk an tih."
And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"Chun, suok ṭhahnem naw kha tuol tieng inthima chun pei dawk ro; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih,’ a ta, a dawn a."
"But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:","“Mihriem naupa ruok chu a vântirkohai po po leh a ropuinaa inthuoma a hung phâ chun, a ropuina ṭhungphaah ṭhung a ta;"
"and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;",a hmaa chun hnam tin in- khâwm an tih; berâm chingtuin kêl laia a berâmhai a ṭhe angin anni rawi chu ṭhêng a ta;
"and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.","berâmhai chu a changtieng sieng a ta, kêlhai ruok chu a vawi tieng sieng a tih."
"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:","“Chu phâ chun, Laltak chun a changtienga mihai kuomah, ‘Ka Pa vochuomhai, hung unla, khawvêl siem tîra inthawka, in ta dinga ram buotsai chu chang ro;"
"for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;","ka phîng a ṭâmin nangnîn fâk ding in mi pêk a, ka dang a chârin dâwn ding in mi pêk a; mikhuol ka niin in mîn tlung tir a;"
"naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.","saruok ka niin puon in mîn siltir a; ka damnawh a, in mi kan a, intâng inah ka umin in hung sih a,’ la tîng a tih."
"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?","“Chu phâ chun, mi felhai chun, ‘Lalpa, iengtik âm phîngṭâmin kan hmu che a, fâk ding kan pêk che? dangchârin kan hmu chea dâwn ding kan pêk che?"
"And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?",Iengtik âm mikhuolin kan hmu che a kan intlungtir che? saruokin kan hmu chea puon kan insiltir che?
"And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?","Iengtik âm damnawin amanih, intâng ina manih kan hmu chea i kuomah kan hung?’ tiin la dawn an tih."
"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me.","Chun, Laltak chun an kuomah, ‘Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hieng ka unau chîntakhai laia mi pakhat chunga in thaw chu, ka chunga thaw in nih,’ tîn la dawn a tih.”"
"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:","“Chu zoa chun a vawitienga mihai kuoma khawm chun, ‘ṭawng- sephurhai, kumkhuo mei diebol le a tirkohai ta dinga an buotsaia chun mi fe hmangsan ro;"
"for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;","ka phîng a ṭâmin nangnîn fâk ding in mi pêk nawh a; ka dang a chârin nangnîn dâwn ding in mi pêk nawh a,"
"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.","mikhuol ka niin in mîn tlungtir nawh a, saruok ka niin puon in mîn siltir nawh a; damnaw le intâng ina ka umin in mi kan si nawh a,’ la tîng a tih."
"Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?","Chu phâ chun, anni khawmin, ‘Lalpa, iengtik âm phîngṭâmin ama- nih, dangchârin amanih, mikhuolin amanih, intâng ina manih kan hmu che a, i rawng kan bâwlpêk naw che?’ tiin la dawn an tih."
"Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, ‘Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hieng mi chîntak laia mi pakhat chunga in thaw naw chu ka chunga thaw naw in nih,’ tiin la dawn a tih."
And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.,"Chun, chuonghai chu kumkhaw hremnaah fêng an ta, mi felhai ruok chu kumkhaw hringnaah fêng an tih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,","Chun, Isûn chuong thu po po chu a hril zoin, a închûktir hai kuomah,"
"Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.","“Ni hni chenah Fekân ruoi a hung um ding a nih ti in hriet a, Mihriem Naupa hi hemde dingin an inmantir ding a nih,” a ta."
"Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;","Chu lai chun, Thiempu laltak Kaiapha an ti in inhuon sûnga chun thiempu lalhai le vântlâng upahai an inkhâwm a;"
"and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.","Isu chu zâwra mana, an sukhlum theina dingin an inrâwn a."
"But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.","Nisienlakhawm, “Ruoiṭhe sûng chu ni naw sien la, chuong naw chun vântlâng lai buoina hung um rawi a tih,” an ta."
"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,","Chun, Isu Bethaniah inphâr Simon inah a um lai chun,"
"there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.","nuhmei pakhat alabastar bûra hriek rim inhnik totak chawiin a kuomah a hung a, a buthlêng awt laiin a luah a buok a."
"But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktirhaiin chu chu an hmu chun an lunginsen a."
"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.","“Iengdinga hienga a sukhmang- thai mei mei am a na? Hi hriek hi man tamtaka zawra, pasiehai kuoma pêk thei a ni sih a,” an ta."
"But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.","Isu ruok chun chu chu a hrietin an kuomah, “Nuhmei hi iengdinga in sukbuoi am a na? Ka chunga hin thil ṭhatak a thaw a nih."
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.,"Pasiehai chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um an nih annâwm, kei ruok chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um ding ka ni nawh."
"For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.","Hi hriek rim inhnik ka taksaa a ibuok hi, phûm dinga mi buotsai dingin a thaw a ni hi."
"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, khawvêl po poah khâwlai khawm hi Chanchin Ṭha hi an hrilna poah, hi nuhmei thil thaw khawm hi ama hriet zingna dingin hril ve pei an tih,” a ta."
"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,","Chu hnunga chun sâwm le pahni laia mi pakhat, Juda Iskariot an ti chu, thiempu lalhai kuomah a fe a,"
"and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.","“Ama chu inmantir ka ti cheu a ieng am mi pêng in ta?” a ta. Chun, tangka sâwmthum an bûkpêk tah a."
And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them.,Chu chena inthawk chun in- mantirna remchâng a zawng tah a.
"Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?","Chun, Chawlṭhanglo Bei Ruoi- ṭhe ni, ni hmasataka chun, inchûk- tirhai chu Isu kuomah an hung a, “Fekân ruoi bu fâkna dingin khâwlai am buotsai pêk inlang che i nuom a?” an ta."
"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.","Ama chun, “Khawpuiah tu amani kuomah fe unla, a kuomah, ‘Inchûktirtu chun, ka hun a hnai tah a; ka închûktirhai leh Fekân ruoi i inah ṭhêng kan tih, a tih,’ va ti ro,” a ta."
And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.,"Chun, Isûn an kuoma a ti ang chun inchûktirhai chun an thaw a, Fekân ruoi ding chu an buotsai tah a."
"Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, inchûktir sâwm le pahnihai leh buthlêng an awt a;"
"and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.","chun, an fâk laiin ama chun, “Titakzetin ka ti cheu hi, in laia mi pakhat hin mîn mantir a tih,” a ta."
"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?","Chun, an lungngai ta bêk bêk a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, kei am ka nih?” an ti ta seng a."
"And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.","Ama chun, “Thlênga mi purpui- tu ngei chun mîn mantir a tih."
"The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.","Mihriem Naupa hi a chanchin an ziek angtak khan a fe ding a nih, nisienlakhawm, Mihriem Naupa inman- tirtu ding mipa chung chu a rik! chu mihriem chu insieng naw sien la, a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih,” tiin a dawn a."
"And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.","Chun, ân mantirtu ding Juda chun a dawn a, “Rabbi, kei am ka nih?” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “în ti zing chu teh,” a ta."
"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.","Chun, an fâk laiin Isûn bei a lâk a, mal a sâwmpêk a, a khawi a; chun, inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a, “La unla, fa ro, hi hi ka taksa a nih,” a ta."
"And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;","Chun, no a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril a, an kuomah a pêk a, “In rêngin dâwn ro;"
"for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.","hi hi ka thisen, suolhai ngai- damna dinga mi tamtak ta dinga suok ding, thuthlungna chu a nih"
"But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.","Nisienlakhawm, ka hril cheu hi, ka Pa rama nangni le a thar ka dâwn ni a tlung hmakhat chun tuta inthawkin grêp hrui raa hi dâwn nâwk ta naw ning,” a ta."
"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.","Chun, hla an sak zoin an suok a, Oliv tlânga chun an fe tah a."
"Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Vawizân hin in rêngin ka chung- thuah lungnilovin um vawng in tih, ‘Berâm vêngtu chu vuong ka ta, berâm ruol chu indar an tih,’ ti ziek a ni sih a."
"But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thonâwk hnungin Galili ramah in hmaah fêng ka tih,” a ta."
"But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.","Peter ruok chun a kuomah, “An rêngin i chungthuah lungnilovin um- hai sien khawm, kei chu lungnilovin um nâw tawp ka tih,” tiin a dawn a."
"Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.","Isûn a kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril che, vawizân hin âr a khuong hmain, nangin vawithum mîn phat i tih,” a ta."
"Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.","Peterin a kuomah, “I thinaa chun thi ve ding ni lang khawm inphat naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuong ang bawk chun, inchûktirhai po po chun an ti ta seng a."
"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.","Chu zoa chun Isu annihai le chun, hmun pakhat Gethsemane an ti chu an tlung a, chun, ama chun a închûktirhai kuomah, “Sawtaka ka va ṭawngṭai sûng po hitaka hin lo ṭhung ro,” a ta."
"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.","Chun, Peter le Zebedai nauhai pahni chu a ṭhuoi a, a lungngaiin a lunginzîng ta bêk bêk a."
"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.","Chun, an kuomah, “Ka lungril a lungngai bêk bêk a; thina khawp rau a nih. Hitaka hin um unla mi vêngpui ro,” a ta."
"And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.","Chun, tlâwmtên hma tieng a va fe dep a, a bawkkhup a, “Aw Pa, a thei chun, hi no hin mi khêl hrâm raw se; nisienlakhawm, keima thu ni loin, nangma thu thu ni lem raw se,” tiin a ṭawngṭai a."
"And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?","Chun, inchûktirhai kuoma chun a hung a, anni chu inin a hung hmuh a, Peter kuomah, “E khai! nangnîn dârkâr khat khawm in mi vêngpui thei naw a ni maw?"
"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.","Thlêmnaa in lût nawna dingin inring zingin ṭawngṭai ro; thlarau chun chu a pei a, tisa ruok chu a hrât naw a nih,” a ta."
"Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.","Chun, vawi hninaah a va feh a, a ṭawngṭai nâwk a, “Aw Pa, ka dâwn loa hi no hin a mi khêl thei lul naw chun, nangma thu thu ni raw se,” a ta."
"And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.","Chun, a hung nâwk a, anni chu inin a hung hmu nâwk a, an îmu a suok hle sih a."
"And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.","Chun, a fe san nâwk a, a vawi thumnaah a thu hril ngai hrilin a ṭawngṭai nâwk a."
"Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Chu zoa chun, inchûktirhai kuomah a hung nâwk a, an kuomah, “Tuhin chu in unla châwl ta ro!

"Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.","Tho unla, fêng ei tiu, a mîn mantirtu ding chu a hung hnai ta hi,” a ta."
"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.","Chun, a la hril lai zingin Juda, sâwmpahni hai laia mi pakhat chu, a hung tlung tah a, ama ruol chun thiempu lalhai le upahai kuoma inthawkin mipui nasatak, kâwlhnâm le hembâwk chawiin an hung tlung bawk a."
"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.","Chun, ân mantirtu ding chun inchikna ding a lo hrillâwk hieu a, “Ka ifâwp taphawt chu ama nîng a tih, man el ro,” tiin."
"And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.","Chuongchun, Isu chu a va pan nghâl tah a. “Chibai, Rabbi,” tiin a fâwp ta ngâwi ngâwi a."
"And Jesus said unto him, Friend, do that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Ruola, i hungna san chu thaw rawh,” a ta. Chu phingleh Isu chu an chel a, an man tah a."
"And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.","Chun, ngai ta, Isu rawihai laia pakhat chun a kutin a ban a, a kâwl- hnâm a phawi a, Thiempu Laltak suok chu a sât a; a nakâwr a sât thlâkpêk a."
"Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “I kâwl- hnâm kha a sienaah sie nâwk rawh, kâwlhnâm ruoituhai po po chu kâwlhnâm bawkin an thi ding a ni sih a."
"Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?",Tukhawm hin vântirko sâng ruk hmun sâwm le hmun hni nêka tam lem mi hung tirpêk dingin ka Pa kuomah ngên thei naw dingin in mi ring am a nih?
"How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?","Nisienlakhawm, ngên ang lang, iengtin am Pathien Lekha Thu-hieng anga hung um ding thu hi-tlung thei a ti leh?” a ta."
"In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.","Chu lai chun, Isûn mipuihai kuoma chun, “Kâwlhnâmhai, hem- bâwkhai châwiin suomhmang man ding ang elin a mi man dingin in hung suok a ni maw? Pathien biekinah ni tin inchûktirin ka ṭhung hlak a, in mi man si nawh a."
"But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.","Nisienlakhawm, zâwlnei lekha thuhai a tlung theina dingin hieng po po hi a hung tlung tah a ni hi,” a ta. Chu lai chun, inchûktirhai po po chun ama an thlathlam a, an tlân hmang ta vawng a."
"And they that had taken Jesus led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.","Chun, Isu mantuhai chun, Thiempu Laltak Kaiapha ina Dân Inchûktirtuhai le upahai um khâwmnaa chun ama chu an ṭhuoi tah a."
"But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin hla- taka inthawkin ama chu a zui a, Thiempu laltak in inhuonna sûng tuol chenin; chun, a va lût a, a tâwpna hmu dingin siehlawhai lai chun a ṭhung ve a."
"Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;","Chun, ama an sukhlum theina dingin thiempu lalhai le rorêltuhai po po chun Isu hêkna an zawng a;"
"and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,","hretu tehlêm tamtak hung hai sien khawm an hmu si nawh a. A nakie ruok chun mi pahni an hung a,"
"and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.","“Hi mipa hin, ‘Pathien biekin hi ṭhiek a, ni thum sûnga bâwl nâwk thei ka nih,’ a tih,” an ta."
"And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?","Chuongchun, Thiempu Laltak chu a ngîr suok a, a kuomah, “Iengkhawmin i dawn naw maw? Hienghaiin an hêkna che hi iengtizie am a na?” a ta. Isu ruok chu a to zing a."
"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun a kuomah, “Pathien hring hmingin ka vau che, Krista, Pathien Naupa chu i ni am a nih? mi hril rawh,” a ta."
"Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.","Isûn a kuomah, “I hril ang chun ka nih; chu nawa khawm, ka hril cheu hi, hi hnung leh Mihriem Naupa hi thilthawtheina changtienga ṭhunga, vân sûm chunga hung in la hmu ding a nih,” a ta."
"Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, “Pathien a hrilsiet tah; hretu dang iengdingin am ngai tâng ei ta? Ngai ta u, Pathien a hrilsietzie chu tuhin in hriet tah. Iengtin am in ngai a?” a ta."
"what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.","Anni chun, “Thi tlâk a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
"Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,","Chun, a hmaiah chil an sâk a, kutin an hnawk a;"
"saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?","chun, aṭhen chun, “Nang Krista, tuin am a ben cheh a? mi hril rawh,” tiin an ben a."
"Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilæan.","Chun, Peter chu in inhuon sûng tuollaia chun a ṭhung a; chun, nunghâk pakhat a kuomah a hung a, “Nang khawm, Isu, Galili rama mi kuoma um kha i ni hi,” a ta."
"But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.","Ama ruok chun, “I thu hril chu ka hriet dêr nawh,” tiin an rênga hmaah ân phat a."
"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.","Chun, tuol kawt bula chun a va suok phingleh nunghâk dangin ama chu a hmuh a, chutaka umhai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa khawm hi Isu Naza- reth mi kuoma um kha a ni hi,” a ta."
"And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.","Chun, “Chu mihriem chu ka hriet nawh,” tiin inkhâmin ân phat nâwk a."
"And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.","Chun, sâwt nawte hnungah a kâwla ngîrhai chun Peter kuomah, “Nang khawm an laia mi i ni ngei el, i ṭawngah ân hriet annâwm,” an ta."
"Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.","Ama chun, “Chu mihriem chu ka hriet nawh” tîn ṭawngsie inphur rauin ân khâm tah a. Chun âr a khuong nghâl tah a."
"And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.","Chun, Peter chun, Isûn “âr a khuong hmain nangin vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a ti kha a hung hriet nâwk tah a. Chun, a suok a, a ṭap ta ngâwi ngâwi a."
"Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:","Chun, zîngkâr a hung ni chun, thiempu lalhai le vântlâng upahai po po chu Isu sukhlum dingin a chungthuah an inrâwn a;"
"and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.","chun, an khuop a, an ṭhuoi a, Bawrsâp Pilat kuomah an pêk tah a."
"Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,","Chun, Juda ân mantîrtu khan Isu thiemnaw an inchangtir ti a hriet phingleh ân sîr a; tangka sâwmthum kha thiempu lalhai kuoma chun a hung chawi nâwk a,"
"saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou to it.","“Mi thiem thisen kân mantir kha thil ka suksuol a nih,” a ta. Anni ruok chun, “Chu chu kan ta dingin ieng am pawi a ta? Nangin i thaw thawin thaw rawh,” an ti san a."
"And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.","Chun, ama chun tangka chu hmun inthienga chun a pei lût a; a fe hmang a, a vân âwkhlum tah a."
"And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.","Chun, thiempu lalhai chun tangka chu an lâk a, “Hi hi thawlâwm bâwma sie a thieng nawh ie, thisen man a ni sih a,” an ta."
"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.","Chuongchun, an inrâwn a, mikhuolhai phûmna dingin bêlhemtu hmun chu an inchâwk tah a."
"Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.","Chu lei chun a nih, chu hmun chu tu chena, “Thisen Hmun,” an ti chu."
"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom certain of the children of Israel did price;","Chu lai chun, zâwlnei Jeremiain hieng thu a hril hi a hung tlung tah a: “Chun, tangka sâwmthum, An isak man, Israel thla tuhaiin amanih an isak man chu, An lâk a;"
"and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.","Lalpain a mi tiem angin, Belhemtu hmun man dingin an pêk a,” ti hi."
"Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.","Chun, Isu chu Bawrsâp hmaa chun a ngîr a. Chun, Bawrsâp chun, “Judahai lal i ni?” tîn ân dawn a. Chun, Isûn, “I hril ang chun ka nih,” a ta."
"And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le upa- haiin an hêk laiin iengkhawmin a dawn nawh a."
"Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?","Chuongchun, Pilatin a kuomah, “An hêkna zozai che hi i hriet naw am a nih?” a ta."
"And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.","Chun, bau khat khawmin a dawn nawh a; chuongchun, Bawrsâp chun mak a ti hleh a."
"Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.","Chun, Bawrsâpin ruoiṭhe ni chun, mi intâng pakhat an dit taphawt mipuihai chu ân suopêk hlak a."
"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.","Chun, chu lai chun, mi intâng hming inthangtak Barabba an ti chu an nei a."
"When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?","Chuongchun, an hung inkhâwm chun, Pilatin an kuomah “Tu am in- suopêk lang cheu in nuom a? Barabba am, Isu, Krista an ti chu?” a ta."
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.,Thîkna leiin ama chu an inmantir ti a hriet sih a.
"And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.","Chun, rorêlna ṭhungphaa ân ṭhung lai chun, a nuhmeiin, “Kha mi feltak chunga khan iengkhawm thaw naw rawh; vawisûn hin ama leiin mangah thil tamtak ka tuor a nih,” tiin ân chah a."
"Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le upa- haiin Barabba hnia, Isu sukhlum dingin mipuihai chu an thlêm a."
"But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.","Bawrsâp ruok chun anni chu a biek a, “Anni pahni chu a tu lem am insuopêk lang cheu in nuom a?” a ti nâwk a. Anni chun, “Barabba” an tih a."
"Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.","Pilatin an kuomah, “Isu, Krista an ti hi iengtin am thâwng ka ti leh?” a ta. An rêngin, “Krawsah inhemdêtir rawh,” an tih a."
"And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.","Chun, ama chun, “Iengdingin am ie? Ieng am a suksuol leh?” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, anni rawi chun “Krawsah inhemdêtir rawh,” tiin an khêk rak rak a."
"So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye to it.","Chuongchun, Pilatin ieng- khawm thaw thei loa buoi tieu tieu ding a nih ti a hrietin, tui a lâk a, mipui hmaa chun a kut a sâwp a, “Hi mi fel thisena hin kân thieng; nang- nîn in thaw thawin thaw ro,” a ta."
"And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.","Chun, vântlâng po po chun, “A thisen chu keini chunga le, kan nauhai chungah um raw se,” tiin an dawn a."
Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.,"Chu zoa chun Barabba chu ân suopêk tah a; Isu ruok chu a vuok a, krawsa hemde dingin a pêk tah a."
"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Prætorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.","Chu zoa chun, Bawrsâp sipaihai chun Isu chu lal inah an ṭhuoi lût a, an pâwla mi po po a kuomah an ko khâwm a."
"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.","Chuongchun, a puonhai dâm an hlîppêk a, puon sen an insiltir a."
"And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!","Chun, hling lukhum an phier a, an inkhumtir a, a kut changtieng luong an inchawitir a; a hmaah an dingṭhaṭhuon a, “Chibai, Judahai lal,” tiin nuiza siemnain an hmang a."
"And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.","Chun, chil an sâk khum a, luong chu an lâkpêk a, a lua chun an vuok a."
"And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.","Chun, nuiza siemnaa an hmang zoin, puon chu an hlîppêk a, ama puonhai chu an insiltir nâwk a; krawsa hemde dingin an ṭhuoi tah a."
"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go with them, that he might bear his cross.","Chun, an fe suok laiin Kurini khuoa mi, a hming Simon an hmuh a; chu mipa chu a kraws put dingin an man a."
"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,","Chun, Golgotha an ti hmun an hung tlung a, (chu chu, “Luru hmun,” tina a nih)"
"they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.","uoin thûr, thil kha le pawl, a dâwn dingin an pêk a, nisienla- khawm ân tem phingin a dâwn nuom ta nawh a."
"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;","Chun, krawsah an hemde zoin, aisânin a silfênhai chu an insem a."
and they sat and watched him there.,"Chun, chutaka chun an ṭhung a, an vêng a, a hêkna —"
"And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","“HI MIPA HI ISU JUDAHAI LAL A NIH,” tia ziek a lu chungah an bel a."
"Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.","Chun, ama ruol chun, suom- hmang pahni an hemde veh a, a changtieng pakhat a vawitieng pakhat."
"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,","Chun, mi inlawn taphawt chun an lu thinin, an tiel a,"
"and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.","“Nang Pathien biekin ṭhiek a, ni thuma bâwl nâwktu, insukdam rawh, Pathien Naupa i ni chun, krawsa kha hung ṭum ta la,” tiin."
"In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,","Chuong ang bawkin thiempu lalhai chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le upahai leh tielin,"
"He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.","“Mi dang hman a sukdam hlak a; ama le ama ân sukdam thei si nawh a. Israel lal a nih annâwm, tuhin krawsa inthawkin hung ṭum ta sien la, chuongchun, ama awi nâwm ei ni!"
"He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.","Pathien a awi annâwm, ama hi a nuom chun tuhin sandam raw se, ‘Pathien Naupa ka nih,’ a ti sih a,” an ta."
And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.,"Suomhmang an hemde vehai khawm chun, chuong ang bawkin an ti el veh a."
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.,"Chun, nisa indinga inthawka zânbu suong pha chenin khawvêl a hung inthim ta vawng a."
"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?","Chun, zânbu suong pha vêl chun, Isu chu râwl inringtakin, “Eli, Eli lama sabakthani” tiin a khêk suok a. (Chu chu, “Ka Pathien, ka Pathien, iengdinga i mi mâksan?” tina a nih.)"
"And some of them that stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.","Chun, a kâwla ngîr ṭhenkhathai chun chu chu an hrietin, “Hi mipa hin Elija a ko a nih,” an ta."
"And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.","Chun, an laia mi pakhat a tlân nghâl tah a, sponj a lâk a, uoin thûr ân chie sip a, hmawlah a târ a, a hang indâwntir a."
"And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.","Chun, mi danghai chun, “Um raw se, ama la dingin Elija a hung am en ei tiu,” an ta."
"And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.","Chun, Isu chu râwl inringtakin a khêk nâwk a, a thlarau ân thla tah a."
"And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;","Chun, ngai ta, Pathien biekina puonzâr chu a chung tienga in- thawkin a hnuoi tieng chenin, a lo tlêr suok tah a; chun, simkhawleihnuoi dâm ân hnîng a, lungpuihai an hung kawi a;"
and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;,thlânhai an hung inhawng a; mi inthieng in tahai taksa tamtak khawm keithoin an um tah a;
and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.,"chuonghai chu a thonâwk hnunga chun, thlâna inthawka hung suokin khaw inthienga chun an lût a, mi tamtak kuomah an inlâr tah a."
"Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.","Chun, sipai za hotu le a kuoma Isu vênga um vehai chun, simkhaw- leihnuoi inhnîng le thil umziehai chu an hmu chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a, “Hi mipa hi Pathien Naupa a ni ngei el,” an ta."
"And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:","Chun, chutaka chun nuhmei tamtak, a rawngbâwlpêk pum peia Galili rama inthawka Isu hung zuituhai chu an um a; hlatakah an thlîr a;"
"among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.","chuonghai lai chun Mari Magdalin hai, Mari, Jakob le Josef nu hai, Zebedai naupahai nuhai rawi an ṭhang a."
"And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:","Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, mi hausa, a hming Josef, Arimathaia mi a hung a, ama ngei khawm chu Isu inchûktir a ni bawk a."
"this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.","Chu mipa chu Pilat kuomah a va feh a; Isu ruong chu a hnih a. Chun, Pilatin pêk din gin thu a pêk a."
"And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,","Chuongchun, Josef chun ruong chu a lâk a, puon zai inhmi fâitakin a tuom a;"
"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.","ama thlân thar, lung a iverkuoa chun ân zâl a, thlân kawtkhâr chu lung lientakin ân del a, a fe tah a."
"And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.","Chun, chutaka chun, Mari Magdalin le Mari dang chu an um a, thlân hma zâwna chun an ṭhung a."
"Now on the morrow, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,","Chun, a zînga chun (chu chu Inringlâwk ni zo tûk a nih) thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chu Pilat kuomah an um khâwm dup a,"
"saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.","“Pu, chu hlêmtu chun, a dam lai khan ‘Ni thum chenah thonâwk ka tih,’ a ti kan hriet zing a."
"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.","Chuongchun, thlân chu ni thum ni chen vêng ṭha dingin thu pe rawh, chuong naw chun a inchûktirhai chu hungin, ama chu inru hlau an ta, vântlâng kuomah, ‘Mithi laia in- thawkin a thonâwk ta a nih,’ ti rawi an tih; chuongchun, hlêmna nuhnung lem chu a hmasa nêk khan ṭha naw nâwk zuol a tih,” an ta."
"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it as sure as ye can.","Pilatin an kuomah, “Vêngtu sipaihai in nei annâwm, fe unla in thei ang angin invêngṭhattir ta unla,” a ta."
"So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.","Chuongchun, vêngtu sipaihai leh an feh a, thlân chu an invêng ṭhattir a, lung chu an inchik a."
"Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.","Chun, Châwlni zo, ni saria ni hmasatak dinga khuo a var tâwmin, Mari Magdalin le Mari dang chu thlân en dingin an feh a."
"And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.","Chun, ngai ta, simkhawleihnuoi nasatakin a hung inhnîng a, Lalpa vântirko vâna inthawkin a hung ṭum a, lung chu a hung inhlum a, a chungah a ṭhung tah a."
"His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:","A hmêl umzie chu kâwlinlep ang a na, a silfên chu vûr angin a vâr a."
"and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.","Ama an ṭi leiin vêngtuhai chu an inthin a, mithi ang elin an hung um tah a."
"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.","Chun, vântirko chun nuhmeihai chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Nangni chu ṭi naw ro! Isu an hemde kha in zawng ti ka hriet!"
"He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.",Hitaka hin a um ta nawh; a hril ang ngeiin a thonâwk ta a nih. A zâlna hi hung en hman ta u.
"And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.","Chun, fe vak unla, a inchûktirhai kuomah, ‘Mithi laia inthawkin a thonâwk ta a nih, ngai ta u, Galili ramah in hmaah a fe, chutaka chun ama chu hmûng in tih,’ tiin hril ro. Ngai ta u, ka hril ta cheu hi,” a ta."
"And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.","Chun, ṭi le lâwm bêk bêk pumin thlâna inthawk chun an fe vat vat a, a închûktirhai hril dingin an tlân tah a."
"And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.","Chun, ngai ta, Isûn anni chu ân tuokpui a, “Chibai” a ti tâwl a. Chuongchun, anni chun a ke chu an va chel a, chibai an bûk a."
"Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah “Ṭi naw ro, fe unla, Galili rama fe dingin ka unauhai va hril ro; chutaka chun mi hmûng an tih,” a ta."
"Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.","Chun, an va fe lai chun vêngtu sipai ṭhenkhat chu khawpuiah an va lût a, thil umzie po po chu thiempu lalhai kuomah an va hril a."
"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,","Chun, upahai leh an inkhâwma an inrâwn zoin sipaihai kuoma chun tangka tamtak an pêk a,"
"saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.","“ ‘Zânah kan in kârin a închûk- tirhai chu an hung a, ama an inrûk a nih,’ ti ro."
"And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.","Chun, Bawrsâpin chu chu a hriet chun ama chu thlêm kan ta, lunginhâng loin siem kan ti cheu,” an ta."
"So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continueth until this day.","Chuongchun, tangka chu an lâk a, an iti ang pei chun an ti tah a; chuongchun, tu chen hin chu thu chu Judahai laiah an la hril ta pei a nih."
"But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktir sâwm le pakhat hai chu Galili ramah, Isûn tlâng a iruot pêka chun an feh a."
"And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.","Chun, ama an hmu chun chibai an bûk a, ṭhenkhat ruok chun an ringhlah a."
"And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.","Chuongchun Isu chu an kuomah a hung a, anni rawi chu a biek a, “Hnuoi le vâna thuneina po po ka kuomah pêk a ni tah."
"Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:","“Chuongchun, fe unla, hnam tina mi inchûktir dâmin siem unla, Pa le, Naupa le, Thlarau Inthieng hming chun baptist unla;"
"teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.","thu ka ipêk po po cheu pawm dingin inchûktir ro. Chun, ngai ta u, kei kumkhuoin khawvêl tâwp chen khawmin in kuomah um pei ka tih,” a ta."
"And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa, saying,","Chuong lai chun Baptistu Johan chu, Judai thlalêrah thuhrilin a hung a,"
Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.,"“Sim ro, vân ram chu a hnai tah,” tiin."
"For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.","Ama chu a nih, zâwlnei Isaiin, “Thlalêra mi khêk rawl chun, ‘Lalpa lamlien buotsai unla, A lampuihai suktlûn ro,’ a tih,” tia a hril kha."
"Now John himself had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.","Chun, Johan chun sanghâwngsei hmul puon a sil a, a kâwng chu savun kâwngkhiin ân khit a; a bu chu khâuṭhikṭhi le ram khuoizu a nih."
"Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about the Jordan;","Chu lai chun Jerusalema mi dâm, Juda rama mi po po dâm, Jordan vadung vêla mi po po an suok a, a kuom tieng an feh a;"
"and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.",an suolhai thupha chawiin Jordan vadungah ama kuomah Baptisma an chang tâwl a.
"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?","Nisienlakhawm, Pharisaihai le Saddukaihai tamtak a baptisma chang dinga hung a hmu phingleh, an kuomah, “Rûl thlahai, lungsen hung tlung ding hi tlânsan dingin tuin am a kâwk cheu a?"
Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:,"Chuongchun, sim hming input tlâkin ra ro."
"and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.","“ ‘Abraham ei thlatu a nih annawm,’ tiin inngaituo naw ro; Pathienin hieng lunghai hi Abraham thlahai dingin ân ngirtir thei ti ka hril cheu hi."
"And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.","Tuta inthawk el khawmin thing bul tinah hreipui an sie tah; chuong- chun, thing tin ra ṭhaa ra naw phawt chu an phûr a, meiah an pei hlak."
"I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:","Kei chun chu simna dingin tuiin ka baptis hlak cheu a; nisienla- khawm, ka hnunga hung ding chu keia nêkin a ropui lem a, a kekawk chawi tlâk khawm ka ni nawh.

"whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.","A kutin a leipup a chawi a, a hrizâwl zâp fai hieu a ta, a pangah a bû hlûng a ta, a si ruok chu mei rêm thei loin raw hmang a tih,” a ta."
"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.",Chu lai chun a kuoma baptisma chang dingin Isu Galili rama in- thawkin Jordan vadungah Johan kuomah a hung a.
"But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?","Johan ruok chun, “I mi baptis ka ṭûl lem sih a, ka kuomah i hung lem a ni maw?” tiin khap a tum a."
"But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffereth him.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a kuom- ah, “Tuhin remti hrâm rawh, hieng anga felna po po sukkim hi ei ta dingin a mawi a nih,” tiin a dawn a. Chuongchun, rem a ti tah a."
"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;","Chun, Isu baptisma a chang phingleh, tuia inthawk chun a suok nghâl tah a; chun, ngai ta, a ta dingin vân a hung inhawng a, Pathien Thlarau chu vaṭhu anga hung ṭuma a chunga hung fu a hmuh a."

Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.,Chu zoa chun Isu chu Diebol thlêma um dingin thlalêrah Thlarau ṭhuoi lûtin a um tah a.
"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.","Chun, ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli a nghei hnungin a phîng a hung ṭâm tah a."
"And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.","Chun, thlêmtu chu a hung a, a kuomah, “Pathien Naupa i ni chun, hieng lunghai hi beia inchang dingin thu pe rawh,” a ta."
"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “Mi- hriem hi bei chauin hring naw ni hai a, Pathien baua thu tin suokin hring lem an tih,” ti ziek a nih, tiin a dawn a."
"Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,","Chu zoa chun diebol chun khaw inthienga chun a ṭhuoi lût a, Pathien biekin sîp zuma chun a sieh a;"
"and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.","Chun, a kuomah, “Pathien Nau- pa i ni chun tla thla rawh; ‘I chungchânga chu a vântirkohai chu thu pêng a ta, An kutin dawm an ti cheh a, Chuong naw chun I kein lung sui hlau rawi i tih,’ ti ziek a ni si a,” a ta."
"Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.","Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Lalpa i Pathien fie naw,’ ti ziek a ni ve bawk a nih,” a ta."
"Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;","Chun, diebol chun tlâng insâng- takah a ṭhuoi nâwk a, khawvêl ram po po le a ropuina chu ân entir a."

"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.","Chu phingleh Isûn, “Setan, fe hmang dai rawh; ‘Lalpa i Pathien chibai bûk la, ama rawng chau bâwl rawh,’ ti ziek a nih,” a ta."
"Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.","Chu hnunga chun diebol chun a zâmsan tah a. Chun, ngai ta, vântir- kohaiin a rawng an bâwlpêk tah a."
"Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;","Chun, Johan an man ti Isûn a hriet phingleh Galili ramah a fe ta dai a;"
"and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:","chun, Nazareth a mâksan a, Kapernaumah a um ta zing a, chu chu Zebulun le Naphtali biela dil panga um a nih:"
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,","zâwlnei Isai baua,"
"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,","“Dîl tienga Jordan râlah, Zebulun le Naphtali ram, Jentailhai Galili;"
"The people that sat in darkness Saw a great light, And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, To them did light spring up.","Inthim hnuoia ṭhunghai chun var nasatak an hmuh a, Thina hmun le a hlima ṭhunghai chunga chun, Var a hung suok tah a,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
"From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.","Chu chena inthawk chu Isûn, “Sim ro, vân ram chu a hnai tah,” tiin a hril phut tah a."
"And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.","Chun, Galili dil panga a lêng malamin, unau pahni, Simon (Peter an ti chu) a unau Andri leh dila chun lên dêngin a hmuh a; nga mantu an ni hrim a."
"And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Mi zui ro, chuongchun, mihriem mantuin siem ka ti cheu,” a ta."
"And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.",Lênhai chu mâksanin an zui nghâl tah a.
"And going on from thence he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.","Chutaka inthawk chun a fe pei a, unau dang pahni, Zebedai naupa Jakob le a unau Johan chu, an pa Zebedai kuoma lawngah an lênhai siemṭhain a hmuh a, anni chu a ko tah a."
"And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him.","Chuongchun, lawng le an pa chu an mâksan a, an zui nghâl tah a."
"And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.","Chun, Isûn an inkhawmna inhaia inchûktirin, ram Chanchin Ṭha chu hrilin mihai laia natna tinrêng le hrât nawna tinrêng suk- damin Galili ram po po a fang pei a."
"And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.","Chun, Suria ram po poah a chanchin ân thang tah a; chuong- chun, mi damnaw po po, damnawna le natna tinrênga nahai, khawhri imanhai, hringawl invawihai, zeng- hai a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a, a lo sukdam tâwl a."
And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judæa and from beyond the Jordan.,"Galili rama inthawk dâm, Dekapoli khuoa inthawk dâm, Jeru- salema inthawk dâm, Judai rama inthawk dâmin le Jordan râla inthawk dâm chun mipui nasatakin ama an zui bawk a."
"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:","Chuongchun, mipuihai chu a hmuin tlângah a lâwn a; chun, a ṭhung a, a inchûktirhai a kuomah an hung a;"

"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","Chuongchun, tukhawm hieng thupêk laia pakhat, a chîntak khawm bawsea, chuonga thaw ve dinga mihai inchûktir taphawt chu, vân rama chun mi chîn tak tîng an tih; ami- ruokchu, tukhawm zâwma inchûktir taphawt chu, vân rama chun mi lien tîng an tih."

"It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:","“Chun, ‘Tukhawm nuhmei ma chun inmâkna lekha a kuomah pe raw se,’ an ti bawk a."
"but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.","Kei ruok chun, tukhawm tlangvâl dit lei ni loa mâni nuhmei ma taphawt chun, ama chu ân uirettir a nih; tukhawm mâk hnung chu nei taphawt chu a uire a nih ti ka hril cheu hi."

"But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one.","‘A nih,’ in ti chu ‘a nih,’ ni sienla, ‘A ni nawh’ in ti chu ‘a ni nawh’ ni el raw se, chuonghai bâk chu suola inthawka suok a nih."

that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.,"chuongchun, i Pa a rûka hmutu che chun thung a ti che."
"And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

"And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.","Suol dinga thlêmnaa chun mi ṭhuoi lût naw la, Mi suol laka chu mi sandam lem rawh, tiin."
"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","“Mi an bawsiethai in ngaidam chun, in Pa vâna mîn ngaidam vêng a ti cheu."
"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","Nisienlakhawm, mihai in ngai- dam si naw chun, in Pain in baw- sietnahai ngaidam bîk naw ni."
"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.","“Bu in nghei pha khawmin, mi vervêkhai angin ngui hmêl put naw ro; anni chun mi mithmua bungheia an inlang theina dingin an hmêl an sukpawr hlak sih a.

"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;","Nang ruok chun bu i nghei pha i lu sahriek nâl la, i hmai phi rawh;"
"that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall recompense thee.","chuongchun, i Pa arûka um mithmua chau naw chun, mihriem mithmuah bungheiin inlang naw ti ni; chuongchun, i Pa arûka hmutu che chun thung a ti che."
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal:","“Hnuoia hângthim le tuiêkin a fâk sietnaah, inruhaiin an verpawpa an inrûknaa hin in ta dingin rohai inkhâwl naw ro."
"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:","Vânah, hângthim le tuiêkin a fâk siet nawnaah, inruhaiin an ver- pawpa an inrûk nawnaa chun, in ta dingin rohai siekhâwl lem ro;"
"for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.",i ro umna taphawtah i lungril khawm a um ding a ni sih a.
"The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.",“Taksa khâwnvar chu mit hi a nih; i mit a var chun i taksa a rêngin var suok a tih.
"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness!","I mit a se ruok chun i taksa a rêngin inthim vawng a tih. Chuong- chun, i sûnga var chu inthim ni sien chu, inthim chu a va nasa awm ngei de!"
"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","“Tukhawmin hotu pahni rawng bâwl kawp thei naw ni hai; pakhat theidain pakhat dit an tih, annawleh, pakhat ṭanin pakhat hmusit an tih.

"Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment?","“Chuleichun, ka hril cheu hi, ‘Ieng am dâwnin ieng am fa tâng ka ta?’ tiin, in hringna thu le, ‘Ieng am silin bil ka ta aw?’ tiin, in taksa thu lungkham naw ro.

"Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they?","“Chunglêng vatehai hi en ta u; bu an tu nawh a, an sîk bawk nawh a; bu ina khawm an sêklût bawk nawh, nisienlakhawm, in Pa vâna mi chun a châwm sih a.

And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life?,"Chun, nangni lai tuin am lung- kham leiin mâni dung tieng tawng khata suksâng chuong thei cheu?"
"And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:","Chun, silfên thuah iengdinga in lungkham am a na? Ram tûktinpâr inṭhangzie hi ṭha takin ngaituo ro; sin an thaw nawh, pat khawm an kher bawk nawh;"

"But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?","Chuongchun, ram hlohna, vawi- sûn anga hringa, a zînga thuka ti nâwk el ding hman Pathienin chuong ang lâwma a chei chun, aw! nangni ringna tlâwmhai, silfên a pêk lem hman hman ding cheu a ni naw am a nih?"

"But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.","A ram le a felna chu zawng hmasa lem ro; chuongchun, chuong po po chu a pêk sa ding cheu a nih."
Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.,"Chuongchun, a zînga dingin lungkham naw ro, a zîng chun ama ding chu a lungkham fâwm ding a ni sih a. Ni khat dingin ni khat rimsik a hun a nih."
"Judge not, that ye be not judged.","“Sawisêl naw ro, sawisêla in um nawna dingin."
"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you.","In sawisêl ang bawkin sawisêlin um in tih, in inkhina ngai bawka inkhipêk ni nâwk in tih."
"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","Chun, iengdinga mâni mita tlung- pûm um ngaituo si loa; i unau mita hmawl hlek um chu i hmu am a na?"
"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?","Iengtin am i unau kuomah, ‘I mita hmawl hlek kha mîn lâk dawktir rawh,’ ti thei i ta? Ngai ta, nanga mit ngeiah tlungpûm chu a um zing sih a."

"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend you.",“Ui kuoma dâm thil inthieng chu pe naw ro; vawk hmaa dâm in lung- hlu pei bawk naw ro; chîl se hlau rawi an ta; ngha lêtin phirthlêr rawi an ti cheu.”

"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?","Chuongchun, nangni mi suol hmanin in nauhai thil ṭha pêk nachang in hriet chun, in Pa vâna mi chun a hnituhai chu thil ṭha a pêk lem hman hman naw ding am a nih?"

Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.,Chuong ang bawkin thing ṭha taphawt chu a ra ṭha hlak; thing ṭha naw ruok chu a ra se hlak.
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","Thing ṭha a ra se thei nawh a, thing ṭha naw hlak a ra ṭha thei bawk nawh."
"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.","Thing tin a ra ṭha naw chu an phûr a, meiah an pei hlak."
Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.,"Chuleiin, anni chu an raah hrieng in tih."
"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.","“ ‘Lalpa, Lalpa,’ a mi ti nazawng chu vân ramah lût naw ni hai, ka Pa vâna mi dit zâwng thawtuhai ruok chu lût an tih."

"Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock:","“Chuongchun, mi tin hieng ka thu hrea zâwm taphawt chu, mi var lungpui chunga in bâwltu leh hrilkhi ding a nih."
"and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.","Ruo dâm a hung sûr a, tui dâm a hung lien a, thli dâm a hung hrâng a, chu in chu a hung nam sawk sawk a; nisienlakhawm, a chim nawh a; lungpui chunga rem tlat a ni leiin."
"And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:","Chun, mi tin hieng ka thu hrea zâwm naw taphawt chu mi invêt phaiphin chung ela in bâwltu leh hrilkhi ding a nih."
"and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof.","Ruo dâm a hung sûr a; tui dâm a hung lien a, thli dâm a hung hrâng a, chu in chu a hung nam sawk sawk a; a chim tah a; a chim chu nasatak a nih,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:","Chun, Isûn chuong thil chu a hril zo phingleh, mipuihaiin a thu inchûk tir chu mak an ti hleh a;"
"for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.","Dân inchûktirtuhai ang loa, thuneina neitaka anni ân chûktir leiin."
"And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.",Tlânga inthawka a hung ṭumin mipui nasatakin ama an zui tah a.
"And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","Chun, ngai ta, a kuomah phâr a hung a, “Lalpa, i nuom chun i mi sukthieng thei,” tiin chibai a bûk a."
"And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed.","Isûn a hang ban a, a them a, “Ka nuom ie, lo inthieng ta rawh,” a ta, kâr loin a phâr chu a lo inthieng nghâl tah a."
"And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Tu- khawm hril lo dingin fîmkhur rawh aw; amiruokchu, thiempu kuomah vân entir la, Mosiein pêk dinga a ruothai kha inhlân rawh, an hriet felna dingin,” a ta."
"And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,","Chun, Kapernaum a lûtin, a kuomah sipai za hotu a hung a,"
"and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.","“Lalpa, ka naupang a zeng a, inah a zâl zing a, nasataka suknatin a um a nih,” tiin a ngên a."
"And he saith unto him, I will come and heal him.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Hung ka ta, sukdam ka tih,” a ta."
"And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.","Sipai za hotu chun, “Lalpa, ka in sûng i lûtna tlâk a ni nawh ie; thu chau hril la ka naupang dam el a tih."
"For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.","Kei khawm mi thua um ka na, ka hnuoiah sipaihai an um a; chu mipa kha mipa chu, ‘Fe rawh,’ ka ti leh a fe hlak; mi dang kuoma khawm, ‘Hung rawh,’ ka ti leh a hung hlak, ka suok kuoma khawm, ‘Ahi thaw rawh,’ ka ti leh a thaw hlak,” tiin a dawn a."
"And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.","Isûn chuong thu chu a hrietin mak a ti hleh a, ama zuituhai kuoma chun, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu, Israel- hai lai khawm hieng ang lâwma ringna nasa hi ka hmu nawh."
"And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:","Ka hril cheu hi, sak le thlanga inthawkin mi tamtak hung an ta, vân rama chun Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai kuomah ṭhung an ta;"
but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"ram nauhai ruok chu tuol inthima chun hnawt dawkin um an ta; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih,” a ta."
"And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And the servant was healed in that hour.","Chun, Isûn sipai za hotu kuoma chun, “Fe ta rawh, i ring angin i chungah hung tlung raw se,” a ta. Chuongchun, naupang chu chu dâra chun a lo dam tah a."
"And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.","Chun, Isu chu Peter ina a lûtin, a nuhmei nu chu khawsika zâlin a hmuh a."
"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him.","Chuongchun, a kut chu a them pêk a, a khawsik chu a bo tah a, chun, a tho a, a rawng a bâwlpêk tah a."
"And when even was come, they brought unto him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick:","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, a kuomah khawhri imanhai tamtak an hung ṭhuoi a; thuin khawhrihai chu a hnawt dawk a, damnaw po po chu a sukdam bawk a:"
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases.","zâwlnei Isaiin, “Ama ngeiin ei hrâtnawnahai a lâk a, ei natnahai a phur a,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
"Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.","Chun, Isûn, mipui nasatak a vêla a hmuin râl khingtienga fe dingin thu a pêk a."
"And there came a scribe, and said unto him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.","Chun, Dân Inchûktirtu pakhat a hung a, a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i fena taphawtah zui ka ti che,” a ta."
"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","Isûn a kuomah, “Sihalhaiin kuo an nei a, chunglêng vatehai khawmin bu an nei a, Mihriem Naupa ruok hin chu a lu innghatna a nei nawh,” a ta."
"And another of the disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.","Chun, inchûktirhai laia mi dangin a kuomah, “Lalpa, fea ka pa hung vui hmasa phawt dingin mi phal rawh,” a ta."
"But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a kuomah, “Mi zui rawh, mithiin anni mithi chu vui raw se,” a ta."
"And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.","Chun, lawngah a chuong a, a inchûktirhai chun an zui a."
"And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.","Chun, ngai ta, dila chun thlipui nasatak a hung hrâng a, chuongchun, tuifâwn chun lawng chu a chîm pup pup el a; ama ruok chu a in a."
"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish.","A kuomah an hung a, an keitho a, “Lalpa, mi sanhim rawh, kan bohmang ding annâwm hi,” an ta."
"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ringna tlâwmhai, iengdinga in ṭi?” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho a, thli le dîl chu a hal a, chun, a hung re ta duok el a."
"And the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?","Mihai chun mak an ti hle a, “Hi mipa hi mi ieng am a na, thli le dîl chen khawma a thu an awi hi?” an ta."
"And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.","Chun, râl khingtieng Gadarin mihai ram chu a tlungin, khawhri iman pahni, thlâna inthawka hung suokin, an hung intuokpui a; an hrâng bêk a; chuongchun, chu lampuia chun tukhawm an fe thei nawh a."
"And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?","Chun, ngai ta, anni chun, “Pathien Naupa, nang le keini ieng am ei inzâwlna? A hun tlung hmain a mi sawisa dinga hitaka hung am i nih?” tiin an khêk a."
Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding.,"Chun, an kâwla inthawka hla reia chun vawk ruol tamtak an tlah a."
"And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.","Khawhrihai chun, “I mi hnawt dawk chun vawk ruol sûngahai sawn mîn fetir rawh,” tiin a kuomah an ngên a."
"And he said unto them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Fe ta ro am,” a ta. Chuongchun, an hung suok a, vawkhai sûnga chun an va lût a; chun, ngai ta, vawk ruol po po chu râwlah an tlân thla hum hum el a; dîlah an tla lût a, tuia chun an tla hlum tah a."
"And they that fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons.","Chun, a vâituhai chu an tlân a, khuoa chun an feh a, iengkim an hril tah a, khawhri iman chunga thil tlunghai khawm chu."
"And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart from their borders.","Chun, ngai ta, akhuoin Isu tuok dingin an hung suok a; chun ama an hmu phingleh an rama inthawka suok dingin an ngên tah a."
"And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.","Chun, Isu lawngah a chuong a,dîl chu a râlkai a, a umna khuo chu a tlung a."
"And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.","Chun, ngai ta, zeng pakhat khuma zâl pumin a kuomah an hung zâwn a.

"And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.","Chun, ngai ta, Dân Inchûktirtu ṭhenkhathai chun an lungrilin, “Hi mipa hin Pathien a hrilsiet a ni tie,” an ta."
"And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?","Isûn an ngaituohai chu a lo hriet a, “Iengdinga in lungrila suol in ngaituo am a na?"
"For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?","‘I suolhai ngaidam a ni tah,’ ti le, ‘Tho la kein fe rawh,’ ti hi a ieng am ti a awl lem a?"
"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, khawvêlah Mihriem Naupa hin suol ngaidam theina a nei ti in hrietna dingin,” a ta, (zeng kuoma chun), “Tho la, i khum la la, i inah fe rawh,” a ta."
"And he arose, and departed to his house.","Chun, a tho a, a inah a fe tah a."
"But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men.","Chun, mipuihai chun chu chu an hmuin an ṭi a, mihriemhai kuoma chuong ang thuneina petu Pathien chu an inpâk a."
"And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.","Chun, Isu chutaka inthawkin a fe pei a, sie chawina hmuna ṭhung mi pakhat, a hming Matthai, a hmuh a; a kuomah, “Mi hung zui rawh,” a ta.

"And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.","Chun, ina chun thlaithlêng a awt laiin, ngai ta, siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai tamtak an hung a, Isu le a inchûktirhai chu an awtpui tâwl a."
"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners?","Pharisaihai chun chu chu an hmuin, a inchûktirhai kuomah, “Ieng- dinga in inchûktirtuin siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai lai a fâk am a na?” an ta."

"But go ye and learn what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.","Chuongchun, ‘Inthâwina dit loin lunginsietna ka dit ie,’ ti hi, fe unla, a umzie vân chûk ro; mi fel takhai indawn dinga hung ka ni nawh a, mi suolhai lem indawn dinga hung ka nih in sawnnaw,” a ta."
"Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?","Chu lai chun, Johan inchûktir- hai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Iengdinga keini le Pharisaihai hin bu kan nghei rawp a, i inchûktirhai hlak hin an nghei si nawh a?” an ta."
"And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.","Isûn an kuomah, “Mo ṭhuoi- tuhai kuoma a pasal ding chu a um sûng phawt chun mo ṭhuoituhaiin an sûn thei am a nih?

"And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made.","Chun, tukhawmin puon hlui puon la rin mar lo hlekin an phâwk ngai nawh; a phâwk pingna ding chun puon chu keithlêr lem a ta, a tlêr nasa lem ding a ni sih a."
"Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved.","Tukhawmin uoin thar savun uoin peng hluiah an thun ngai nawh; chuong naw chun savun penghai chu a puok khawi a, uoin chu ân buoh a, savun penghai chu a se hlak; uoin thar chu savun peng tharhaiah an thun lem hlak a nih; chuongchun, ṭhatakin a um rêl hlak,” a ta."
"While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.","Chuong thu chu an kuoma a hril lai takin, ngai ta,hotu pakhat a hung a, chibai a bûk a, “Ka naunu tu el khan a thih a; nisienlakhawm, hung la, a chungah kut innghat la dam nâwk a tih,” a ta."
"And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.","Chuongchun, Isu a tho a, a zui tah a, a inchûktirhai khawmin an zui veh a."
"And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:","Chun, ngai ta, nuhmei pakhat, kum sâwmpahni thipûta damnaw, a hnungah a hung a, a puon hmawr a them a,"
"for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.","“A puon hmawr chau khawm them lang sukdamin um el ka tih,” a ti lungril a na."
"But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.","Chun, Isu a nghah a, ama chu a hmuh a, “Ka naunu, lungmuongtakin um rawh, i ringna hi i dampui a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, nuhmei chu chu dâr chena chun a hung dam tah a."
"And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,","Chun, Isu hotu inah a lût a, theihle mûthai le mipui inri mur mur a va hmu chun,"
"he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.","“Suok ro, naupang chu a thi nawh, a in a ni lem in sawnnaw,” a ta. Anni chun ama chu an nuisan tah a."
"But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.","Nisienlakhawm, mipui chu a hnawt suok hnung chun a lût a, a kutah a chel a, naupang chu a hung tho tah a."
And the fame hereof went forth into all that land.,"Chu chena inthawk chun, chuong ram po poa chun chu chanchin chu ân thang suok tah a."
"And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David.","Chun, Isu chutaka inthawkin a fe pei a, mitdel pahniin, “David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tia khêkin an zui a."
"And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.","Chun, inah a lût chun, mitdel- hai chu a kuomah an hung a; chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Hi hi thaw thei dingin in mi ring am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Ring e, Lalpa” an ta."
"Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you.","Ama chun an mit a them a, “In ring angin in chungah tlung raw se,” a ta."
"And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.","Chuongchun, an mit chu a hung var tah a. Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tukhawm ihriet naw dingin fimkhur ro,” a ti tlat a."
"But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chu an suok a, chu ram po poa chun a chanchin an sukthang tah a."
"And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.","Chun, an suok lai takin, ngai ta, khawhri iman ṭawng thei naw pakhat a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
"And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.","Chun, khawhri chu a hnawt dawk phingleh ṭawng thei naw chu a hung ṭawng tah a. Mipuihai chun mak an ti hleh a, “Israelhai lai khawm hieng ang hi hmu a ni ngai nawh,” an ta."
"But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.","Pharisaihai ruok chun, “Khaw- hri lal leiin a nih, khawhrihai a hnawt dawk hlak chu,” an ta."
"And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.","Chun, Isûn an inkhâwmna in- haia inchûktirin, Ram Chanchin Ṭha chu hrilin, damnawna tinrêng le, nat- na tinrênghai sukdamin khaw lien le khaw chînhai po po a fang pei a."
"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chu a hmuin, vêngtu nei naw berâmhai anga rinum le indara an um leiin, a lunginsiet ta bêk bêk el a."
"Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.","Chuongchun, a inchûktirhai kuoma chun, “Bu sîk ding a tam hle sih a; nisienlakhawm, a sinthawtuhai an tlâwm."
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.","Chuleiin, a bu sîk dinga sin- thawtu dinghai tir dingin bu Neitupa kuoma chun ngên ro,” a ta."
