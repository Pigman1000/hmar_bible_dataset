"Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),","Paula, tirko (mihriemhai tir suok ni loa, mihriemhai zârah ni bawk loa, Isu Krista le mithi laia inthawka a keithotu, Pa Pathien zâra tirko ni lem) le,"
"and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:","ka kuoma unau um po pohai chun, Galati rama kohranhai kuomah:"
"Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,",Pa Pathien le ei Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawkin lungin- sietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se:
"who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:","ama chun ei Pathien le ei Pa remtizâwngin tulai khawvêl suoltaka a mi san suok theina dingin, ei suolhai aiin ama ân pe tah a;"
to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.,Pathien kuoma chun ropuina chatuonin um raw se. Amen.
I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;,Krista lunginsietna zâra a kotu cheu kha chuong ang thuta chanchin ṭha dang tienga in kai san hi a mak ka ti a nih.
"which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.","Chu chu Chanchin Ṭha a ni ve si nawh a; nangni sukbuoiin, Krista Chanchin Ṭha suk danglam nuom tuhai amanih an um el a nih."
"But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.","Nisienlakhawm, keiniin amanih, vâna inthawka hung ṭum vântirko khawmin amanih, Chanchin Ṭha kan ihril cheu ti lo kha chu chanchin ṭha dang hrim hrim lo hril sien la cheu ṭawngsephurin um raw se."
"As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.","Inhmaa kan hril ang khan tuhin ka hril nâwk ding a nih, “Chanchin Ṭha in ipawm naw kha chu, chanchin ṭha dang tûkhawmin hril sien la cheu, ṭawngsephurin um raw se.”"
"For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.","Anleh, tuhin mihriem suklâwm tum am ka ni, Pathien suklâwm? Annawleh, mihriem laia tlâktlum tum ringawt am ka nih? Lo ni lang chu Krista suok ni naw ningah."
"For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.","Chuongchun, unauhai, ka Chanchin Ṭha hril kha mihriem tieng thu a ni nawh ti kân hriettir cheu."
"For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.","Mihriem kuoma inthawka hmu ka ni bawk nawh a, mi mîn chûktir ka ni bawk nawh. Isu Krista inlârna leia hmu ka ni lem sih a."
"For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:","Judahai sakhuo biek dâna chun inhmaa ka um dân chu in hriet ta sih a, khânga Pathien kohranhai nasa- taka suknawmnain ka sukbuoi hlak kha;"
"and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.","chun, ka thlatuhai thurosie chunga ṭhahnem ka ngai nasa bîk leiin, Judahai sakhaw biek dân kawnga chun ka chihai laia ka ruolpui tamtakhai ka lekhêl tah a."
"But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,","Chun, ka nu phîngsûnga inthawka a mi suktumtu le, a lungin- sietna leia a mi kotu Pathien chun lungnitaka,"
"to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:","Jentailhai laia Chanchin Ṭha ka hril theina dingin, a Naupa chu keimaa ân lârtir lai khan, tisa le thisen kân rawnpui nawh a."
neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.,"Tirko ka ni hmaa tirko lo ni tahai kuomah Jerusalemah hang fe chuong loin, Arabia ramah ka fe hmang nghâl ta lem a. Chun, Damaskaah ka kîr nâwk tah a."
"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.","Chun, kum thum ân vawi hnungin Kipha kan dingin Jerusa- lemah ka hang feh a, a kuomah ni sâwmpanga ka châm a."
"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.","Tirko danghai ruok chu, Lalpa unau Jakob chau naw chu, tûkhawm ka hmu nawh a."
"Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.","(Ngai hman ta u, in kuoma thu ka ziekhai hi Pathien mithmua khawm kân khêl nawh)."
Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.,Chu hnunga chun Suria le Kiliki ramahai ka hung tah a.
And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ:,"Nisienlakhawm, Judai ram kohran Kristaa umhai hmêlhriet ka la ni naw ta rawp a,"
"but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;","“Inhmaa a mi suknawmnatu khan, inhmaa ringna thu a suk- khawhlo hlak kha tuhin a hril ta lem a nih,” ti mi hril chau an hriet a."
and they glorified God in me.,"Chun, keia leiin Pathien an chawimawi tah a."
"Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.","Chun, kum sâwmpali ân vawi hnungin, Tita khawm chu ṭhuoi vein, Barnaba ruolin Jerusalemah ka hang fe nâwk a."
"And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.","Chun, hriettirna leiin ka hang feh a, Jentailhai laia Chanchin Ṭha tlâng ka însampui hlak hi anni ka hang hril a; nisienlakhawm mi lien deuhai chu a tumin ka hril a, chuong naw chun a thlâwnin tlân hlau rawi ka tih; annawleh, tlân thlâwn tah ni rawi ka tih."
"But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:","Nisienlakhawm, Tita ka kuoma um khawm chu, Grik mi ni sien khawm ser tan lui pêkin a um ta nawh a;"
"and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:","unau tehlêm, inrûka an iṭhuoi lûthaiin tan luipêk ding tihai sien khawm; chuonghai chun suoka an mi sie theina dingin Krista Isua chun zalênna kan nei hi enthlit dingin inrûkin an lût a."
"to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.","Nisienlakhawm, Chanchin Ṭha thutak chu in kuoma a um zing theina dingin, dârkâr khat khawm intuklûtin an thu ka zâwm nawh a."
"But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)—they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:","Chun, mi lien deua an iruothai lai chun, (ieng ang mi khawm ni sien la ka ta dingin a dang chuong nawh, Pathienin tûkhawm a thlier bîk nawh a) mi lien deua an iruothai chun iengkhawm an mi belsa chuong si nawh a;"
"but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision","chuong nêk hmanin Sertanhai Chanchin Ṭha Peter kuoma inkawl- tira a um angin, Sertannawhai Chanchin Ṭha ka kuomah inkawl- tirin a um ti an hriet a."
(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);,"(Sertanhai tirko ni dinga Peter ta dinga thaw pêktu ngei chun, Jentailhai tirko ni dingin ka ta ding khawma a mi thaw pêk sih a.)"
"and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;","Lunginsietna a mi pêk chu an hrietin, Jakob hai, Kipha hai, Johan hai, bana an iruothai chun, keini Jentailhai laia fe ding le, anni po sertanhai kuoma fe dingin kei le Barnaba chu inpâwlna kut chang- tieng an mi pêk ta lem hman a."
only they would that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.,"Pasiehai kan ihriet chau an nuom, chu tak chu thaw ka tum tlat hrim hlak chu a nih."
"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.","Chun, Kipha chu Antiokeia a hung laiin demumtaka a um leiin, a hmai san ngeiah ka kal a."
"For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.","Mi tuhai amanih Jakob kuoma inthawka an hung hma chun, ama chun Jentailhai lai bu a fâk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, an hung tlung phingleh Sertan mihai chu a ṭi leiin ṭhang nâwk ta loin, ân suktum ta sih a."
And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.,"Juda danghai khawm an vervêk tâwl tah a; chuongchun, Barnaba meu khawm an vervêkna ṭhuoi hmangin a um ta hiel a."
"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?","Nisienlakhawm, Chanchin Ṭha thutak angin an um fel nawh ti ka hrietin, Kipha kuomah, an rênga hmaah, “Nang Juda mi ni siin, Juda anga um loin Jentail angin i um a. Iengtiziea Jentailhai chu Judahai anga în umluitir hlak am a na?” ka tih a."
"We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",Keini chu Jentail mi suolhai ni loin Juda mi hrima pieng kan na;
"yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.","nisienlakhawm, Dân thilthaw leiin mi thiem changin a um nawh a, Isu Krista ring lei chauin thiem changin a um lem ti kan hriet sih a. Keini khawmin Dân thilthaw lei ni loin, Krista awina leia thiem changa kan um theina dingin, Krista Isu chu kan awi a nih; Dân thilthaw leiin mihriem hrim hrim thiem changin um si naw ni hai a."
"But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.","Kristaa thiem changa um kan tumnaa hin, keini ngei khawm mi suola ngai kan lo ni lem hlau chun, anleh, Krista chu suol sin thawtu ni el a ti?"
"For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.","Teu lo e, ka thil ṭhiekhai kha ka bâwl nâwk si chun, bawsetu ka nizie kân hriettir el ning a tih."
"For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.",Pathien tieng kawnga ka hung hring theina dingin kei chu Dân leiin Dân tieng kawngah ka thi ta sih a.
"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me: and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.","Krista kuomah hemdein ka um tah. Nisienlakhawm, ka hring a nih, kei ruok chu ka ni ta nawh a, Krista chu keimaah a hring lem a nih; chun, tuta tisaa ka hring hi ringnaa hring ka nih, Pathien Naupa, mi lunginsiettu, ka aia inpetu ringnaa chun."
"I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.",Pathien lunginsietna chu ka bawhmang nawh. Dân leia felna a um si chun Krista chu a thlâwnin a thi nîng a tih.
"O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?","Aw, Galati rama mi invêthai, tûin am a dâwi cheu a, in mithmu ngeiah Isu Krista chu hemdein chiengtaka inlangtir a ni vei leh?"
"This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?","Hi chau hi in kuoma inthawkin lo hriet ka nuom: Dân thilthawhai leiin am Thlarau chu in hmuh a, in ngaithlâka in ring leiin? Hieng lâwm hin in invêt a ni maw?"
"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?",Thlaraua ṭan ta siin tisain in zo ding a ni maw?
Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.,Thil chuong zât zât chu a thlâwn elin in tuor a ni maw? A thlâwn hlawl el chu ni lo e!
"He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?","Chun, in kuoma Thlarau petu cheu le nangni laia thilmak thawtu chun Dân thilthawhai leiin am a thawh a, in ngaithlâka in ring leiin?"
"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.",Abrahamin Pathien a ring a; chu ringna chu a felnaa ruot a ni ang khan.
"Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.","Chuleiin, hre ro, ringnaa umhai, chuonghai ngei chu Abraham nauhai an nih."
"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.","Pathien Lekha thu chun, Pathienin ringna leiin Jentailhai thiem ân changtir ding a nih ti hre lâwkin, “Nangmaa chun hnam tin malsâwmpêkin um an tih,” tiin Abraham kuomah Chanchin Ṭha chu a hril lâwk kha."
So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.,"Chuongchun, ringnaa umhai chu Abraham ringum le chun malsâwm- pêkin an um hlak a nih."
"For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.","Dân thilthawa um taphawthai chu ṭawngse hnuoiah an um sih a, “Dân Lekhabua thu ziek po po anga thaw dinga um zing naw taphawt chu ṭawngsephurin an um hlak,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
"Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;","Chun, Pathien mithmuin tû- khawm Dân leiin thiem chang an um nawh ti ân lang zing a nih, “Ringna leia mifel chu hring a tih,” ti a ni sih a,"
"and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.","chun, Dân chu ringnaa inthawk a ni nawh a, “Chuong anga thawtu chu chuonga chun hring a tih,” ti a ni lem."
"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:","Krista chu ei aia ṭawngsephur chu lo niin, Dân ṭawngsiea inthawk chun a mîn tlan suok tah a; (“Thinga khaikâng taphawt chu ṭawngsephur an nih,” ti ziek a ni sih a)."
that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.,"Chuongchun, Abraham chunga malsâwmna chu Krista Isua chun Jentailhai chungah hung um thei a ta; chuongchun, ringna leiin Thlarau tiem chu hmu thei ei tih."
"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.","Unauhai, mihriem angin ka hril hi, mihriem thuthlung khawm ni sien la, sukdet ta hnungin an sût nâwk ta ngai nawh a, bel khawm an belsa ngai bawk nawh."
"Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.","Chun, Abraham kuomah a nih thu chu tiema a lo um chu, a chithla kuoma khawm. Mi tamtak chungthu hril angin, “Chithlahai kuoma khawm,” a ti nawh a, mi pakhat chungthu hril angin, “I chithla kuoma khawm,” a ti lem a nih, chu chu Krista chu a nih."
"Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.","Chun, hienghin ka ti a nih: Thuthlung Pathienin a lo sukdet ta chu, Dân kum za li sâwmthum hnunga hung um ta khan thutiem chu iengkhawm loa siemin a sukbo nawh a."
"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.","Rohluo ding chu Dân lei a ni chun thutiem lei ni ta naw nih a; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin thutiem leiin a nih Abraham kuoma a pêk chu."
"What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.","Annawleh, iengtiziea Dân chu um am a ni leh: Chithla thutiemna chu a hung hmakhat chu bawsiet- nahai leiin belsain a um a, vântir- kohai hmanga palai kuta rêl a nih."
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.,"Chun, palai hrim hrim mi pakhat inkâra palai a ni ngai nawh a; Pathien ruok chu pakhat a nih."
"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.","Annawleh, Dân chun Pathien thutiemhai chu a kal am a nih? Teu lo e a! Dân mi sukhringthei hrim hrim pêkin a um ta si chun, felna chu Dân leiin a um ngei ding a nih."
"But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.","Nisienlakhawm, Isu Krista ring leia thiltiem chu ringtuhai kuoma pêk a ni theina dingin, Pathien Lekha thu chun suol hnuoiah iengkim a khârkhip ta vawng a."
"But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.","Nisienlakhawm, ringna a hung tlung hma khan, ringna hung inlang ding ta dinga khârkhipa Dân hnuoia vêng ei ni kha."
"So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.","Chuongchun, Dân chu ringna leia thiem ei chang theina dinga Krista kuom tienga a mi keihruoitu a lo nih."
"But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.","Nisienlakhawm, tuta ringna a hung tlung hnung hin, keihruoitu hnuoiah ei um ta nawh a."
"For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.",Isu Krista ring leiin Pathien nauhai in ni vawng sih a.
For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.,Nangni laia Kristaa baptisma chang phawthai kha Krista chun in inthuom ta sih a.
"There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus.","Chutaka chun Juda mi an um thei nawh a, Grik mi khawm an um thei bawk nawh; suok an um thei nawh a, suoknaw khawm an um thei bawk nawh; nuhmei le pasal khawm an um thei nawh; Krista Isua chun in rêngin pumkhat in ni sih a."
"And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.","Chun, Krista ta in ni chun, Abraham thla, thutiem anga ro- hluotu dinghai in nih."
"But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;","Nisienlakhawm, hienghin ka ti a nih: Rohluotu ding chu iengkim chunga hotu ni sien la khawm, naupang a la ni sûng chu suok leh danglamna a la nei chuong nawh."
but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.,A pa ruot hun chu a hung tlung hmakhat chu vêngtu le enkawltuhai hnuoiah a um lem a nih.
"So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:","Chuong angin eini khawm naupang ei ni lai khan, khawvêl A AW B hnuoiah suokin ei um."
"but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,","Nisienlakhawm, a hunbi a hung kim khan, Pathienin a Naupa, nuh- mei inei, Dân hnuoia hung piengin, a tir suok tah a,"
"that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",nau nina ei hmu theina dinga Dân hnuoia umhai chu intlan dingin.
"And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.","Chun, nau in ni leiin Pathienin a Naupa Thlarau chu, “Abba! (Pa!)” tia khêkin, ei lungrilah a hung tir a."
"So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.","Chuongchun, suok i ni ta nawh a, nau i ni lem; chun, nau i ni chun Pathien zâra rohluotu ding i nih."
"Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:","Nisienlakhawm, khânga Pathien in hriet naw lai khan, an piengzie hrim khawma Pathien ni dêrlohai suok in na."
"but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?","Tuta Pathien in hung hriet hnung hin chu — ti nêk hmanin, Pathien mi hriet in hung ni hnung hin chu, ti ding a ni lem — khawvêl A AW B derdêp le teplo mei mei, a suoka um nâwk in inhâwkhai tienga chun, iengtiziea nghakîr nâwk am in na?"
"Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.","Nihai, thlahai, hunhai, kumhai in inser hlak."
"I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.",In ta dingin tha ka sêng thlâwn el rawi am ti hi kân lau pêk cheu.
"I beseech you, brethren, become as I am, for I also am become as ye are. Ye did me no wrong:","Unauhai, ka ngên cheu a nih, keia angin um ro, kei khawm nangni angin ka um sih a. Ka pawi iengkhawm in tâwk nawh."
but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:,"Chanchin Ṭha in kuoma ka hril hmasak ṭum kha, ka tisa hrâtnawna lei a nih ti in hriet sih a."
"and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.","Chun, ka taksaa in ta dinga thlêmna um chu in hmusit naw a, in tirdak naw bawk a; Pathien vântirko angin, Krista Isu ang elin, in mi lâwm lem ta kha."
"Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.","Vângnei in intina kha khâwlai am a um tah a? Thaw thei ruol chu ni lem sien la, nangnîn in mithai kheldawkin mi pe tâng in tih ti ka hriet pêk cheu in sawnnaw."
"So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?","Chuongchun, thu indiktak ka hril cheu leiin in hmêlma ka lo ni tah a ni maw?"
"They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.","Ṭhat tiengah ni dêr si loin, nasatakin an ngaisak hlak cheu a, anni in ngaisak theina dingin keinia inthawka ṭhethlâk cheu tum an ni tak."
"But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.","Thu ṭha tienga ruok chu, ieng lai khawmin, ṭhahnemngaitaka zawnga um rawp hi a ṭha a nih, in kuoma ka um lai chau ni loin."
"My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you—","Ka nauhai, Krista chu nangnia siem puitlinga a um hmakhat chu nauha invawiin kân vawi nâwk cheu hi."
"but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.","Anih, tulai hin in kuoma uma ka rawl sukdanglam kân hâwk thei zie chu, in chungthuah ka lunginzîng sih a."
"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?","Dân hnuoia um nuomhai, mi hril ta u, Dân thu chu in ngai hlak naw am a nih?"
"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.","Hieng ang hin ziek a ni sih a, “Abrahamin naupasal pahni a nei a, pakhat chu a suoknu leh, pakhat chu a suoknawnu leh."
Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise.,"Nisienlakhawm, suoknu le nau chu tisa dân angin a pieng a, suoknawnu le nau ruok chu thutiem leiin a pieng a nih,” ti hi."
"Which things contain an allegory: for these women are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.","Chuong thu chu tekhina a nih: chuong nuhmeihai chu thuthlung pahni an nih, pakhat chu Sinai tlânga mi suok ni dinga nau neitu chu, chu chu Hagar a nih."
Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.,"Chun, Hagar hi Arabia rama Sinai tlâng chu a nih Jerusalem tulaia um le hin angkhat an nih; a nauhai leh suokah an um sih a."
"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.","Chungtieng Jerusalem ruok chu suok a ni nawh a, chu ngei chu eini nu a nih."
"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.","“Nang ching, nau nei ngai lo hlim rawh. Nang nauha invawi ngai lo khêk suok rawh; Pasal nei mi nêk chun khawsâwtnu chun Nauhai a nei tam lem sih a,” ti ziek a ni kha."
"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.","Chuongchun, unauhai, eini hi Isak ang khan thutiem nauhai ei nih."
"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so also it is now.","Chun, chuong lai chun, tisa dâna hung pieng khan, Thlarau dâna hung pieng chu a suknawmna a, tu khawm hin chuong ang bawk chu a nih."
Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Lekha thuin iengtin am a hril a? “Suoknu chu, a naupa leh hnawtdawk rawh, suoknu naupa chun suoknawnu naupa chu ro a hluopui âwm si nawh a,” a tih a."
"Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.","Chuongchun, unauhai, suoknu nauhai ei ni nawh a, suoknawnu le nauhai ei ni lem."
"For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.","Suok ni lo dingin Krista chun a mîn suoktir kha; chuongchun, ngir det unla, suok ringkawla chun intâng nâwk ta naw ro."
"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.","Ngai ta u, kei Paulain in kuomah ka hril hi, ser in intantir chun Krista chu in ta dingin iengkhawm ṭhahnemna ni naw ni."
"Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.","Anih, Dân thu po po zâwm dinga battu an nih ti, ser intantir taphawt kuomah kân hriettir nâwk a nih."
"Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.","Nangni Dâna thiem chang tumtuhai, Krista leh in inṭhe tah a, lunginsietna chu in tlûksan tah."
For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.,Keini chun Thlarau zârah ring- nain felna beiseina kan nghâk sih a.
"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.","Krista Isua chun sertan ieng- khawm a ṭhahnem nawh a, sertan- naw khawm iengkhawm a ṭhahnem chuong nawh, ringna hmangainaa thaw ruok chu a ṭhahnem a nih."
Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?,"Ṭhatakin in tlân hlak kha, thutak chu in zâwm nawna dingin tuin am a hluo ta cheu a?"
This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.,Hi thlêmna hi a kotu cheua inthawk a ni nawh.
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.,Chawl tlâwmtêin bei tlang chu a pumin a fang suok hlak.
"I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.","Ngaituo danglam naw ti niu ti Lalpaa chun kei chun nangni tieng ka ring cheu a nih; nisienlakhawm, a sukbuoitu cheu chu, tûkhawm ni sien la, a chunga rorêlna chu la tuor a tih."
"But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.","Unauhai, keiin sertan thu ka la hril rawp si chun, ieng dinga suknawmnata la um rawp am ka na? Chuong ang a ni si chun kraws insuina chu sukbo ni tâng a tih."
I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.,A sukbuoitu cheu chu intan thla law law sien ka nuom a nih.
"For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.","Nangni, unauhai, suok ni lo dinga ko in ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, suok in ni nawna chu tisa ta dinga remchângah hmang naw unla, hmangainain rawng inbâwl tuo pêk seng lem ro,"
"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.","“Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai i hmangai ding a nih,” ti thu baukhata hin Dân thu po po chu a famkim tah a ni sih a."
"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.","Nisienlakhawm, in inseh a, in infâk tuo si chun, in insukbohmang tuo nawna dingin fîmkhur ro."
"But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.","Chuongchun, hi hi ka ti a nih: Thlarauah um ro; chuongchun, tisa châkna chu in zâwm naw ding annâwm."
"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.","Tisa hin Thlarau dona tieng ân hâwk hlak, Thlarau khawmin tisa dona tieng ân hâwk bawk si hlak a, thil thaw in itumhai chu in thaw thei nawna dingin chuonghai chu an inkal sih a."
"But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.","Nisienlakhawm, Thlarau ṭhuoia in um chun, Dân hnuoia chun in um nawh."
"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,","Chun, tisa thilthawhai chu ân lang fel a nih; chuong chu hieng hi an nih: inditna dâm, inthiengnawna dâm, hurna dâm,"
"idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,","milim biekna dâm, dawithiem- na dâm, theidâna dâm, inhalna dâm, thîkna dâm, lungsenna dâm, mani- hmasielna dâm, insuktumna dâm, ring tumna dâm,"
"envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.","thîkthusietna dâm, zu inruina dâm, zu hmun hlimna dâm, chuong anghai chu, chuong kawnga chun kha hmaa, “Chuong ang thil thawtuhai chun Pathien ram hluo naw ni hai,” tia ka hril lâwk cheu ang khan, ka hril nâwk cheu hi."
"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,","Thlarau ra ruok chu hmangaina dâm, hlimna dâm, inremna dâm, dawtheina dâm, ngilneina dâm, ṭhatna dâm, ringumna dâm,"
"meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.","thuhnuoirawlna dâm, insûm- thei na dâm a ni lem: chuong ang kal zâwngin Dân thupêk hrim a um nawh."
And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.,"Chun, Krista Isu mihai chun tisa chu a suol ngaituona le a châknahai pumin an hemde tah."
"If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.","Thlaraua hring ei ni chun, Thlaraua vêk um ei tiu."
"Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.","Inchotuoin, in itthîktuoin inngaihlu nâwng ei tiu."
"Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.","Unauhai, mi suol iengkhawm a thaw laia phâwkin um sien la, nangni thlarau mihai, “Thlemna tuok ve rawi ka tih,” tia invêng ṭha pumin chuong ang mi chu thuhnuoirawl- takin tungding nâwk ro."
"Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.","In rikphurhai chu insâwngtuo ro; chuongchun, Krista dân chu in zâwm nîng a tih."
"For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.","Mi iengkhawm ni si loin, mi lien deua ân ngai chun, ân hlêm fâwm el a ni sih a."
"But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.","Mi tinin mani thilthaw infie seng lem raw hai se, chu hnunga chun, mi dang chungah ni loin, mani chung chauah suong ding nei an tih."
For each man shall bear his own burden.,Mi tinin mani phur an phur seng ding a ni sih a.
But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.,"Chun, thu inchûktir dawngtu chun, thilṭha po po inchûktirtu kuomah pe ve raw se."
"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.","Hlêmin um naw ro; Pathien chu hmusit zie a ni nawh; miin a ithe ang ang, chu bawk chu a sîk ding a ni sih a."
For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.,Mani tisa tienga thetu chun tisaa sietna chu sîk a tih; Thlarau tienga thetu ruok chun Thlaraua chatuona hringna a sîk ding a nih.
"And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.","Chuongchun, thil ṭha thaw chu nghawk nâwng ei tiu, ei inhlêmsan naw chun a hun taka chun ei sîk ngei ding a nih."
"So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.","Chuongchun, remchâng hun ei nei ang peiin mi po po kuomah thil ṭha chu thâwng ei tiu, ringna sûnghai laia mi chungah thaw bîk tak ei tiu."
See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.,Keima kut ngeiin in kuomah lekha inhrawl pherphura ka ziek hi en ta u.
"As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.","Tisaa hmêl insukmawi nuomhai poin sertana um dingin an tir lui hlak cheu a nih; ieng dang lei khawm a ni nawh a, Krista kraws leia suk- nawmnatna an tuor nawna ding chau a nih."
"For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",Sertanhai meu khawm chun Dân thu an zâwm chuong si nawh a; in tisaa chun suong ding an nei theina dingin ser intantir cheu an nuom el a nih.
"But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.","Kei ruok chun ei Lalpa Isu Krista kraws naw chu ka suong naw ding zie chu, chu zâra chun khawvêl hi ka ta dinga hemdein a um tah, kei khawm khawvêl ta dinga hemdein ka um a nih."
"For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.","Siem thar nâwkna naw chu sertan hi iengkhawm a ni nawh a, sertannaw khawm iengkhawm a ni chuong bawk nawh."
"And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.","Chun, chu dân anga um taphawthai chunga chun inremna le lunginsietna um raw se, Pathien Israelhai chunga khawm."
Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.,"Tuta chen chu tûkhawmin mi sukbuoi ta naw raw hai se, ka tisaa hin Isu inchiknahai ka put sih a."
"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.","Unauhai, Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna in thlarau kuomah um raw se. Amen."
