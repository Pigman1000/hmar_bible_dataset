The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.,Zâwlnei Habakkukin chungrikna a hmu chu:
"O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.","Aw LALPA, ka ko chein, iengchen am, Ngai loa i um ding chu? “Inpâwngnêkna” tiin ka ko che a. I sandam naw el ding chu?"
"Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.","Iengdinga suolnahai hi i mîn hmutirin, Iengdinga lungngaina hi i mîn entir am a na? Suksietna le inpâwngnêkna chu ka hmaa hin a um a, Insuolna a um a, indona a hung suok hlak a nih."
"Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.","Chuleiin, dân chu a dul a, rorêlna chu a zîksuok thei nawh a, Mi rilohai chun mi fel chu an inhuol vêl sih a; Chuleichun, rorêlna chu a fe suol hlak a nih."
"Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.","Nangni hnamhai laia mihai, en ta u, Ngaisak unla, maktitakin ngaituo ro. Hril ni unla khawm in âwi nâw ding In hunahai hin sin ka thaw ding a nih."
"For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.","Ngai ro, Kaldaihai kân ngîr suok a nih, Hnam ti rawk rawk le khatak elhai chu. Anni chu, anni ta khawm ni lo umna hmunhai chu, Nei dingin hnuoi khang dâpin an hung a."
They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.,Anni chu ṭium le pangzatumtak an na; Annia inthawk chun an rorêl le inlalna chu a fe suok a.
"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.","An sakawrhai chu keitêhai nêkin an hrât lem a, Zântienga satenehai nêkin ṭi an um lem a nih; An sakawr chung chuongmihai chu chapotakin an inân a; Anih, an sakawr chung chuongmihai chu hlataka inthawkin an hung a, Mupui sa baw vuong angin a vuongin an vuong a."
They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.,"An rêngin pâwngnêk dingin an hung a, Khawsak thli ang elin an hmêlhai chun a ngerin an nger a, Salmanhai chu phaiphin angin an lâk khâwm a."
"Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.","Anih, lalhai chu an nuisan a, Mi lienhai chu an ta ding chun hmusitum an nih a, Kul det tinrênghai chu an nuisan a, pilvut a sungvûmin a lâk nâwk hlak sih a."
"Then shall he sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, even he whose might is his god.","Thli angin an mût a, bâwthleng an ta, Thiemnaw changin um an tih, Anni thilthawtheina ngei pathiena neituhai chu."
"Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka Mi Inthieng, Nang chu chatuona inthawk tah i ni nâwm a nih? Thi nâwng kan tih. Aw LALPA, ama chu rorêlna dingin i ruot a, Aw lungpui, nangin ama chu sukdikna dingin în ngîr a ni kha."
"Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;","Nang chu suolna hmûna hlak nêka mit inthieng lem nei i na, Khawhlona chu i en thei naw a nih, Chuleiin, khawhlotaka thawtuhai chu hmu zingin, Mi riloin ama nêka mi fel lem a lem zo lai khawmin, Iengdinga i tosan ṭawk ṭawk am?"
"and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?","Mihriemhai chu tuisuoriet ngahai anga, Thilhring bawka invâk, an chunga rorêltu nei lohai Anga siemtu chu i ni nâwm a nih?"
"He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.","Ama chun anni po po chu ngakuoiin a lâk a, A lênin a man tâwl a, A keihrui chun a hnûk khâwm a; Chuleichun, a hlimin a lâwm a nih."
"Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.","Chuongchun, a lên kuoma chun ân thâwi a, A keihrui kuoma chun riminhnik a rawh a, Anni zâra a chan chu a hung thâu a, A bu chu a hung tam leiin."
"Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?","Chuleiin, a lên chu sukruok nâwk hlakin, Hnamhai that zing el chu a ma naw ding am a nih?"
"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint.","Ka vêngbûk chunga chun ngîr ka ta, ka kulbîng chunga chun um ka ta, kâwk ka ni phaha ka dawnna ding le ka kuoma ieng am a hril ding ti hmu dingin nghâk zing ka tih."
"And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.","Chun, LALPA chun a mi hung dawn a, “Inlârna thu chu ziek la, Lungphêkhai chunga chun fietak elin, A tiemtu chun tlân puma a tiem theina dingin."
"For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.","Inlârna hi hun ruota hung tlung ding a la na, A tâwp chu a hnai mêk zing a, inkhêl bawk naw nih; A muong khawma nghâk zing la, A hung tlung ngei ding a ni leiin,” tiin."
"Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.","En ta u, a lungril chu a chapo a, amaa chun ân dik naw a nih, Mi fel ruok chu a ringna lei chun hring a tih."
"Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.","Anih, chu nawa khawm uoin he chu bawsetu, Mi chapo, a ina um ngailo chu a nih; Ama chun a châkna chu hrem- hmun angin a suklien a, Ama chu thina ang a na, suktlai ruol a ni nawh. Chi po pohai chu a kuoma chun a kei khâwmin, Hnam po pohai chu a kuomah a lâk khâwm lem a nih."
"Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!","Hieng po pohai hin ama chunga tekhina hung hrilin, ama chunga hrilinsîm thu hrilin, “Ama ta ni si loa insukpung chu ieng chen am nei a ta? Mâni le mâni banda insiekhumtu chung chu a va rik de!” an ti naw dîm a nih?"
"Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them?","Anni chun thâwklekhatin nang hung sêtu ding che chu suktho an ta, Hmatieng hnungtienga nawrtu ding chu hung sukharin, An ta dinga râllâk thil i ni el naw ding maw?"
"Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.","Hnam tamtak i suksiet ta leiin, mihriem thisen le Ram le khawpui le a sûnga chênghai chunga Mihriem thisen le inpâwngnêk- na thil lo thaw ta po po lei khan, Nang khawm chi a la um sun- hai po po chun sukse vêng an ti che."
"Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!","Mi suol kuta inthawka sansuok a ni theina dinga, A bû insângtaka a sep theina dinga, A insûng ta dinga hlâwkna indik naw latu chu a chung a rik ie!"
"Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.","Mi tamtak chu sât thlain, I insûng ta ding chun inzakna în tlun tah a; I hringna chung ngeia khawm thil i suksuol tah a nih."
"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.","Banga inthawk chun lung chuhung khêksuok a ta, Thing laia tlungpûm chun a hung dawn ding a ni sih a."
"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!","Khuo chu thisena indin a, Khawpui chu khawhlonaa inngîrtu chung chu a rik ie!"
"Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?","En ta u, hnamhai chu teploah anni an insuklungkham a, Chi tinhai chun mei ta dinga sin an inrim hi, Sipaihai LALPAA inthawk ni lo am a nih?"
"For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.","Tuisuoriet chu tuihaiin ân khum angin, LALPA ropuina hrietna chun hnuoi hi a suksip ding a ni sih a."
"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, to thee that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!","A tuolbâwm kuoma dâwn ding pe a, Chutaka chun a tûr chu pawl a, An saruokna chu a hmu theina dinga Sukruitu chung chu a rik ie!"
"Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.","Ropuina dinga inzaknaasuksip i ni tah a, Nang khawma dâwn la, saruok chu ni el rawh! LALPA kut changtienga no chu i kuomah pêk nîng a ta, I ropuina chunga chun inzakna tirdakum chu um a tih!"
"For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.","Lebanon chunga inpâwng- nêkna le, Ramsahai chunga suksietna, anni sukṭi hlakna chun, Ram le khawpui le a sûnga chênghai chunga le, Mihriemhai thisen le thil lo thaw ta po po lei chun, Nang chu ân khum ding che a nih."
"What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?","Milem a kera ker, a siemtuin a iker chun Ieng am ṭhangkaina a nei? Milim a sunga sung le khêlhlip inchûktirtu, Milim ṭawng thei nawhai siem a, A siemtuin ama sinthaw nâk nâk a ringzoa hin, Ṭhangkâina ieng am a um a?"
"Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.","Thing kuoma chun, “Harrawh,” ti a, Lung kuoma chun, “Tho rawh,” titu chu a chung a rik ie! Hi hin ân chûktir ding am a nih? En ta u, rângkachak le tangkaruo inluon khum a na, Amaa hin inthuokna hrim a um dêr nawh."
But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.,"LALPA ruok chu a biekininthienga chun a um a, Leihnuoi po po chu a hmaah to ṭhiep raw se."
"A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.",Sigionoth chunga zâwlnei Habak- kuk ṭawngṭaina chu:
"O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.","Aw LALPA, i ṭawng ka hriet a,ka ṭi tah a; Aw LALPA, hieng kumhai sûng hin i sinthaw chu hung sukhar rawh. Kumhai laia hin hung inhriettir la, Lunginsennaa khawm zângaina chu hre zing rawh."
"God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. [Selah His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.","Pathien chu Temana inthawkina hung a. Mi Inthieng chu Paran tlânga inthawkin. A ropuina chun vânhai chu ân khum a, Leihnuoi chu ân pâknain a sip a nih."
And his brightness was as the light; He had rays coming forth from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.,"A êngna chu var ang a na; A kuta inthawk chun varkêhai a hung suok a, A thilthawtheina inbîkna chu a um a nih."
"Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.",A hmaa chun hri chu a feh a; A kehaia inthawk chun meiling inling a fe suok a.
"He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were as of old.","A ngîr a, hnuoi chu ân hnîng a; Hnamhai chu a en a, a hnawt dar tah a; Kumkhaw tlânghai khawm chu sukdarin an um a, Chatuon muolhai chu an kûn bawk a; A lampuihai chu chatuona mi an nih."
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.,Kushan puon inhai chu sukrimsika a um lai kahmuh a; Midian ram puonzârhai chu ân thin a.
"Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?","LALPA chu vadunghai chungachun a lungawi naw am anih? Vadunghai chunga chun i lunginsenna chu a umin, Tuisuoriet chunga chun i lunginsenna chu a um am a nih? I sakawrhai chunga chun i chuongin, I sandamna sakawr tawlailîr- haia chun i chuong hi?"
Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. [Selah Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.,"I thalngul chu sukruok dêr ana; Thalhai chu a hruiah înbûk a, Nang chun leihnuoi chu vadunghaiin i thlêr tah a."
"The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.","Tlânghai chun an hmu cheh a,an ṭih a; Tui insawkhai khawm chu an fe hmang tah a; Li inthûk chun a râwl ânsuoh a, A kuthai chu chungtieng a phar a."
"The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.","Nisa le thla chu an umnaachun an ngîr zing a, I thalhai kâp suoka umhai vara le, I fei tle zawr zawr vara chun."
Thou didst march through the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.,"Lunginthakin ram chu i fethleng a, Lunginsenin hnamhai chu i chîl hrep a."
"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. [Selah","I mihai sandamna dingin i fesuok a, I hriek nâl sandamna ding chun. Mi rilo sûngkuoa inthawk chun lu chu i sukhliem a, Ring chenin a lungphûm chu i suklang tah a."
Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.,"A indo mihai lu chu amahmawl ngei chun i sun- thleng a, Kei mi sukdar dingin thlivir angin an hung a: An hlimna chu mi rimsi chu inrûka fâk hmang chu a nih."
"Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.","I sakawrhai le chun tuisuoriet chu i chîl tah a, Tui nasatak umkhâwmhaichu."
"I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.","Ka hriet a, ka phîngsûng chuân thin a, Ka hmûrhai chu râwlria chun ân thin hlawp hlawp a; Ka ruhaia chun hmawnna a hung lût a, chuongchun, ka hmuna chun kân thin a nih; Buoina nia chun châwl kata, Mipui, sipai pâwl anga mi rûntu chunga an hung tlung pha chun."
"For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:","Theichang kûng chu pâr naw sien khawm, Grêphruia chun a ra um naw bawk sien khawm; Oliv leia sin inrimna chu hung thlâwnin, Lohai chun bu insuo naw bawk hai sien; Berâm ruol chu a ina inthawka sât thlâka umin, Bâwng ina chun bâwng ruol khawm um naw bawk hai sien khawm,"
"Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.","LALPAA chun hlim ka ta, Ka sandamna Pathiena chun lâwm ka tih."
"Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, And will make me to walk upon my high places. For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.","Lalpa, Jehova chu ka hrâtna a na, Ka kehai chu sazukpui kehai angin a siem a, Ama chun ka bâwlhmunhaia chun mîn fetir a tih."
