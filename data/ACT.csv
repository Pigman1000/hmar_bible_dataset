"The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,","Theophil, kha hmaa lekhaa khan, Isu thilthaw le a închûktir phut lai thu po po kha ka ziek a nih;"
"until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen:","Thlarau Inthieng ṭhangpuia a tirko thlanghai kuoma thu a tiem zoa, vân tienga ṭhuoia a um ni chena thu kha."
"to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:","Chu tirkohai kuoma chun rinum chu a tuor hnungin inhriettirna tam- takin hringin ân entir a, ni sâwmli zet an kuomah ân lâr a, Pathien ram thu a hril hlak."
"and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me:","Chun, an umkhâwm dâm a pâwl veh a, “Jerusalem fe san naw ro, Pathien thiltiem ka hril in hriet kha lo nghâk ro,” a ti tlat a."
for John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.,"“Johan khan tuiin a baptis hlak a, nisienlakhawm, ni sâwtnawtêah Thlarau Inthiengin baptisma chang in tih,” a ta."
"They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?","Chun, anni chun an hung inkhâwmin a kuomah, “Lalpa, tuhin am a ni Israelhai kuoma ram i pêk nâwk ding?” an ta, an indawn a."
"And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Pain a hun le a ni ama thu thua um dinga a ruot chu nangni lo hriet ding a ni nawh ie."
"But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.","Nisienlakhawm, Thlarau In- thieng chu in chungah a hung tlung pha leh thilthawtheina la nei in tih; chuongchun, Jerusalema dâm, Judai le Samari ram khaw tina dâm, kâwlkawdawng chenin ka thu hretuhai nîng in tih,” a ta."
"And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril zoin an hmu zing pumin, vân tienga ṭhuoiin a um a; chun, sûmin an hmu phâk nawah a ṭhuoi hmang tah a."
"And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold two men stood by them in white apparel;","Chun, a hang fe laia vân tieng an en zing laiin, mi pahni puon vâr silin an kâwlah an hung ngîr a."
"who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.","Chuonghai chun, “Galili rama mihai, iengdinga vân tieng nghaa in ngir am? Hi Isu in kuoma inthawka vân tienga ṭhuoia um hi, vâna a hang fe in hmu ang bawk hin ama ngei hi hung nâwk a tih,” an ta."
"Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey off.","Chun, Oliv tlâng an tia inthawk chun Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a; chu tlâng chu Jerusalem kâwl a nih. Châwlnia lêngna tâwk chau a nih."
"And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.","Chun, an lûtin an umna pindan chunghnunga chun an hang feh a Peter le Johan leh, Jakob le Andri leh, Philip le Thoma leh, Bartholomai le Matthai leh, Alphai naupa Jakob leh, Simon Zelot pâwla mi le Jakob naupa Juda leh an nih."
"These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.","Chuonghai po po chun nuhmei tuhai amani le Isu nu Mari leh, Isu unauhai leh, lungril hmunkhata ṭhahnemngaitaka ṭawngṭaiin an um a."
"And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty),","Chun, chu ni chun unauhai lai Peter a ngîr a, (an rêng chun za le sâwmhni lai an nih),"
"Brethren, it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.","“Unauhai, Thlarau Inthiengin, David baua, Isu mantuhai ṭhuoitu Juda thu a hrillâwk kha, kha Pathien Lekha Thu kha hung tlung ding a ni hrim a nih."
"For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.","Ama chu eini laia tiemsa a na, hieng rawngbâwlnaa hin chan khawm a nei ve sih a."
"(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.","(Chun, ama chun a suol manin hmun pakhat ân chawk a, a bawkkhupin a tlah a, a laiah a puok kawi a, a rîl po po a suok vawng a."
"And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)","Chun, chuong thu chu Jerusalema umhai po poin an lo hriet a; chuongchun, chu hmun chu anni ṭawngin, ‘Akeldama,’ an tih a, chu chu, ‘Thisen hmun,’ tina a nih.)"
"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be made desolate, And let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take.","Inpâkna Hla Buah hi thu hi ziek a nih:- ‘A umna sukramin um raw se A sûngah tukhawm um naw raw se,’ ti le, ‘A hotu nîna chu mi dangin chang raw se,’ ti hi."
"Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,","“Chuongchun, Lal Isu eini laia lût hlak, suok hlaka a um sûng po a,"
"beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.","Johan Baptisma chena in- thawka ei kuoma inthawka vâna ṭhuoia a um ni chen kha - hieng a mi pâwl hlakhai laia mi pakhat, a thonâwkna mi hrietpuitu dingin a um ding a nih,” a ta."
"And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.","Chun, mi pahni an ruot a, pakhat chu Josef Barsabba an ti chu, (a hming dang Justa an ti bawk a). Chun, pakhat chu Matthia a nih."
"And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,","Chun, an ṭawngṭai a, “Lalpa, Nang mihriem po po lungril hretu, hienghai hi a tu lem am i thlang mîn hriettir la;"
"to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.","Juda chun ama umnaa a fe theina dinga hieng rawngbâwlna le tirko sin a tlâwmsan ai awtu dingin,” an ta."
And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.,"Chun, ai an sânpêk a, an aisân chu Matthia chungah a tlu a. Chuongchun, ama chu tirko sâwm le pakhat hai lai chun tiemsa a ni tah a."
"Now there was a certain man in Cæsarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,","Chun, Kaisari khuoah a hming Korneli mi pakhat a um a; Itali pâwl an ti, chu pâwla sipai za hotu a nih."
"a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.","Pathien ngaisak mi a na, a sûnghai po po leh Pathien an ṭi hlak a; mihai kuomah thil tamtak a pêk hlak a, Pathien kuoma khawm an ṭawngṭai rawp a."
"He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.","Ama chun chawhnung inher hin, mang angin fietakin Pathien vântir- ko pakhat a kuoma lûta, “Korneli,” tiin a hmuh a."
"And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God.","Chun, Korneli chun ama chu a lo en zing a, a ṭih a, “Lalpa, ieng am a na?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “I ṭawngṭainahai le i thil pêk thuhai kha hriet zing dingin Pathien hmaah a hang tlung tah."
"And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:","Tuhin Joppa khuoah mihai tir la, mi pakhat Simon Peter an ti chu, hang inṭhuoitir rawh."
"he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.","Savun siemtu Simon kuoma tlung a nih, a in chu tuisuoriet pangah a um,” a ta."
"And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;","Chun, vântirko a betu chu a fe phingleh, Korneli chun, a siehlawhai laia mi pahni le a rawngbâwl rawphai laia Pathien ngaisak sipai pakhat a ko a;"
"and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.","chun, thu po po chu an kuoma a hril zoin Joppa khuoa chun a tir tah a."
"Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:","Chun, a zînga an fe laia khaw kâwl an tlung laiin, Peter chu ṭawngṭai dingin, sûnbu fâk hun laiin, in chungah a hang lawn a."
"and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;","Chun a phîng a hung ṭâm a, bu fâk a nuom tah a; nisienlakhawm, fâk ding an siem lai chun zêlin a um tah a."
"and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth:","Vân inhawngin, iengkhat bâwm puon lientak ang, a ki palia khita, hnuoiah inkhaithlain a hmuh a."
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.,"Chu sûnga chun sapheimanli- hai le, thilhring le chunga vate tinrênghai an um a."
"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.","Chun, a kuomah rawlin, “Peter tho rawh; that la fa rawh,” a hung tih a."
"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chun, “Lalpa, ni lo e; thiengnaw le, inthiengnaw iengkhawm ka fâk ngai nawh ie,” a ta."
"And a voice came unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.","Chun, rawl chun vawihninaah, “Pathienin a sukthieng ta chu nangin thiengnaw ti naw rawh,” a ta."
And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.,"Chuong ang ruok chun, vawi thum a hung um a; chun, bâwm chu vâ- na zuk khaiin a um nâwk nghâl tah a."
"Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood before the gate,","Chun, Peterin mang anga a hmu chu a ngaina hre loa a lunginzîng laiin, Korneli mi tirhai chun Simon in chu an lo indawn suok tah a, kawtkhâr bulah an lo ngîr a,"
"and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.","an khêk a, Simon, Peter an ti chu, chutaka chun a tlung le tlung naw an indawn a."
"And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.","Chun, Peterin a mang thu chu a ngaituo laiin, Thlarauin a kuomah, “Ngai ta, mi pathumin an zawng che."
"But arise, and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them.","Chuongchun, tho la, ṭum la, iengkhawm ringhla loin anni zui rawh; anni chu ka itir an nih,” a ta."
"And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?","Chuongchun, Peter chu chuhai kâwla chun a ṭum a, an kuomah, “In izawng hi ka nih; ieng am in hungna san?” a ta."
"And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.","Anni chun, “Vântirko inthieng pakhatin, Korneli, sipai za hotu mi feltak, Pathien ṭi Juda hnam po pohai khawma an ingaisâng kuoma chun, i thu hril a hrietna dingin, a inah nang ko ding chein a hril a nih,” an ta."
"So he called them in and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.","Chuongchun, mihai chu a ko lût a, ân riek tir tah a. A zînga chun Peter chu a tho a, an kuomah a feh a, Joppa khuoa mi unau tuhai amani khawm anni leh an fe veh a."
"And on the morrow they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends.","Chun, a zing nâwk chun Kaisari khuoa chun an lût tah a. Chun, Korneli chun a laibunghai le a ruol dittakhai a ko khâwm a, anni chu a lo nghâk zing a."
"And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.","Chun, Peter chu a lût ding lai takin Korneli chun a lo tuok a, a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, Pathien chibai bûk angin a bûk a."
"But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin ama chu a keitho a, “Ngîr rawh, kei khawm mihriem ka ni hi,” a ta."
"And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together:","Chun, a kâwla thu hril pumin a lût a, mi tamtak umkhâwm chu a va hmuh a."
"and he said unto them, Ye yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come unto one of another nation; and yet unto me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean:","An kuomah, “Juda mîn hnam dang kuoma fe le pâwl a thieng nawzie nangnîn in hriet a nih; nisienlakhawm, tukhawm thiengnaw le inthiengnaw ka ti ding an nawh ti Pathienin a mîn hriettir a nih."
"wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me.","Chuleiin, in mi hung ko phingle khan sêl loin ka hung a ni hi. Chuongchun, kân dawn cheu, ieng am a na in mi hung ko san?” a ta."
"And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel,","Chun, Korneli chun, “Ni li a ni tah, tu phâ ang chen hin, ka inah, chawhnung inher ṭawngṭainaah ka ṭawngṭai a; chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat puon vârtak silin ka hmaah a hung ngîr a,"
"and saith, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.","‘Korneli, i ṭawngṭaina kha hrietin a um tah, mi kuoma i thilpêkhai khawm kha Pathienin a hriet zing ie."
"Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.","Chuleiin, Joppa khuoah mi tir la, Simon Peter an ti chu, i kuomah ko rawh, ama chu tuisuoriet panga savun siemtu Simon ina tlung a nih,’ a ta."
"Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the Lord.","Chuleiin, i kuomah mi ka hung tir nghâl tah a nih; i hung hi a ṭha ie. Chuongchun, Lalpain thu a pêk taphawt che hre dingin tuhin Pathien mithmuin kan rêngin hitaka hin kan um a ni hi,” a ta."
"And Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:",Peter chun a hril a;— “Pathienin mi ditsak bîk a nei nawh ti indiktakin ka hriet;
"but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.","nisienlakhawm, hnam tin lai tû- khawm ama ṭia, feltaka thaw taphawt chu, a lâwm zâwng mi a ni hlak."
"The word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)—","Ama chun thlamuongna Chan- chin Ṭha Isu Krista baua hrilin Israel thlahai kuomah thu ân phur a, (Isu chu mi po po Lal a nih)."
"that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judæa, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;","Johanin a khêkpui hlak baptisma zoa khan, thu, Galili rama inthawkin hung inthang phutin, Juda ram po poa inthang suok kha, nangnîn in hriet bawk annâwm."
"even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.","Nazareth Isu chungchâng thu kha, khânga ama chu Pathienin Thlarau Inthieng le thilthawtheinaa a vurzie kha; ama chun mi chunga thawṭhain le diebol suknawmnat po po sukdamin a fang vêl hlak, Pathien a kuoma a um leiin."
"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.",Juda ram le Jerusalema a thilthawhai po po hretu kan nih; ama chu thinglêra khaiin an sukhlum tah.
"Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,","Pathienin ama chu ni thum niin a keitho nâwk a, fietakin ân entir a,"
"not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.","amiruokchu, mi po po kuomah ni loin, a thu hretu ni dinga inhmaa Pathienin a ithlang tah, keini, mithi laia a thonâwk hnunga a kuoma faa dâwntuhai kuoma hin a nih."
"And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.","Ama chu mithihai le mi hringhai chunga Rorêltua Pathien iruot chu a nih ti, mi kuoma khêkpui le inhriettir dingin Pathienin thu a mi pêk a nih."
"To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.","“Tûkhawm ama ring taphawt chu a hming leiin suolhai ngaidamin um an tih ti hieng a chanchin hi zâwlneihai po poin an inhriettir hlak kha a nih,” a ta."
"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.","Chun, Peterin chuong thu chu a hril lai tak chun, thu hretuhai po po chunga chun Thlarau Inthieng a hung tlung tah a."
"And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Sertanhai laia ringtuhai Peter hung zuituhai chun Thlarau Inthieng pêk chu Jentailhai chunga khawm buok a ni leiin mak an ti hleh a;"
"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,","ṭawng hrietnawhaia thu hrilin, Pathien inpâkin an hriet sih a."
"Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?","Chun, Peterin a biek a, “Hieng mihai, eini anga Thlarau Inthieng hmuhai hi baptisma an chang nawna dingin miin tui hmang an khap thei am a nih?” a ta."
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.,"Chuongchun, Isu Krista hminga baptisma chang ding thu a pêk a. Chuong zoa chun ni iengzat amani lai châm dingin an ngên a."
Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judæa heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.,"Chun, Juda rama tirko le unau umhai chun Jentailhai khawmin Pathien thu an zâwm ti an hriet tah a."
"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,","Chuongchun, Peter chu Jeru- salem a hang tlung phingleh, Sertanhaiin an kal a,"
"saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.","a kuomah, “Sertan nawhai inah i lût a, an kuomah i fâk vei a,” an ta."
"But Peter began, and expounded the matter unto them in order, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin a bula inthawkin indawt zatin an kuomah a hrilfieh a;"
"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me:","“Joppa khuoah ṭawngṭaia ka um laiin zêlin ka um a. Mang angin iengkhat bâwm, puon lientak ang, a ki palia khita, vâna inthawka inkhaithla ka hmuh a; ka kâwla ngei a mi hung hnai a."
"upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.","Chu chu ka en zing a, ka ngai- tuoh a, hnuoia mi sapheimanlihai, ramsahai, thilhringhai le chunga vatehai ka hmuh a."
"And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.","Chun, rawlin, ‘Peter, tho rawh, that la fa rawh,’ mi tiin ka hriet bawk a."
"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.","Nisienlakhawm, keiin, ‘Lalpa, ni lo e, thiengnaw le inthiengnaw ieng- khawm ka bauah a lût ngai nawh,’ ka ta."
"But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.","Nisienlakhawm, vâna inthawka rawl chun a vawi hninaah, ‘Pathienin a sukthieng ta chu nangin inthieng- naw ti naw,’ tiin a mi dawn a."
And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.,"Chuong ang ruok chun vawi thum a hung um a; chun, iengkim chu vâna zuk khaiin a um nâwk tah a."
"And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Cæsarea unto me.","Chun, ngai ta u, mi pathum, Kaisari khuoa inthawkin ka kuomah an hung tir a, ka umna tuola chun an lo um zing tah a."
"And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man’s house:","“Chun, Thlarauin lunghimaw- na nei loa anni zui dingin a mi tir a. Hieng unau parukhai khawm hin an mi zui veh a, mi ina chun kan lût a."
"and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;","Chun, ama chun kan kuomah, a ina vântirko ngîr a hmuzie le, vântirko chun a kuomah, ‘Joppa khuoah mi tir la, Simon, Peter an ti chu, hung inṭhuoitir rawh;"
"who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.","ama chun thu hril a ti cheh a, ama thu lei chun nang le i sûnghai sandamin um in tih,’ a tizie khawm a mi hril a."
"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.","Chun, thu ka hang hril hlimin Thlarau Inthieng ei chunga a hung tlung tir lai ang khan an chungah a hung tlung tah a."
"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Lalpa thu, ‘Johanin tuiin mi a baptis hlak kha, nangni ruok chu Thlarau Inthiengin baptisma la chang in tih,’ a tizie kha ka hung hriet suok nâwk tah a."
"If then God gave unto them the like gift as he did also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?","Chuongchun, Lalpa Isu Krista an ring phingleh, Pathienin thil thlâwnpêk a mi pêk ang kha an kuoma a pêk phawt tahnung chu, kei tê hi Pathien sêl ruol am ka nih?” a ta."
"And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.","Chuong thu chu an hrietin an to tah a, “Chuong a ni chun, Pathienin Jentailhai khawm hring dingin sim a phal tah a ni chu,” tiin Pathien an inpâk tah a."
"They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews.","Chun, Stephan leia an suk- nawmnata indarhai kha, Phoiniki ram dâm, Kupra thlierkâr dâm, Antiokei dâm chenin an feh a, Juda- hai kuoma chau naw chu tu kuoma khawm thu an hril nawh a."
"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.","Nisienlakhawm, anni laia a ṭhen chu Kupra thlierkâr le Kurinia mihai an na, chuonghai chu Antiokei an tlung chun Grikhai kuoma khawm, Lalpa Isu Chanchin Ṭha an hril ve tah a."
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord.,"Chun, Lalpa kutin anni a ṭhangpui a; mi tamtakin an ring a, Lalpa tieng chu an ngha tâwl tah a."
And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch:,"chun, an chanchin chu Jerusalema kohran umhai naa chun a hung lût tah a; chuongchun, Antiokei chen chun Barnaba chu an tir suok tah a."
"who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord:","Chun, ama chu a va tlung a, Pathien lunginsietzie chu a hmu chun a lâwm hleh a; ṭhahnemngai- taka Lalpa chel zing dingin an rêngin ân fui tah a."
"for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.","Barnaba chu mi ṭhatak, Thlarau Inthieng le ringnaa sip a nih. Chun, mi tamtakin Lalpa kuomah an belsa tah a."
And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;,"Chun, Barnaba chu Saula zawng dingin Tarsa khuoah a feh a; chun a hmu chun Antiokeia chun a hung ṭhuoi a."
"and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught much people; and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.","Chun, kum khat zet kohranhai inkhâwmnaa chun an ṭhang ve hlak a, mi tamtak an inchûktir hlak a. Antiokeia chun a nih inchûktirhai chu “Kristien” an ti hmasa tak chu."
Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.,"Chun, chuong lai chun zâwlnei tuhai amanih Jerusalema inthawkin Antiokeia chun an zu feh a."
"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat, a hming Agaba, a ngîr a, khawvêl po poah ṭâm nasatak a tlung ding a ni ti Thlalrau hrilin ân hriettir a; chu ṭâm chu Klaudi inlal laiin a hung tlung tah a."
"And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judæa:","Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chun, an thei tâwk sengin, Judai rama unau umhai kuoma chun sawmdâwlna ding thawn an tum a."
"which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.","Chu chu an thaw ta ngei a, Barnaba le Saula kuta chun upahai kuomah an inphur tah a."
Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.,"Chun, chuong lai vêl chun Lal Herod chun kohrana mi ṭhenkhat suknawmnat tumin a kut ân let tah a."
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.,"Jakob, Johan unau chu, kâwl- hnâmin a sâthlum a."
"And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And those were the days of unleavened bread.","Chu chun Judahai chu a suklâwm ti a hrietin, Peter khawm chu man a tum nâwk pei a. (Chuong nihai chu Chawlṭhanglo Bei ruoiṭhe ni a nih)."
"And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.","chun, a man hnung chun intângna inah a khum a, sipai pâwl li, pali seng peiin, ân vêng sâwktir a; Fekân Ruoiṭhe zoa mi po po kuoma ṭhuoi suok a tum a na."
Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.,"Chuleiin, Peter chu intângna inah ân umtir hrih a; nisienlakhawm, kohranhaiin ama ta dingin ṭha- hnemngaitakin Pathien kuomah an ṭawngṭaipêk hlak a."
"And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.","Chun, Herod chun a ṭhuoi suok tâwmin, chu zân tak chun Peter chu sipai pahni inkârah khaidiet pahni bunin a in a, a vêngtuhai khawm kawtkhâr bulah an um a, intângna in chu an vêng a."
"And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.","Chun, ngai ta, Lalpa vântirko pakhat a kâwlah a hung ngîr a, rip sûnga chun var ieng amanih a hung var a, Peter nâkah a khîk har a, “Tho vak rawh,” a ta. Chun, a khaidiethai chu a kuta chu a tla tah a."
"And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.","Vântirko chun a kuomah, “Dier kei la, i kekawk bun rawh,” a ta. Ama chun chuong ang chun a thawh a. Chun vântirko chun a kuomah, “I puon bât ṭha la, mi zui rawh,” a ta."
"And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.","Peter chu a suok a, a zui tah a; vântirko chângzie chu a tak a ni ti a hriet nawh a, manga a hmu amanih a sâwn lem a."
"And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.","Chun, vêngtu hmasa le a dawttu chu an khêl hnung chun, tuol suokna ding thîr kawtkhâr chu an va tlung a, chu chu an ta dingin ân hawng fâwm tah a; an suok a, kawtthlêr pakhat an khêl a; chun, vântirko chun a fe san nghâl tah a."
"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.","Chun, Peter chu a har phingleh, “Lalpain a vântirko a tir suok a, Herod kut le Juda mihai beiseina po poa inthawkin a mi sandam ti tuhin indiktakin ka hriet tah,” a ta."
"And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.","Chun, ân ngaituo zo chun, Johan, Marka an ti, chu mipa nu Mari ina chun a va feh a; chutaka chun ṭawngṭaiin mi tamtak an lo um khâwm a."
"And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.","Chun, tuolpûk kawtkhâr a hei nawk phingleh, a hming Rodi, nunghâk pakhat, dawn dingin a va feh a."
"And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.","Peter rawl a hriet phingleh, a lâwm leiin kawt chu hawng loin a tlân lût nâwk ta lem a, “Peter chu kawtkhâr bulah a ngîr” tiin a va hril a."
"And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun a kuomah, “în vêt a ni ta hi,” an lo tih a. Ama ruok chu, “Titakzet a nih,” tiin a ṭhang ṭal a. Anni chun, “A vântirko a ni chu,” an ta."
"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chun a nawk zing a; chun, an hei hawng chun, ama chu an hmuh a, mak an ti hleh a."
"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.","Chuongchun, ama chun an tona dingin kutin a zâp a, Pathienin intângna ina inthawka a ṭhuoi suokzie chu a hril tah a. Chun, “Hieng thu hi Jakob le unauhai kuomah va hril ro,” a ta. Chun, a suok a, ram dangah a fe tah a."
"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.","Chun, nisa a suok phingleh, sipaihai chu, “Peter khâwlai am a um tah a?” tiin buoi namênin an buoi nawh a."
"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judæa to Cæsarea, and tarried there.","Herod chun a zawng a, a hmu si nawh a, a vêngtuhai chu a suosal a, sukhlum dingin thu a pêk tah a. Chun, Herod chu Judai rama inthawkin Kaisari khuoah a zu feh a, chutaka chun a um zing a."
"Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king’s country.","Herod chu, Tura le Sidon khuoa mihai chunga chun a lungninaw bêk bêk a. Anni chun, Blasta, lal khum vêngtu chu, an ruolah an siem a, inthuruolin a kuomah an hung a, an khuo tiengin lal khuo tienga pûr inchaw hlak an ni leiin inrem an ngên a."
"And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them.","A ni tiem ni chun, Herod chun lal puon a sil a, lalṭhungphaah a ṭhung a, an kuomah thu a hril a."
"And the people shouted, saying, The voice of a god, and not of a man.","Mi po po chun, “Pathien rawl a ni hi, mihriem rawl a ni naw hi,” an ta, an khêk a."
"And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.","Ama chun Pathien kuomah chawimawina chu a pêk naw leiin Lalpa vântirkoin kârloah a man a, rulrukûtin a fâk a, a thi tah a."
But the word of God grew and multiplied.,"Pathien thu ruok chu, ân dâr a, a pung ta pei a."
"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.","Chun, Barnaba le Saula chun, rawng chu an bâwl zo chun, Jerusalema inthawk chun an kîr nâwk tah a, Johan, Marka an ti chu an kuomah an ṭhuoi veh a."
"Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.","Chun, Antiokeia kohran lai chun thu hriltuhai le inchûktirhai an um; chuong chu Barnaba hai, Simeon Niger an ti hai, Kurini khuoa Lukia hai, lal Herod unau Manaina hai, Saula hai leh an nih."
"And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.","Chun, Lalpa rawng an bâwl a, bu an nghei laiin, Thlarau Inthiengin, “Barnaba le Saula hi anni ka ruot ang san thaw dingin mi suktumpêk ro,” a ta."
"Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.","Chuongchun, bu nghei a, an ṭawngṭai zo chun an chungah kut an innghat a, an infetir tah a."
"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.","Chuongchun, Thlarau Inthieng tir suok chun an fe tah a, Selukai khuoah an fe thlah a, chutaka in- thawkin Kupra thlierkârah lâwngin an feh a."
"And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.","Chun, Salamis khuoa an um laiin, Juda inkhâwmna inahai Pathien thu an hril hlak; Johan khawm kha an rawng bâwl dingin an ṭhuoi veh a."
"And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus;","Chun, thlierkâr chu Paphos chenin an fang suok a, dawithiem zâwlnei tehlêm, Juda mi pakhat an hmuh a, a hming chu Bar-Isu a nih."
"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.","Ama chu, lal aiawtu, Serjia Paula, mi vartak kuoma um a nih. Chu lal aiawtu chun, Barnaba le Saula chu a ko a, Pathien thu hriet a tum a."
"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.","Nisienlakhawm, Elum, (Bar-Isu hming dang umzie hi Dawithiem tina a nih), chu mipa chun, lal aiawtu chu, inringnawtir tumin, anni chu a lo kal a."
"But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,","Chuongchun, Saula, (Paula an ti bawk chu), Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, ama chu a en zing a,"
"and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?","“Nang mi hlêm le theidaum tinrênga sippa, nang diebol naupa, nang felna tinrêng kawp nawpa, Lalpa kawng feltakhai hi suksiet ma naw ti ni maw?"
"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.","Hre rawh, tuhin Lalpa kut i chungah a tla a ni hi, i mit hung indel a ta, khaw var hmu hri naw ti ni,” a ta. Chuongchun, inthim le sûmin ama a baw nghâl tah a, kuta keitu ding zawngin ân vâk a."
"Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.","Chun, Lal aiawtu chun, chuong thil chu a hmuh a, Lalpa inchûktir thu chu mak a ti hleh, a ing tah a."
"Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.","Chun, Paula chu a rawihai le chun, Paphos khuoa inthawk chun lawngin an feh a. Pamphulia rama Perga an tlung a; chun, Johan khan anni chu a mâksan a, Jerusalemah a kîr nâwk tah a."
"But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chu Pergaa inthawkin an fe pei a, Pisidia rama Antiokei an tlung a; chun, Châwlniin inkhâwmna inah an lût a, an ṭhung a."
"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.","Chun, Dân Lekhabu le Zâwl- neihai lekhabu tiem zoin inkhâwmna hotuhaiin an kuomah mi an tir a, “Unauhai, mihai infuina thu ieng amanih in nei chun hril ro,” an ta."
"And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken:","Chun, Paula a ngîr a, kutin a zâp a, a hril a: “Israel mihai le Pathien ṭituhai, ngai ro."
"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.","Hieng Israel chihai Pathien hin, ei thlatuhai a thlang a, Aigupta rama an thang zing lai khan a chawimawi a, kut chunghnungin chutaka inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok tah a."
And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.,Kum sâwmli lai thlalêra khan an thilthawhai chu a en thei zing a.
"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:","Chun, Kanaan rama hnam sari a suktlâwm zo hnung khan an ram chu hluo dingin a pêk pei a, kum zali sâwmnga sûng po khan."
and after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.,"Chuong hnunga chun, rorêltu- hai a pêk hlak a, zâwlnei Samuel chen khan."
"And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.","Chun, chu hnunga chun lal an hnih a; chuongchun, Pathienin Saula, Kis naupa, Benjamin chia mi kha an kuomah a pêk a, kum sâwmli sûnga dingin."
"And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.","Chun, ama chu a sawn hmang hnung khan an lala um dingin David a siem tah a; Pathienin chu thu chu inhriettirin, ‘David, Jessai naupa, ka lungril ang put mi ka hmu suok tah, ama chun ka dit zâwng taphawt thâwng a tih,’ a ta."
"Of this man’s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;","“Chu thlahai laia chun Pathien- in, thutiem ang peiin, Israelhai Sandamtu Isu a hung intlun a."
when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.,A hung hmain Johanin simna baptisma chu Israel mi po po lai a lo hril ta a.
"And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not he. But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.","Chun, Johanin a lampui a hraw suok ding lai chun, ‘Nangnîn tu âm in mi ruot a? Ama chu ka ni nawh ie. Nisienlakhawm, ngai ta u, ka hnungah mi tû amanih a hung ding a nih, kei hi chu a kephaa a kekawk sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh,’ a ta."
"Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.","“Unauhai, Abraham thla nau- hai, nangni laia Pathien ṭi po pohai, eini kuoma hin hieng sandamna thu hi a mi hung inphur suok a ni hi."
"For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.","Jerusalema umhaiin, an hotu- hai leh, ama chu an hriet naw lei le, zâwlneihai thu, Châwlni ta- phawta tiem hlak kha, an hriet bawk naw leiin, ama chu thiemnaw in- changtirin, chu thu chu an hlen tah a."
"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.","A thina khawp meu a chung- ah iengkhawm an hmu naw khawm- in, Pilat kuomah sukhlum an ngên a."
"And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.","Chun, a thu zâwlneihaiin an ziek lâwk po po kha an hlen zo hnungin, thinga inthawk chu an lâk thlâk a, thlânah an inzâl tah a."
But God raised him from the dead:,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin mi- thi laia inthawkin a keitho nâwk tah a."
"and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.","Chun, Galili rama inthawka Jerusalema ama ruola hang fe vehai kuoma chun ni sâwt tak sûngin ân lâr hlak a; chuong mihai chu tuhin mi kuoma a thu hretuhai an nih."
"And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers,","Keini khawmin thlatuhai kuomah thutiem kha a chanchin lâwmum kan hung hril cheu hi,"
"that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.","khânga Pathienin Isu a keitho khan, eini an nauhai lei hin chuong chu a hlen a nih, Inpâkna Hla pa- hninaah, ‘Ka naupa i nih ie, vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih,’ ti ziek ang bawk khan."
"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.","Hmawnna hmuna fe nâwk lo dingin Pathienin ama chu mithi laia inthawkin a keitho dingzie thu chu hieng hin a hril a nih, ‘David kuoma lunginsietna ka itiem tlathai kha nanga kuomah pêng ka che,’ tiin."
"Because he saith also in another psalm, Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption.","Chuleiin, Hla dangin, ‘I Mi In- thieng chu hmawn hmang phal naw ti nih a,’ a ti bawk a."
"For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:","David chu, Pathien rorêlpêk angin a dam ruolpuihai rawng a bâwl zo khan, a in innghil a, a thlatuhai kuomah an inzâl a, a hmawn hmang tah a nih."
but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.,Pathienin a ikeitho ruok kha chu a hmawn hmang naw kha.
"Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:","“Chuongchun, unauhai, hre ro; ama lei chun, suol ngaidamna thu in kuomah hril a ni hi;"
"and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.","tûkhawm ama ring taphawt chu, iengkimah ama thiem inchang- tirin a um, chuonga chun, Mosie Dânin thiem inchangtirin in um thei nawh."
"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:","Chuleiin, fîmkhur ro, chuong naw chun, zâwlneihai lekhabua an hril kha in chungah hung tlung a tih,"
"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your days, A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.","‘Hmusittuhai en ta u, Makti unla, bohmang ro; In dam sûng hin thil kawng khat ka thaw hi, Chu thil chu miin hril hai sienla cheu khawm, Awi tawp naw ti niu,’ a ti kha,” a ta."
"And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.","Chun, an suok chun, Châwlni nâwka chuong thu chu hril nâwk dingin an ngên a."
"Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.","Chun, inkhâwmhai chu an ṭin phingleh, Judahai le an saphun Pathien ngaisak laia mi tamtakin Paula le Barnaba chu an zui pei a; anni chun an lo biek a, Pathien lunginsietnaa chun um zing dingin an infui a."
And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.,"Chun, Châwlni nâwka chun a khuo deu thawin Pathien thu ngai dingin an hung inkhâwm a."
"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin mi- puihai chu an hmu phingleh an îtthîk bêk el a; Paula thu hril chu an sêlkal a, an hrilpâwi hleh a."
"And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.","Chun, Paula le Barnaba chun huoitakin an hril dawk a, “Pathien thu hi nangni kuoma hril hmasak hrim ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, in lo dang kîr a, chatuona hring tlâk loa in inruot ta hnung chu, hre ro, Jentailhai kuom tieng ngha ta vêng kan tih."
"For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.","Chuong ang chun Lalpain thu a mi pêk a nih. ‘Jentailhai sukvartuah ka ruot che, Kâwlkawdawng chena sandamna in tlun theina dingin,’ ti ziek ang khan,” an ta."
"And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.","Chun, Jentailhai chun chuong thu chu an hrietin an lâwm a, Pathien chu an chawimawi a, chun, chatuona hring dinga ruot po chun an ring tah a."
And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.,"Chun, Lalpa thu chu, chu lai ram khawvêla chun ân dar tah a."
"But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahai chun nuhmei inzaum Pathien ngaisakhai le khuoa upahai chu an infui a, Paula le Barnaba chu an insuknawmnatir a, an rama inthawkin an hnawt suok tah a."
"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.","Chun, anni chun an chungah an kephaa pilvut an thinthlâk a, Ikoniom an tlung tah a."
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.,"Chun, închûktirhai chu lâwmna le Thlarau Inthiengin an sip tâwl a."
"And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.","Chun, Ikonioma chun Judahai inkhâwmna inah an lût rêl a, thu an hril hlak a, chuongchun, Grik le Juda tamtak khawmin an ring ta rau a."
"But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.","Nisienlakhawm, ring nuom naw Judahaiin Jentailhai lungril an infui a, unauhai chu an intheidatir a."
"Long time therefore they tarried there speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.","Chuleiin, Lalpa thu huoitaka hrilin chutaka chun sâwt rei an um a, ama chun, inchikna le thilmakhai an kuta inthawtirin, a lunginsiet thu ân hriettir hlak a."
"But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.","Chun, khuoa mipuihai chu an inkhing tah a; aṭhenin Judahai chu an ṭan a; aṭhenin tirkohai chu."
"And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,","Chun, Jentailhai, Judahai, an hotuhai le chun, tirkohai chu inzakumtaka siem le lunga dêng tuma an thaw ding laiin anni chun an lo hriet a,"
"they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about:","Lukaoni ram bawka chun, Lustra le Derbe khuoa le a vêl ramhaia chun an tlân hmang a;"
and there they preached the gospel.,"chuonga chun, Chanchin Ṭha an hril pei a."
"And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.","Chun, Lustraa chun ke zeng tû amanih a ṭhung hlak a, a pieng tîra inthawk keinbai hrim a na, kein a lâwn ngai nawh a."
"The same heard Paul speaking: who, fastening his eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,","Ama chun, Paula thu hril a ngai a, chun, Paula chun, ama chu a en zing a, damna dingin ringna a nei ti a hriet a,"
"said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.","rawl inringtakin, “I kein ngîr tlûn rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chu ân châwm tho a, kein a lâwn tah a."
"And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.","Chun, mipuihaiin Paula thil- thaw chu an hmu phingleh, Lukaoni ṭawngin inringtakin, “Pathienhai chu mihriem angin ei kuomah an hung ṭum tah a ni hi!” an ta."
"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.","Chun, Barnaba chu, “Jupitar” an tih a, Paula chu, thu hriltu lem a ni leiin, “Merkuri” an tih a."
"And the priest of Jupiter whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.","Chun, Jupitar biekin khaw- hnâwma um chu, a thiempu chun sebâwng chalhai le, pâr ṭhihrui limhai, kawtkhâr kâwlah a hung lâk a, mipuihai le chun biekna dingin that an tum a."
"But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out","Nisienlakhawm, tirko Barnaba le Paula chun, chu chu an hriet phing- leh, an puon an keithlêr a, mipui lai chun an inchâwm lût a, an khêk a."
"and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:","“Puhai, iengdinga hieng thilhai hi in thaw am a na? Keini khawm in nungchang ang put mihriem kan ni hi; hieng thil teplohai hi in nghatsan a, vân hai, hnuoi hai, tuisuoriet hai, an sûnga um po pohai siemtu Pathien hring kuoma chun in hung kawpna dingin Chanchin Ṭha kan hung intlun cheu a ni hi."
who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways.,"Chu Pathien chun, tienlaiin hnam tin mâni lampui seng hraw a phal hlak a."
"And yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.","Nisienlakhawm, ama inhriettir- na um loin ân siem ngai nawh. Chuongchun, thil a thaw ṭha hlak a, vâna inthawka ruohai le kum ṭhat kumhai a pêk cheu a, in lungril fâk ding le lâwmnain a suktlaipêk hlak cheu kha,” an ta."
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.,"Chun, chuong thu chun, mipuihaiin anni biekna dinga ran an that ding chu an khap zo hrâm a."
"But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.","Nisienlakhawm, Antiokei le Ikonioma mi Juda tuhai amanih chutaka chun an hung a, mipuihai chu an zâwr thlûk tah a; chuongchun, Paula chu lungin an dêng a, thia an ring leiin khuoa inthawk chu an hnûk dawk tah a."
"But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktirhai chu a vêla an ngîr laiin, a hung tho a, khuoa chun a lût nâwk tah a. Chun, a zînga chun Barnaba leh Derbeah an fe tah a."
"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,","Chu khuohai kuoma chun, Chanchin Ṭha an hril a, inchûktir tamtak an siem hnungin Lustraa hai, Ikonioma hai, Antiokeia hai, an kîr nâwk a."
"confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.","“Rinum tamtak tuorin Pathien ramah ei lût ding a ni hrim a nih,” tiin inchûktirhai lungril an sukdet a, ringnaa chun um zing dingin an infui a."
"And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.","Chun, kohran tinah upahai an ruot pêk pei a, bu nghei puma an ṭawngṭai zoin, an ring Lalpa kuoma chun an inkawltir pei a."
"And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.","Chun, Pisidia ram chu an fang suok a, Pamphulia ram chu an tlung a."
"And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;","Chun, Pergaa thu an hril zoin Attaliaah an zu feh a;"
"and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.","chutaka inthawk chun lawngin an suok a, Antiokei chu an hung tlung nâwk tah a, chu chu a thil thaw zo ta chu thaw dinga unauhaiin Pathien lunginsietna inkawltira an suokna kha a nih."
"And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles.","Chun, an tlung hnungin ko- hranhai chu an ko khâwm a, Pathienin anni hmanga, thil a thawhai po po le, Jentailhai ta dinga ringna kawtkhâr a hawngpêkziehai chu an hril a."
And they tarried no little time with the disciples.,Inchûktirhai lai chun sâwt rei an um tah a.
"And certain men came down from Judæa and taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.","Chun, mi tuhai amanih Judai rama inthawkin an hung thlah a, “Mosie dân anga ser in intantir naw chun sandam ni thei naw ti niu,” tiin unauhai chu an inchûktir a."
"And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, the brethren appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.","Chuongchun, Paula le Barnaba chu anni le chun insêl namêna an insêl nawa an inkhing tlat leiin, Paula le Barnaba chu, anni laia tuhai amani leh, chu thubuoi chunga chun, Jerusalema tirkohai le upahai kuoma hang fe dingin an ruot a."
"They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.","Chuongchun, kohran chun an hang inthlah a, anni chun Jentailhai nghat kîr nâwkzie thu chu hril peiin Phoiniki ram le Samari ram an fang suok tah a; chuongchun, unauhai po po an suklâwm bêk bêk a."
"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.","Chun, Jerusalem chu an hang tlung chun, kohranhai, tirkohai, upahai chun an lo lâwm a, chun, Pathienin anni hmanga thil a thaw- hai po po chu an hril a."
"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharisai pâwl, ring ve tuhai amanih an tho a, “Jentailhai ser tan ding a nih. Mosie dân zâwm khawm anni chu tiem kher ding a nih,” an ta."
And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.,"Chun, tirkohai le upahai chu, chu thu chu ngaituo dingin an inkhâwm a."
"And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.","Chun, an insêl rak hnungin Peter a tho a, an kuomah, “Unauhai, Jentailhaiin keia baua Chanchin Ṭha thu hrea awi dingin, Pathienin inhmaa nangni laia inthawka a mi ruotzie kha in hriet."
"And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;","Chun, lungril hretu Pathienin eini a mi pêk ang bawk khan, Thlarau Inthieng an kuoma pe vein, an chungah a lâwm ti ân hriettir a;"
"and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.","chun, anni le eini thlier bîk loin, ringnain an lungril a sukthieng tah a."
"Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?","Chuongchun, ei thlatuhai le eini izo ta naw, rîngkawl kha inchûktirhai chungah tuhin innghat tumin ieng- dinga Pathien var in sêlkal am a na?"
"But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.","Anni ring ang bawkin eini khawmin Lalpa Isu lunginsietna leia sandam ding niin ei ring sih a,” a ta."
And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.,"Chuongchun, mipui po po an to zing a, Barnaba le Paula Pa- thienin anni hmanga Jentailhai laia inchiknahai le thilmakhai a thaw thu kha an hril sûng po chu an ngai a."
"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:","Chun, an hril zoin Jakobin a hril ve thung a; “Unauhai, ka thu lo ngai ta u,"
"Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.","Pathienin ama hming put dingin, anni laia mihai la suok dingin Jentailhai a hung kan tîr thu kha, Simeon hin a hril tah."
"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,","Chun, chuong thu le zâwlneihai thu hi ân hme a nih:"
"After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:","‘Chuong zoa chun kîr nâwk ka ta David bâwktê chim kha siem nâwk ka tih, A sietna lai po khawm siem ṭha nâwk ka ta;"
"That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,","Mi dang, Jentailhai po po ka hming mîn ṭawmpuihai chun, Lalpa an zawngna dingin Chu bâwktê chu tungding ka tih, tiin,"
"Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.","Khawvêl siem tîra inthawkin hieng thu inhriettir hlaktu Lalpa chun a tih,’ ti ziek ang khan."
"Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;","“Chuleiin, hieng ang hin ka ruot a nih. Jentailhai laia Pathien tieng nghahai chu sukrinum naw inla,"
"but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.","milim biekna thil inthiengnaw fâk dâm, indit dâm, sa râkhlum le thisen fâk dâm bân dingin an kuomah ziek lem inla ka ti tak a nih."
"For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.","Mosien inhmaa inthawk tah khaw tinah a thu khêkpuitu a nei hlak sih a; inkhâwmna inahai Châwlni taphawt chun a thu chu tiem a ni hlak kha,” a ta."
"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:","Chun, tirkohai, upahai kohran po pohai le chun, an pâwla mi thlanga, Paula le Barnaba ruolin Antiokeia infetir ṭha an tih a; an ithlanghai hming chu Juda (Barsaba an ti) le, Sila an nih; anni chu unauhai laia hotu deu an nih."
"and they wrote thus by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:","Chun, hieng ang hin an ziek a, an kutah an inphur a; “Tirkohai le unauhai laia upahaiin Antiokeia dâm, Suria rama dâm le Kilikia rama Jentail unau umhai chibai an bûk."
"Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;","“Kan pâwl laia mi tuhai amaniin thu hrilin an sukbuoi cheu a, in lungril an suklungzîng ti kan hriet a, an kuomah thu iengkhawm kan pêk si nawh."
"it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,","Chuleiin, inthuruola kan in- khâwmin, kan dittak Barnaba le Paula,"
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.,"Lalpa Isu Krista hming leia thi dâwnlohai hung ruol hin, mi thlanga in kuoma hung tir ve ṭhain kan hriet a."
"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.","Chuongchun, Juda le Sila kan hung tir a ni hi, anni khawmin hieng thu bawk hi ṭawng bauin hril an ti cheu."
"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:","Thlarau Inthieng le keinîn, hieng thu pawimaw naw hi chu phur rik zuol in chungah innghat naw inla, a ṭha kan tih;"
"that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.","milim biekna sa fâk dâm, indit dâm ma unla kan tih. Hieng hi in ma chun in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih. Damtakin um ro,” tiin."
"So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.","Chuongchun, an itir chun an feh a, Antiokei chu an zu tlung a. Mipui chu an ko khâwm a, lekha chu an pêk a."
"And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.","Chun, an tiem zoin thlamuong- na thu lei chun an lâwm ta hleh a."
"And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.","Chun, Juda le Sila chu zâwlnei an ni bawk a, thu tamtakin unauhai chu an thlamuon a, an sukdet a."
"And after they had spent some time there, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.","Chun, chutaka chun sâwt rei an um hnungin, anni hung tirtuhai kuomah kîr nâwk dingin unauhai chun thlamuongtakin an infetir nâwk tah a,"
,(Sila ruok chu chutaka um zing a tum a.)
"But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.","Paula le Barnaba ruok chu Antiokeia chun Lalpa thu inchûktir le hrilin an um zing a, mi dang tamtakhai leh."
"And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they fare.","Chun, ni iengzat amanih hnunga chun, Paulain Barnaba kuomah, “Tuhin fe nâwk inla, khaw tina Lalpa thu ei hrilna taphawta unau umhai kha kan pei inla, an um dân en ei tih,” a ta."
"And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.","Chun, Barnaba chun Johan, (Marka an ti chu), an kuoma ṭhuoi ve a tum a, Paula ruok chun, ama chu an kuoma ṭhuoi chu ṭha a ti nawh a."
"But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.","Pamphulia ramah anni a kîr san a, sinthawnaa an kuoma a fe ve ta naw lei khan."
"And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus:","Chuongchun, nasatakin an lo insêl tah a, an inṭheh a, Barnaba chun, Marka chu a kuomah a ṭhuoi a, Kupra thlierkâr tieng lawngin a fe tah a."
"but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.","Paula ruok chun, Sila a thlang a, unauhaiin Lalpa lunginsietna an inkawltir hnungin a fe suok tah a."
"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.","Chun, kohranhai chu sukdet peiin Suria le Kilikia ram a fang suok tah a."
"And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.","Chun, Derbe le Lustraa chun a fe bawk a; chun, chutaka chun, a hming Timothe inchûktir pakhat a um; ama chu ringtu Juda nuhmei naupa a na, a pa ruok chu Grik a nih;"
The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.,"Lustra le Ikonioma unau umhai chun, ama chu an inpâk hlak a."
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.,"Paulain ama chu a kuoma fe ve dingin a dit a; chuongchun, chu tienga Juda umhai lei chun, a ser a tanpêk a, a pa chu Grik a nih ti an hriet vawng sih a."
"And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.","Chun, khaw tinah an fe malamin Jerusalema tirko le upa umhai thurêl kha zâwm dingin unauhai kuomah an pêk pei a."
"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.","Chuongchun, kohranhai chu ringnaa chun an det tah a, ni tin an pung ta deu deu a."
"And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;","Chun, Thlarau Inthiengin Asia rama thu hril a khap leiin Phrugia le Galati ram chu an fang suok a;"
"and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;","chun, Musia ram kâwl an tlungin Bethunia ramah lût an tum a, nisienlakhawm, Isu Thlarauin a phal si nawh."
"and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.","Chuongchun, Musia ram chu an khêl a, Troasah an fe thla tah a."
"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.","Chun, zânah Paulain a mang angin Makedonia rama mi mi pakhat ngîrin, “Makedonia ramah hung kai la, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” tia ngên ngênin a hmuh a."
"And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel unto them.","Chun, chu mang chu a mang zo phingleh, Makedonia rama chun fe kan tum tah a, an kuoma Chanchin Ṭha hril dingin Pathienin a mi ko ti kan hriet a."
"Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;","Chun, Troasa inthawk chun lawngin kan suok a, tluongtakin Samotrakiah kan riek a, a zînga chun Neapoliah kan fe nâwk a;"
"and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.","chun, chutaka inthawk chun Philippiah kan feh a, chu khuo chu Makedonia rama khaw pakhat a nih, chu biela chun khaw pawimaw tak a na, Roma inthawka mi inpêmhai khuo a nih. Chu khuoa chun ni tam rei kan châm a."
"And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.","Chun, Châwlniin kul kawtkhâr puo tienga vadung panga, ṭawng- ṭaina hmun ni dinga kan ringa chun kan feh a; chun, kan ṭhunga nuhmei hung khâwmhai kuoma chun thu kan hril a."
"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.","Chun, a hming Luda, puon senduk zawrtu, Thuotira khuoa mi, Pathien betu nuhmei pakhatin kan thu a hriet a; chun Paula thu hril zâwm dingin Lalpa chun a lungril a sukvar tah a."
"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.","Chun, ama le a sûnghaiin baptisma an chang zo chun, “Lalpa ring tak zeta in mi ruot chun, ka inah hung tlung ro,” tiin a mi ngên a mi ngên a, a mi chel tah a."
"And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.","Chun, ṭawngṭaina hmuna kan fe lai chun suok nunghâk tû amanih, khawhri aisânthiem zâwlin a mîn tuokpui a, ama chun a aisân lei chun a puhai chu sum tamtak ân hmutir hlak a."
"The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.","Ama chun Paula le keini a mi zui a, “Hienghai, sandamna lampui hriltu cheu hi, Achunghnungtak Pathien suokhai an ni hi,” tiin a khêk a."
"And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.","Chuong ang chun, ni sâwt rei a thaw hlak a. Chuongchun, Paula chu a lungni ta nawh a, a nghah a, khawhri kuoma chun, “Isu Krista hmingin a sûnga inthawkin suok thu ka pêk che,” a ta. Chun, chu lai tak chun a suok nghâl tah a."
"But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,","Chun, a puhai chun an sum hmuna ân hmang ti an hriet a, Paula le Sila chu an man a, hotuhai hmaah dâwr hmunah an kei lût a."
"and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,","Chuongchun, thu rêltuhai kuomah an ṭhuoi a, “Hienghai hi Judahai an na, kan khuo an sukbuoi bêk bêk a,"
"and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.","dân kan pawm thiengnaw le kan zâwm thiengnaw dâm an hril a, Rom mi kan ni sih a,” an ta."
"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.","Chuongchun, mipuihai khawm chu tirkohai thaw ding chun an hung inthawk veh a, thu rêltuhai chun an puonhai an the thlâkpêk a, hmawla vuok thu an pêk a."
"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:","Chun, vawi tamtak an vuok zoin intângna inah an khum a, a vêngtu kuomah himtaka vêng ding an ti tlat a."
"who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.","Chuong ang lâwma thu an pêk leiin rip sûngrilah a khum a, an kehaia chun thing kawl ân buntir a."
"But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;","Nisienlakhawm, zân rila chun, Paula le Sila chu Pathien kuomah an ṭawngṭai a, hla an sak a, intânghai chun an ngai a;"
"and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every one’s bands were loosed.","chun, kârloin simkhawleihnuoi nasatakin a hung inhnîng a; chun, kawtkhâr po po chu ân hawng nghâl a, mi tin kawl bunhai chu a hung insût vawng tah a."
"And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.","Chun, a vêngtu a ininnghil chu a hung har a, intângna in kawt- khârhai chu inhawngin a hmuh a, intânghai chu an tlân hmang amanih a ta, kâwlhnâm a phawi a, insukhlum a tum a."
"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chu rawl inringtakin a khêk a, “Iengkhawm inlaw naw, kan rêngin hitaka hin kan la um vawng annâwm,” a ta."
"And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,","Chun, a vêngtu chun khâwn- varhai a lam a, ân châwm lût a, ṭia inthin pumin Paula le Sila hmaah a bawkkhup a."
"and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?","Anni chu a ṭhuoi suok a, “Puhai, sandama um dingin ieng am ka thaw ding?” a ta."
"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.","Chun, anni chun, “Lalpa Isu ring la, chuongchun, sandamin um i tih, nang le i sûnghai leh,” an ta."
"And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.","Chun, a kuoma le a ina um po pohai kuoma chun Pathien thu an hril a."
"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.","Chu zân chun, chu lai le le chun, a ṭhuoi a, an vuokna invuolhai chu a sâwpfai a; chun, ama le a sûnghai po po chun baptisma an chang nghâl tah a."
"And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.","Chun, a inah a hang ṭhuoi a, fâk ding a pêk a, chun, Pathien an ring leiin, ama chu, a sûnghai po po le chun an hlim ta bêk bêk a."
"But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.","Chun, nisa a suok chun rorêltuhai chun, “Kha hai kha insuo rawh,” ti dingin manmihai an tir a."
"And the jailor reported the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.","Chun, intângna in vêngtu chun, Paula kuomah an thu a hril a, “Rorêltuhai chun insuo ding cheuin mi an hung tir a; chuleiin, tuhin hung suok unla, thlamuongtakin fe ro,” a ta."
"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chun an kuomah, “Rom mi kan ni sih a, kan thiem le kan thiem naw hre loin vântlâng mithmuin an mi vuok a, intângna inah an mi khum a; tuhin inrûkin an mi hnawt suok vei ding a ni maw? Ni der naw ni; anni ngei hung hai sienla mi hung ṭhuoi suok raw hai se,” a ta."
And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;,"Chuongchun, manmihai chun, chuong thu chu rorêltuhai kuoma chun an hril a. Chun, Rom mi an nih ti an hriet chun an ṭi tah a."
"and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.","An va feh a, an thlêm a, an ṭhuoi suok a, khuoa inthawk chun fe hmang dingin an ngên a."
"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.","Chun, intângna ina inthawk chun an suok a, Luda ina chun an lût a; chun, unauhai chu an hmuh a, an thlamuon a, an suok tah a."
"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:","Chun, Amphipoli le Apollonia an khêl a, Thessalonika an tlung tah a; chutaka chun Judahai inkhâwmna in a um a."
"and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures,","Chun, Paula, a dân pângngaiin, an kuomah a lût a, Châwlni vawi thum Pathien Lekha Thua inthawkin nguntakin a suipui a,"
"opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.","Krista chu rinum tuor ding a ni hrimzie dâm, mithi laia inthawka thonâwk ding a ni hrimzie dâm a hrilfieh a; a suklang hlak a, “Hi Isu a thu ka hril cheu hi, ama chu Krista a nih,” a ti bawk hlak a."
"And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.","Chuongchun, anni laia ṭhenkhat chu zâwrthlûkin an um tah a, Paula le Sila chu an pâwl tah a; Pathien ngaisak Grik mipui nasatak le nuhmei ṭhuoitu tamtak leh."
"But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin an huphur a; dâwr hmuna mi suol thabo tuhai amanih an kuomah an ṭhuoi a, mipui an ko khâwm a, khuo po po chu an chawkbuoi a, Jason in an hung ṭhâwng a, vântlâng laia ṭhuoi suok tumin."
"And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;","Chun, anni chu an hmu nawh a, Jason le unau dang tuhai amanih khaw hotuhai kuomah an kei lût a, an khêk a, “Khawvêl chawk- buoituhai kha hitaka khawm hin an hung a,"
"whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.","Jason hin a lo intlungtir vei a; hienghai po po hi, ‘A hming Isu, lal dang a um,’ tiin Kaisar thu kalin an um hlak a nih,” an ta."
"And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.","Chun, mipui le khaw hotuhai chun chuong thu chu an hang hriet chun an buoi tah a;"
"And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.","chun, Jason le unau danghai kuoma inthawka an aia hrên ding iengkhat an lâk a, an insuo tah a."
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.,"Chun, unauhai chun a zân a zânin Paula le Sila chu Beroia khuoah an infetir nghâl tah a; chutaka an va tlung chun, Judahai inkhâwmna inah an lût a."
"Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the scriptures daily, whether these things were so.","Chutaka mihai chu Thes- salonika mihai nêk chun an lo ṭha lem a, chuongchun, lungril lâwmtakin thu chu an pawm a, an thu hril chu ân dik le ân dik naw hrietna dingin ni tin Pathien Lekhaah an zawng hlak a."
"Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.","Chuongchun, chuong mihai tamtak chun an ring tah a; Grik nuhmei inzaumhai le pasalhai khawmin duoiin an ring ta nawh a."
"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.","Nisienlakhawm, Thessalonikaa Judahai chun Paulain Beroia khuoah Pathien thu a hril ti an hriet phingleh, chutaka khawm chun an va feh a, mipuihai an infui a, an buoi nâwk tah a."
And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.,"Chuongchun, unauhaiin tuisuo- riet chena fe dingin Paula chu an tir suok tah a, Sila le Timothe ruok chu chutaka chun an la um zing a."
"But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.","Chun, Paula ṭhuoituhai chun Atheni chenin an ṭhuoi a; chun, Sila le Timothe chu inhmawtaka a kuoma fe vakna ding thu incha chu phurin an kîr tah a."
"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.","Chun, Paulain Atheniah anni chu a lo nghâk laiin, khuo chu Pathien lima sipin a hmuh a, a lungril a helkam tah a."
"So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.","Chuongchun, inkhâwmna inah Judahai le Pathien ngaisakhai a sêl hlak a, dâwr hmuna dâm khawm, chutaka hung um taphawthai chu ni tin a lo sêl bawk hlak a."
"And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.","Chun, Epikuria mi le Stoik mi laia mi var tuhai amanih khawmin ama chu an hung sêl a, a ṭhenin, “Hi mipa bautam hin ieng am hril a tum a?” an ta. A ṭhenin, (Isu thu le thonâwkna thu a hril leiin,) “Ram dang pathienhai thu hriltu a ni âwm ie,” an ta."
"And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?","Chun, ama chu an chel a, Areopagia chun an hung ṭhuoi a, a kuomah, “Hi inchûktirna thar i hril hlak hi mîn hriettir thei i ti?"
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.,"Thilmak ieng amanih kan naah i hung intlun a nih; chuleiin, hieng thil umzie hi hriet kan nuom,” an ta."
"(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)","(Athenia mi po po chu, an khuoa mikhuol umhai khawm, an inhman chang taphawt chu thu thar chu hrilin amanih, ngaiin amani bêk an um zing hlak hrim a na)."
"And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very religious.","Chun, Paula chu Areopagi lai taka chun a ngîr a, a hril a, “Nangni Athenia mihai, iengkimah sakhaw ngaisaktak mi in ni ti ka hriet a."
"For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.","Ka lêng malama, chibai in ibûkhai ka en laiin, mâichâm pakhat, a chungah, ‘HRIET NAW PATHIEN TA DING,’ tia ziek ka hmu a nih. Chuongchun, hre loa chibai in ibûk hlak kha, ama thu chu ka hril cheu a ni hi."
"The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;","Pathien, khawvêl le a sûnga thil po po siemtu chu, hnuoi le vân lal a ni leiin, kuta bâwl inhaiah a um nawh."
"neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;","Thil tlasam angin mihriem kuta rawngbâwlpêkin a um bawk nawh. Ama ngei chu iengkim kuoma hringnahai, inthuoknahai, le thil po po petu chu a ni lem."
"and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;","Chun, hnuoi chung po poa um dingin, bul hmunkhatin hnam tin mi a siem a. An ta dingin hun bihai a ruot a, an umna rihai khawm a khang pêk a;"
"that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:","Pathien an zawng a, an dap an dap a, an hmu hrâmna dingin; nisienlakhawm, ama chun a mi hlat naw seng si."
"for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.","Ama leiin, ei hring, ei châng, ei um a ni sih a; nangni hlaphuokthiem tuhai amani khawmin, ‘Eini khawm a thlahai ei nih,’ tia an hril ang khan."
"Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.","Chuongchun, Pathien thlahai ei ni hnung chu, Pathien pangti chu, rângkachak dâm, tangka dâm, lung dâm, mihriem themthiem le remruot- a suthai ang hi amanih ei ti ding a ni nawh."
The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:,"Chuongchun, Pathienin ei hriet naw laihai kha hriet naw tehlêm a thaw hlak a; nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu ram tina mi po po sim ding thu a pêk tah a nih, ni a tiem leiin;"
"inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.","chu ni chun, a mi ruot chu, hnuoia mihai ro feltakin inrêltir a tih. Chu thu chu, Pathienin ama chu mithi laia inthawka a keithona chun, mi po po kuomah ân hriettir tah a nih,” tiin."
"Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.","Chun, mithi laia inthawka thonâwkna thu chu an hriet phingleh a ṭhenin an nuisan a; a ṭhenin, “Hi thu hi i kuomah la ngai nâwk kan tih,” an ta."
Thus Paul went out from among them.,"Chuongchun, Paula chu anni laia inthawkin a suok tah a."
"But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.","Nisienlakhawm, mi tuhai ama- nih a kuomah an ṭhang ta tlat a, an ring tah a; anni laia ṭhenkhathai chu Areopagia rorêltu pâwla mi Dionusia le, nuhmei pakhat a hming, Damari le, an kuoma mi danghai le chun an nih."
"After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.","Chuong thil hnunga chun Paula chu Athenia inthawk chu a suok a, Korinthah a fe tah a."
"And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;","Chun, a hming Akuila, Juda pakhat a hmuh a, ama chu Ponto rama pieng a nih; Klaudiin Juda po po Roma inthawka suok thu a pêk leiin a nuhmei Priskilla leh Itali rama inthawka hung hlim an nih."
"and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought; for by their trade they were tentmakers.","Chun, Paula chu anni ina chun a tlung tah a; chun, an sinthaw ang thaw a ni leiin anni a hrawn a, an kuomah a thaw ve hlak a; an sinthaw chu puon in siem a nih."
"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.","Châwlni po leh inkhâwmna inah ṭhahnemngaitakin thu a hril hlak a, Judahai le Grikhai chu thlêmthlûk a tum hlak a."
"But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.","Chun, Sila le Timothe chu Makedonia rama inthawka an hung thla chun, Paula chu thu hril chauin a um tah a, Isu kha Krista a nih ti Judahai chu a hrilfie a. Nisien- lakhawm, an kalin an hrilpâwi a,"
"And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.","Paulân a puon a thin a, an kuomah, “In thina maw chu nangnîn phur ro, kei chu ka hul a nih, tuta chen chu Jentailhai lai fe tâng ka tih,” a ta."
"And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun a feh a, a hming Tita Justa mi pakhat inah a lût a, ama chun Pathien a biek hlak a; a in khawm chu inkhâwmna in le inzawm a nih."
"And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.","Chun, Krispa, inkhâwmna hotu chun, a sûnghai po po leh Lalpa an ring a, Korinth khuoa mi tamtak khawmin an hriet a, an ring a, baptisma an chang tah a."
"And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:","Chun, zânah Lalpain Paula kuoma chun mang angin, “Ṭi naw la, to loin thu hril pei rawh,"
"for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.","kei i kuomah ka um annâwm, sukna ding chein tukhawmin i chungah kut thlâk naw ni hai; hi khuoa hin mi tamtak ka nei sih a,” a ta."
"And he dwelt there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","Chun, Paula chu chutaka chun, an kuomah Pathien thu inchûktirin kum khat le thla ruk a um a."
"But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,","Chun, Gallio, Akaia rama lal aiawa a um laiin Judahaiin inthu- ruolin Paula an thaw a, rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaah an ṭhuoi a,"
"saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.","“Hi mipa hrep hin Dân naw anga Pathien be dingin mi a thlêm- thlûk hlak a nih,” an ta."
"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:","Chun, Paulain a dawn tâwmin, Gallio chun Judahai kuomah, “Judahai, hieng hi thil indiknaw thu amanih bêk ni sienla, matheiloin ngaisak ka ti cheu a;"
"but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.","nisienlakhawm, thuhai, hming- hai, nangni dân chung thuhai mei mei a ni chun, nangnîn rêl lem ro; kei chu chuong ang thu chu ngaituo ka nuom nawh ie,” a ta."
And he drove them from the judgment-seat.,"Chun, rorêlna ṭhungphaa in- thawk chun anni chu a hnawt hmang tah a."
"And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.","Chun, Grik mihai po poin inkhâwmna in hotu Sosthen an man a, rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaa chun an vuok a. Gallio chun chuong an thilthaw chu ienga khawm a ngai nawh."
"And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreæ; for he had a vow.","Chun, chu hnunga chun, Paula chu ni sâwttak a la châm zing a; chu zoa chun, unauhai chu ṭawng- bauṭhain a ṭheh a, chutaka inthawk chu Suria ram tieng lawngin a fe tah a, a kuomah Priskilla le Akuila chu an fe ve bawk a; Paulain thutiem a nei leiin Kenkrieiah a lu a vâw zet a."
"And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.","Chun, Ephesi chu an tlung a, chutaka chun anni chu a mâksan tah a; ama ruok chu inkhâwmna inah a lût a, Judahai kuomah ṭhahnem- ngaitakin thu a hril hrih a."
"And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;","Chun, sâwt deu châm dingin an ngên a, nisienlakhawm, a remti nawh a,"
"but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.","“Pathienin a phal chun, in kuomah la hung nâwk ka tih,” tiin ṭawngbauṭhain a ṭheh a; Ephesia inthawk chu lawngin a fe tah a."
"And when he had landed at Cæsarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.","Chun, lawnga inthawk chu Kaisariah a suok a, Jerusalemah a hang feh a, kohranhai chu chibai a bûk a; chun, chu zoa chun, Antiokeiah a zu fe tah a."
"And having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.","Chun, chutaka chun sâwt rei a um hnungin, a fe nâwk a, inchûktir- hai po po sukdetin Galati ram le Phru- gia ram chu a fang suok vawng a."
"Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.","Chun, Juda pakhat a hming Apollo, Alexandria khuoa pieng, thuhril theitak, Ephesia chun a zu feh a; ama chun Pathien Lekha thuhai a hriet nasa bêk bêk a."
"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:","Ama chu Lalpa Lam thu in- chûktir tah a na, lungrila ṭhahnem- ngaitak a ni leiin Isu chanchin nguntakin a hril a, ân chuktir hlak a, Johan baptisma thu chau a hriet sih a."
"and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.","Chun, inkhâwmna inah huoi- takin thu a hril phut tah a. Chuongchun, Priskilla le Akuila chun a thu hril an hrietin; an inah an ṭhuoi a, a kuomah Pathien Lam thu fel nâwk zuolin an hrilfie tah a."
"And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;","Chun, ama chun Akaia rama fe kai a tum phingleh unauhaiin an infui a, ama an lo lâwmna dingin inchûktirhai kuomah lekha an ziekpêk a. Chun, a tlung chun, Pathien lunginsietna leia ringtuhai chu nasatakin a ṭhangpui a."
"for he powerfully confuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.","Vantlâng hrietin Judahai chu nasatakin a sêldawng a, Pathien Lekha Thu hmangin Isu kha Krista chu a nih ti ân hriettir hlak a."
"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:","Chun, Paula chu khaw sak biel a fang suok zet a, Apollo Korintha a um kâr khan Ephesi chu a tlung a, inchûktir tuhai amanih a hmuh a;"
"and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was given.","chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In ring tîr lai khan Thlarau Inthieng in chang am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Chang lo, Thlarau Inthieng a um ti khawm kan hriet nawh,” an ta."
"And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.","Ama chun, “Ieng baptisma am in chang a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Johan baptisma,” an ta."
"And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.","Chun, Paula chun, “Johan khan chu mi kuomah, ‘A mi hung zuitu ding, (Isu chu) in la ring ding a nih,’ tiin simna baptismain a baptis hlak a ni kha,” a ta."
"And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.","Chu thu chu an hriet phingleh, Lalpa Isu hmingin baptisma an chang tah a."
"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.","Chun, Paulain an chungah a kut ân nghat a, Thlarau Inthieng chu an chungah a hung tlung tah a; chuong- chun ṭawng hrietnaw haiin thu an hril a, Pathien thu khawm an hril tah a."
And they were in all about twelve men.,An rêng chun patling sâwm le pahni lai an nih.
"And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of God.","Chun, Paula chu inkhâwmna inah a lût hlak a, thla thum lai huoitakin thu a hril a, Pathien ram kawng thua chun a sêl a, mi a thlêmthlûk hlak a."
"But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen chu an kawmaw a, an awi nuom nawh a, mipui hmaah Lam thu chu an hrilsiet phingleh, ama chun anni a fe san a, inchûktirhai chu a kei hran a, ni tin Turanna inchûktirnaah a sêl hlak a."
"And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.","Chuong ang ruok chun kum hni lai a thawh a; chuongchun, Asia rama um po po, Judahai le Grikhai khawm- in, Lalpa thu chu an hriet ta rau a."
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:,"Chun, Pathienin Paula kutin thilmak namên ân thawtir nawh a."
"insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.","Chuongchun, a taksaa in- thawka inhrûkna puonhai amanih, fênthuohai amanih damnawhai kuomah an hung chawi a, an natna- hai a bo hlak a, an sûnga inthawkin khawhrihai khawm an suok hlak a."
"But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.","Chun, Juda invai, thieminzawr tuhaiin amanih, “Paulain a thu a ikhêkpui hlak Isu hmingin kan vau che,” tiin khawhri vawnhai chung- ah Lalpa Isu hming an lam hlak a."
"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.","Chun, Juda mi, thiempu lal pakhat, Skeva chun chuong ang thaw ve hlak naupasal pasari a nei a."
"And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?","Nisienlakhawm, khawhri chun an kuomah, “Isu ka awi, Paula khawm ka hriet, nangni ruok chu tuhai am in ni leh?” a ta, a dawn a."
"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","Chun, khawhri vawn chun a hung bawh a, an pahni chun a hneh a, a ngam ta lem a, chuongchun, chu ina inthawk chun ruok le hliemin an tlân suok ta rau a."
"And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.","Chuongchun, Ephesia um po po, Judahai le Grikhai kuoma chun, chu thu chu ân thang tah a. Chuongchun, an rêngin an ṭih a, Lalpa Isu hming a lien tah a."
"Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.","Chun, ringnawhai khawm chu a ṭhen tamtak an hung a, an thilthaw- hai thupha an chawi a, an inphuong tah a."
"And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.","Dawihmang a ṭhen tamtak khawmin an lekhabuhai an hung chawi khâwm a, mi po po mithmuah an raw tah a; chun a man an sût a, tangka sîng nga niin an hriet."
So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.,"Chuong ang lâwma nasa chun Lalpa thu chu ân dar a, a hne ta pei a."
"Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.","Chun, chuong zoa chun Paulain, Makedonia ram le Akaia ram chu fang suok phawt a, Jerusalema fe a lungril a, “Chutaka ka fe zo chun Rom ka sir bawk ding a nih,” a ta."
"And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.","Chuongchun, a ṭhangpuitu pahni, Timothe le Erasta chu, Make- doniaah ân fetir zet a, ama ruok chu Asia ramah a um hrih a."
And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.,"Chun, chuong lai vêl chun Lam thu lei chun mi buoi namênin an buoi ta nawh a."
"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;","Mi pakhat a hming Demetria, tangkaruo suttu, tangkaruoa Diana biekna in siemtu chun, a siemthiem- hai kuomah inhlawna tamtak a pêk hlak a."
"whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.","Ama chun anni chu a ko khâwm a, an sinthaw ang thawtuhai leh; chun, an kuomah, “Puhai, hi sin hi ei hausakna a nih ti in hriet."
"And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:","Hitaka Ephesi chaua hin ni loin Asia ram khawvêl po po deu thawa khawm, hi Paula hin, ‘Kuta siem pathienhai hi Pathien an ni nawh,’ tiin mi tamtak a thlêmthlûk a, ân kaitir zo tah ti nangni ngeiin in hmuin in hriet bawk a."
"and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.","Chuongchun, ei sinthaw lân a tih ti chau khawm hi ni loin, pathiennu ropuitak Diana biekin khawm hi hung ngaitlâwm an ta, Asia rama mi po po le khawvêla miin an biek hlak hi, a ropui vei leh, tlâwm a tih ti ṭi a um bawk a nih,” a ta."
"And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Chun, chuong thu chu an hriet phingleh an lunginsen ta bêk bêk a, “Ephesia mi Diana hi ropuitak a nih!” tiin an khêk a."
"And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.","Chuongchun, a khuoin an buoi tah a, Gaia le Aristarka, Makedonia rama mi, Paula hnungzuituhai chu an man a, inthuruolin ennuom siemna inah an tlânpui a."
"And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.","Chun, Paulain mipui lai lût a tum chun, inchûktirhai chun an phal nawh a."
"And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.","Chun, Asia rama hotutakhai laia ṭhenkhat tuhai amanih Paula ruolhai an na, a kuomah mi an tir a, ennuom siemna ina chun lût ṭâl lo dingin an ngên a."
"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.","Chun, umkhâwmhai chu an buoi a, mi tam lem chun an inkhâwmna san khawm an hriet nawh a, chuleiin ṭhenkhat thu pakhatin an khêk a, ṭhenkhat thu dangin an khêk a."
"And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defence unto the people.","Chun, mipui laia mi ṭhenkhatin an thiemna thu hril dân ding chu Alexandra an hril a, Judahaiin ama chu mi hma tieng chun an nam lût a, Alexandra chun a kutin a zâp a, mi po po kuoma chun an thiemna thu hril a tum a."
"But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu Juda mi a nih ti an hriet phingleh, dârkâr hni lai, rawl inruoltakin, “Ephesia mi Diana hi ropuitak a nih” ti ruokin an khêk a."
"And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?","Chun, khaw lekhaziektuin mi- pui chu a vaudei zo chun, “Ephesia mihai, Diana ropuitak biekin le vâna inthawka milim tla kha, Ephesia mihai hi a vêngtu in ni ti, tû am a hre naw an um a?"
"Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.","Chuongchun, hieng thu hi sêl ruol a ni naw hnung chun in to zing ding a nih, thu dâwn loin iengkhawm in thaw ding a ni nawh."
"For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.","Hieng mihai hitaka in hung ṭhuoihai hi, biekin suomhmanghai an ni nawh a, ei pathiennu hrilsetu hlak an ni bawk nawh."
"If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.","Chuongchun, Demetria le a ruol themthiemhai khawmin tû chunga khawm thupawi an nei chun thupawi hrilna inhai chu hawng zing a nih annâwm, lal aiawtuhai khawm an um a; insâl raw se."
"But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.",Thil dang pawi hrim nei in ni chun inkhâwm pângngaiah rem an tih.
"For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day’s riot, there being no cause for it: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.","Vawisûna nasêtum lei hin suosal ṭiumin ei um ta hi, a bul um si loin; chuongchu a ni leiin, hi inkhâwmna san hi iengkhawm ei hril thei âwm naw hi,” a ta."
"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.","Chun, chuong ang thu a hril zo chun, umkhâwmhai chu ân ṭintir tah a."
"And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place.","Chun, Pentikost ni a hung tlungin, an rêngin hmun khatah an um khâwm vawng a."
"And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.","Chun, kârloin vâna inthawkin ri thlipui hrâng angin a hung tlung ta phut a. Chu chun an ṭhungna in chu a suksip ta vawng a."
"And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.","Chun, leihai ama le ama insemin, mei angin an kuomah a hung inlâr ta a."
"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.","Chun, an chungah a chuong seng a, an rêngin Thlarau Inthiengin an sip ta vawng a, Thlarauin ân ṭawngtir ang peiin ṭawng danghaiin an lo ṭawng tah a."
"Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.","Chun, vânkhuphnuoia hnam tin laia mi Pathien ngaisak Judahai Jerusalemah an châm a."
"And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language.","Chun, chu ri chu an hriet phingleh mipui an hung inkhâwm a, mi tinin an ṭawng chu mâni ṭawng sengin an lo hriet leiin an lungrilin an lo buoi a."
"And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilæans?","Chun, an rêng chun an lunginzîng a, mak an ti hleh a; “En ta u, hieng a ṭawnghai po po hi Galili rama mi an ni naw am a nih?"
"And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?",Iengtiziea ei rênga ei ṭawng piengpui anga ei hriet seng am a na?
"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judæa and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,","Ṭhenkhat Parthai hnam dâm, Medai hnam dâm, Elamatai hnam dâm, ei ni sih a; Mesopotamia rama um dâm, Judai rama um dâm, Kappadoki rama um dâm, Ponto rama um dâm, Asia rama um dâm,"
"in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,","Phrugia rama um dâm, Pamphulia rama um dâm, Aigupta rama um dâm, Kurini kâwl vêla Libu rama um ei na,"
"Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.","ṭhenkhat Rom khaw mikhuol — Judahai le an saphunhai leh-ei na, ṭhenkhat Kret thlierkâra mi le Arab rama mi ei ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, Pathien thilthaw ropuihai an hril mâni ṭawng sengin ei hriet si hi!” an ta."
"And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?","Chun, an rêng chun mak an ti hleh a, a ngaina an hriet nawh a, “Hieng hi iengtizie am a na?” an in tih a."
"But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.","Ṭhenkhatin an nuisan a, “Uoin thar an inrui a ni hi,” an ta."
"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, saying, Ye men of Judæa, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chu sâwm le pakhathai leh an ngîr a, ama chun rawl inringtakin, an kuomah a hril a, “Nangni Judai rama mihai, nangni Jerusalema um po pohai, hieng hi hre unla, ka thu khawm lo ngai ro."
"For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day;","Hienghai hi in ring angin an inrui nawh, vairik chau a la ni hi."
but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:,Hieng hi zâwlnei Joelin a hril kha a ni lem:
"And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your young men shall see visions, And your old men shall dream dreams:","Pathienin, ‘Ni nuhnungahai chun hieng hi nîng a ta, Mi po po chungah ka Thlarau buok ka ta; Chuongchun, in naupahai, in naunuhaiin ka thu hril an tih; In tlangvâlhaiin inlârnahai hmûng an ta, In tarhaiin mangah mang an ta;"
Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.,"Anih, chuong nia chun ka suokpahai, ka suoknuhai chunga khawm, Ka Thlarau buok ka ta, ka thu hril an tih,"
"And I will show wonders in the heaven above, And signs on the earth beneath; Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:","Chun, chungtieng vânah thilmakhai, Hnuoi tieng leihnuoiah inchiknahai inhmutir ka tih: Thisen dâm, mei dâm, meikhu hu dâm,"
"The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come, That great and notable day:","Nisa inthimin inchang a ta, Thla thisenin inchang a ta, Lalpa ni ropuitak le hminginthangtak chu A hung tlung hma chun;"
"And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.","Chun, hieng hi nîng a ta, Tûkhawm Lalpa hming lam taphawt chu sandaminum an tih,’ a tih, a ti kha."
"Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know;","“Nangni Israel mihai hieng thu hi lo ngai ro; Nazareth Isu chu, Pathienin nangni lai thilthaw mak dâm, thilmak dâm, inchikna dâm inthawtirin ân hriet chiengtir cheu kha,"
"him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay:","Nangni ngeiin in hriet ang khan; kha mipa kha Pathien rêl tlat le hriet lâwk angin an inmantir a, nangnîn mi suolhai kutin krawsah in hemdeh a, in sukhlum tah a."
"whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.","Kha mipa kha Pathienin thina khuopnahai chu a sûtpêk a, a keitho tah a; ama chu thina chel sawng ruol a ni naw leiin."
"For David saith concerning him, I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:","Chun, David chun ama thu chu a hril a, ‘Ka hmaah kumkhuoin Lalpa chu ka hmu hlak, Kân hnîng nawna dingin ka changtieng a um a nih;"
"Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope:","Chuleiin, ka lungril a hlim a, Ka lei khawm a lâwm a; Chuleiin, ka tisa khawm beiseitakin um bawk a tih;"
"Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades, Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.","Ka thlarau mithi khuoah mâksan naw ti nih a, I mi inthieng hmawnhmangna hmu khawm phal naw ti nih a;"
Thou madest known unto me the ways of life; Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.,"Nangin hringna lampuihai i mîn hriettir a, Nangin i hmêlin lâwmin mi suksip i tih,’ tiin."
"Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day.","“Unauhai, chi thlatu David chanchin hi ṭi loin in kuomah ka hril cheu a; ama chu a thi a; phûm khawm an phûm tah annâwm, a thlân khawm tu chen hin ei kuomah a la um zing a."
"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set one upon his throne;","Ama chu zâwlnei a na, Pathienin a ṭhalbea mi tû amanih a ṭhungpha chungah ân ṭhungtir ding a nih ti inkhâmin a hril ti a hriet a."
"he foreseeing this spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.","Chuongchun, chuong chu a lo hriet lâwk zing leiin, Krista thonâwkna ding thu a hril a nih, ‘Mithi khuoah mâksanin a um nawh a, a ruong khawmin hmawnna a hmu bawk nawh,’ tiin."
"This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.","Chu Isu chu Pathienin a keitho nâwk ta hrim a, chu chu kan rêng hin a hretu kan nih."
"Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.","Pathien kut changtienga chawi- mawiin a um a, Thlarau Inthieng tiem chu Pa kuoma inthawkin a hmuh a, in hmu le in hriet hi a hung buok a ni hi."
"For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,","David chu vânah a hang lâwn naw a nih, ama ngeiin, ‘Lalpa chun ka Lalpa kuomah, Ka changtieng ṭhung zing rawh,"
Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.,"I hmêlmahai i kepha innghatnaa Ka siem hmakhat chu,’ a tih a, a ti lem a ni kha."
"Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.","“Chuongchun, Isu in hemde ngei kha, Pathienin Lal le Krista ni fâwmin a siem tah ti, Israel hnam tinin hre mawl raw se,” a ta."
"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?","Chun, chuong thu chu an hrietin an lungrilah sun ang an lo ni tah a, Peter le tirko danghai kuoma chun, “Unauhai, iengtin am thaw tâng kan ta?” an tih a."
"And Peter said unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.","Peter chun an kuomah, “In suolhai ngaidamna dingin, sim unla, Isu Krista hmingin baptisma chang seng ro; chuongchun, Thlarau Inthieng pêk hi hmûng in tih."
"For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.","A tiem kha, nangni ta ding khawmin, in nauhai ta ding khawmin, hlataka mi po po ta ding khawmin, Lalpa ei Pathienin a kuoma a kohai taphawt ta dingin a nih ie,” a ta."
"And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.","Chun, thu dang tamtakin a hrilfieh a, “Tulai ruolthar rilohaia in- thawk hin insukhim ro,” tiin ân fui a."
They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand souls.,"Chun, a thu zâwm taphawt chun baptisma an chang tah a; chu nia chun mi sâng thum lai belsain an um a."
"And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.","Chun, tirkohai inchûktirin, in- pâwlin, bei khawiin, ṭawngṭaiin ṭhahnemngaitakin an um zing a."
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.,"Chun, mi tinin an ṭi tah a; tirkohai chun thilmak le inchikna tamtak an thawh a."
"And all that believed were together, and had all things common;","Chun, a ring taphawt chun iengkim an inṭâwm a,"
"and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.","an thil neihai, an thuom- hnawhai an zawr a, an mamaw dai tâwk seng chauin an rênga kuoma chun an sem hlak."
"And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,","Ni tin lungril hmunkhatin Pathien biekina chun ṭhahnem- ngaitakin an um hlak a, an in tieng khawm bei an khawi a, hlimtak le lungawitakin bu an fâk hlak a."
"praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.","Pathien an inpâk a, mi po po lâwmzâwngin an um hlak. Chun, sandama hung um pei taphawthai chu, Lalpain ni tin an kuomah ân ṭhangsatir pei hlak."
"And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.","Chun, nasêtum chu a re zo chun, Paulain inchûktirhai ân kotir a, ân fui a, ṭawng bauṭhain a ṭheh a, Makedonia rama fe dingin a suok tah a."
"And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.","Chun, thu tamtaka inchûktirhai infui peiin chu ram chu a fang suok a, Grik ram a tlung tah a."
"And when he had spent three months there, and a plot was laid against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.","Chun, chutaka chun thla thum a thang hnungin Suria ram tieng lawngin a fe ding a na, Judahaiin ama an phierrûk leiin Makedonia rama fe nghâl a tum nâwk lem tah a."
"And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.","Chun, Purrha naupa Sopater Beroia khuoa mi hai, Thessalonikaa mi Aristarka le Sekunda hai, Derbea mi Gaia hai, Timothe hai, Asia ram mi Tukik le Trophim hai, ama leh Asia rama chun an va fe veh a."
"But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.","Chuonghai chun kan hma an ṭhuoi a, Troasa chun an mi lo nghâk zing a."
"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we tarried seven days.","Keini ruok chu Chawlṭhanglo Bei ruoiṭhe ni po po hnunga chun Philippia inthawk chu lawngin kan suok a, ni nga chenah Troasah an kuom kan tlung a; chutaka chun ni sari kan châm a."
"And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.","Chun, ni saria ni hmasataka chun, bei khawi dinga kan um khâwm laiin, Paulain a zînga fe a tum leiin ṭhahnemngaitakin thu a hril a; zân ril chenin thu a hril pei a."
And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.,"Chun, pindan chunghnung kan um khâwmnaa chun khâwnvar tamtak a um a."
"And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.","Chun, a hming Eutuk, tlangvâl pakhat tukvera chun a ṭhung a, a lo inlusu a lo inlusuh a. Paula thuhril chu a sâwt ta leiin a îmu suok chu a tuor ta nawh a, in sâwng thumnaa inthawk chun a tla tah a, a thiin an lâk tah a."
"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula a ṭum a, a zu bawh a, a zu pawm a, “Thla- phâng naw ro, a hnuk a la chat nawh,” a ta."
"And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.","Chun, Paula a hang lâwn nâwk a, bei chu a khawi a, bu a fâk a, sâwttak, khawvar rakin an kuomah thukhawchâng a hril a, chu hnunga chun a fe tah a."
"And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.","Chun, tleirawl chu damin an ṭhuoi a, thlamuong namênin an thlamuong ta nawh a."
"But we, going before to the ship, set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.","Chun, keini ruok chu lawngah kan lo fe tah a, Asso pan dingin lawng chun kan suok hmasa a, chutaka chun Paula chu inchuongtir kan tum a; ama chun kea hung a tum leiin chuong ang chun amain a ruot hrim a nih."
"And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.","Chun, Assoah a mi hung pâwl nâwk chun kan inchuongtir tah a, Mitulin kan tlung a."
"And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.","Chutaka inthawk chun lawngin kan fe nâwk a, a zînga chun Kia thlierkâr zâwn kan tlung a; a zing nâwk Sami thlierkâr kan sir a; chu zîng nâwk chun Mileti kan tlung nâwk a."
"For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.","Chun, Paulain Asia rama um sâwt a nuom naw leiin, Ephesi chu lawnga khêl a tum sa hrim a na, a thei chun Jerusalemah Penti- kost ni nang a tum a, a fe inhmaw a nih,"
"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.","Chun, Miletia inthawkin Ephe- siah mi a tir a, kohrana upahai a kuomah ân kotir a."
"And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,","Chun, a kuoma an hung tlung chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Asia ram ka sir hlima inthawk tah, in kuoma ka um sûng po khan ka um dân kha in hriet a."
"serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;","Judahaiin an mi phierrûk leia mitthli tla le, thil rinum ka chunga tlahai tuor pumin thuhnuoirawltakin Lalpa rawng ka bâwl hlak kha."
"how I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house,","Khâng khan a sâwt ding thil chu in kuomah iengkhawm hril intîm ka nei nawh a, vantlâng lai dâm inchûktir ka ma naw kha."
"testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.","Judahai le Grikhai kuoma khawm Pathien tienga lungril inlet thu le, ei Lalpa Isu Krista tieng ringna ding thu kân hriettir hlak kha."
"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:","Chun, hre ro, tuhin lungrila fe lo thei loa kân hriet leiin, Jerusalemah ka fe ding a ni hi, chutaka chun ka chunga thil hung tlung ding chin ka hriet nawh."
"save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.","Thlarau Inthiengin ‘Khuopna le rinumnain a tuok che’, tiin khaw tinah a mîn hriettir hlak, chu chau chu ka hriet a nih."
"But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.","Nisienlakhawm, kân tlânsiekna lam ka hmabâk suo ding le, Pathien lunginsietzie Chanchin Ṭha in- hriettir ding, Lalpa Isua inthawka kha rawngbâwl sin ka hmu kha, thaw zo phawt lang chu, ka hringna khawm thlâkhlâ tlâkah ka ruot nawh."
"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.","“Chun, hre ro, nangni po po, Pathien ram thu khêkpuia kân vâk kân vâkna hlakhai hin ka hmêl hmu nâwk ta naw ti niu ti ka hriet a."
"Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.","Chuleiin, mi po po thisenah ka hul a nih ti vawisûn hin kân hriettir cheu."
For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God.,Pathien rêl po po arêngin in kuoma hril kân tîm nawh a.
"Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.","Pathien kohran ama thisena a inchâwk chu, châwm dingin, nangni le inrawihai po po chunga chun fimkhur ro, Thlarau Inthiengin an chunga hotuin a siem cheu hi."
"I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock;","Ka fe hnungin satene hrânghai nangni lai hung lût an ta, pâwlruol chu hla naw ni hai ti ka hriet."
"and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.","Nangni laia mi khawm, inchûktirhai an kuoma inkawptir dingin thu hran hril la hung um an tih."
"Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.","Chuleiin, ngaiven ro; kum thum rau, mitthli tla pumin asûn azâna, mi tin hal ka ma naw kha hre zing ro."
"And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.","“Tuhin Pathien le a lunginsiet- na thu kuomah kân kawltir cheu, chu chun a siem lien thei cheu a, mi inthienghai lai ro chan ân neitir thei bawk cheu a."
"I coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.","Tu tangkahai, rângkachakhai, silfênhai khawm kân hnar ngai naw kha."
"Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.",Hi kuthai hin kei le ka ruolhai pawimaw chu a them suok hlak kha nangni ngeiin in hriet a.
"In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.","Iengkim ka thaw taphawt ka thawhmu hlak cheu kha, chuonga sininrim pum le, Lalpa Isu thu hre zing pumin mi hrâtnawhai in ṭhang- pui ding a nih; ama ngeiin, ‘Iengkhat lâk nêkin pêkin lukhâwng a nei lem’, a ti kha,” a ta."
"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.","Chun, chuong ang thu chu a hril zo chun, a dingṭhaṭhuon a, an rêngin a ṭawngṭaipui a."
"And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,","Chun, an rêng chun an ṭap a, Paula chu an kuoh a, an fâwp an fâwp a."
"sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.","A hmêl an hmu nâwk naw ding thu a hril chu an lungngaina tak a nih. Chun, lawng chen chun ama an inthla tah a."
"And when it came to pass that we were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:","Chun, anni le chun kan inṭheh a, lawngin kan suok a, chu hnunga chun tlûntakin Kos thlierkâr kan tlung a; chun, a zîngah Rodi thlierkâr kan tlung nâwk a, chutaka inthawkin kan fe pei a, Patara kan tlung a;"
"and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.","chun, Phoiniki ram kai ding lawng pakhat kan hmuh a, kan chuong a, kan fe pei tah a."
"And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden.","Chun, Kupra thlierkâr kan hmuh a, vawitieng panin kan khêl a, Suria ram tieng kan fe pei a, Turaa chun khawmuolah kan suok phawt a; chu- taka chun lawnga thuomhnaw thak suok ding a nih a."
"And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.","Chun, inchûktirhai kan zawng suok a, chutaka chun ni sari kan châm a. Anni chun, Thlarau hrilin, Paula kuomah, Jerusalem sir lo ding an ta."
"And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell;","Nisienlakhawm, chuong ni zoa chun kan suok a, kan fe tah a, unauhai chun an rêngin, an nuhmei an nauhai leh khaw kâwl chenin an mi vân thlah a; chun, tuisuoriet panga chun kan dingṭhaṭhuon a, kan ṭawngṭai a."
"and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.","Chun, “Damtakin”, kan in tih a, lawnga chun kan chuong a; anni ruok chu an inah an kîr nâwk tah a."
"And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.","Chun, Turaa inthawka lawnga kan fe zo chun Ptolemai kan tlung a, unauhai chibai kan bûk a, an kuomah ni khat kan châm a."
"And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Cæsarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.","Chun, a zînga chun kan suok a, Kaisari kan tlung a, Chanchin Ṭha hriltu Philip inah kan lût a, ama chu pasari hai lai khan pakhat a na, a kuomah kan châm a."
"Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.","Ama chun naunuhmei pali a nei a, nunghâk inthieng an nih, Pathien thu an hril hlak a."
"And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judæa a certain prophet, named Agabus.","Chun, chutaka chun ni tamtak kan châm a, chu lai chun Judai rama inthawkin a hming Agaba, Zâwlnei pakhat a hung thlah a."
"And coming to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.","Kan kuomah a hung a, Paula kâwnghrên a lâk a, a kehai, a kuthai ama le ama ân khuop a, chun, “Jerusalema Judahai chun hi kâwnghrên neitu hi hieng ang hin khuop an tih, Jentailhai kutah pe bawk an tih, Thlarau Inthiengin a tih,” a ta."
"And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.","Chuong thu chu kan hriet phingleh, keini le chu khuoa mihai chun Paula chu Jerusalema hang fe lo dingin kan ngên ta rak a."
"Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.","Paula chun a dawn a, “Ieng am in ti a ni leh, in ṭap in ṭap a, ka thla in suksie ie! Lalpa Isu hming lei chun Jerusalema khuop chau ni loin, thi khawm ka huom in sawnnaw,” a ta."
"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.","Chun, thlêm ruol a ni naw hnung chun, “Lalpa thu thu ni raw se,” kan ta, kan ma tah a."
And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.,"Chun, chu hnunga chun kan thuomhnaw kan siem a, Jerusalemah kan hang feh a."
"And there went with us also certain of the disciples from Cæsarea, bringing with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.","Kaisaria mi inchûktir tuhai amanih kan kuomah an fe veh a, anni chun a hming Mnason, inchûktir hmasa pâwl, Kupra thlierkâra mi pakhat, kan tlung-in dingpa chu an ṭhuoi veh a."
"And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.","Chun, Jerusalem kan tlung chun unauhaiin hlimtakin an mi lo lâwm a."
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.,A zînga chun Paula rawiin Jakob kuomah kan lût a; chutaka chun kohran upahai po po khawm an um a.
"And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry.","Chun, Paulain anni chibai a bûk zoin, a rawngbâwlna hmanga Pa- thienin Jentailhai laia thil ân thawtirhai chu a kip a kawiin a hril a."
"And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:","Chun, unauhai chun chuong thu chu an hrietin Pathien an chawi- mawi a; chun, Paula kuoma chun, “Unau, Judahai laia ringtu tamzie i hmuh a; an rêngin Dân chungah ṭhahnem an ngai bawk a."
"and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.","Chun, nangin Jentailhai laia Juda umhai po po kuoma chun an nauhai ser tan lo ding le, dân anga um naw ding tiin, Mosie peithlâkna thu în chûktir hlak ti mi bauah an hriet a."
What is it therefore? they will certainly hear that thou art come.,Iengtin am ni tâng a ta? I hung tlung ti an hriet ngei âwm sih a.
Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;,"Chuleiin, i kuoma kan hril ang hin thaw rawh: Thutiem nei pasal pali kan kuomah an um."
"these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.","Chuonghai chu ṭhuoi la, anni lai inthien fai ve la, an lu an vaw theina dingin an ta dingin sum sêng rawh: chuongchun, mi po poin mi baua i thu an hriethai kha, a tak a ni naw hrieng an ta, nang ngei Dân hrawin feltakin i um lem a nih hre el an tih."
"But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.","Jentailhai laia ringtu thu chu, milim biekna thil fâk kawnga dâm, sa thisen fâk kawnga dâm, sa râkhlum fâk kawnga dâm, indit kawnga dâm an insukthieng ding a nih, tiin ei rêl a, ei ziek ta kha,” an ta."
"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.","Chun, a zînga chun Paulain pasalhai chu a ṭhuoi a, anni lai ân thienfai veh a, Pathien biekina chun a lût a, an ta dinga sa that seng ding a pêk pêk hmakhat chu inthienfainain an nei hri ding a nih ti, thiempu kuoma chun an hril lâwk a."
"And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,","Chun, ni sari chu a tling vângin Asia rama Judahai chun Paula chu Pathien biekinah an hmuh a, mipui po po an infui a, ama chu an man a,"
"crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.","an khêk a, “Israel mihai, mi ṭhangpui ro, hi mipa hi ram tinah mi po po kuomah, Juda mi dâm, Dân dâm, hi in dâm hi hrilsetu kha a nih; chu naw khawm chu Pathien biekina hin Grik mihai khawm a lûtpui a, hi in inthieng hi a suktirdakum tah a nih,” an ta."
"For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.","(Chu hma chun khuoa chun Ephesia mi Trophim chu a kuomah an hmuh a, Paulain ama chu Pathien biekina a lûtpui an ring sih a)."
"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.","A khuo chun an inlap ta mer mur a, mihai chu an tlân khâwm a. Paula an man a, Pathien biekina inthawk chun an kei dawk a, kawthai chu an khâr nghâl tah a."
"And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.","Chun, ama chu sukhlum an tum lai chun Jerusalema mi po po an buoi ti thu chu sipai pâwl hotu laltak kuom a hang tlung a."
"And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.","Ama chun sipaihai le sipai za hotuhai a ṭhuoi nghâl tah a, an kuomah a tlân thlah a. Anni chun sipai hotu laltak le sipaihai an hmu chun Paula vuok chu an ma tah a."
"Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.","Chun, hotu laltak chun a hung hnai a, Paula a chel a, khaidiet pahni inbuntir ding thu a pêk a; tû am a ni, ieng am a thaw ân dawn a."
"And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.","Chun, mipui lai chun a ṭhen thu pakhatin an khêk a, a ṭhen thu dangin an khêk a. Chu, nasêtum lei chun a ziezâng a hriet thei nawh a, kulbîngah ṭhuoi lût ding thu a pêk a."
"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;","Chun, Paula kailâwn a tlung laiin mipuiin an thaw nasat leiin sipaihaiin ama chu an dawm kâng pei a;"
"for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.","mi po poin, “Sukbohmang ro” tia khêkin an zui hut hut sih a."
"And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?","Chun, Paula chu kulbînga chun an ṭhuoi lût ding laiin, ama chun sipai za hotu laltak kuoma chun, “I kuomah thu bau khat hril thei ka ti?” a ta. Ama chun, “Grik ṭawng i hriet maw?"
"Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?","Inhmaa mihai infuia, mihriem philhmanghai sângli thlalêra ṭhuoi suoktu Aigupta rama mi kha i ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
"But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.","Paula chun, “Juda mi, Kiliki rama Tarsa khuoa mi ka nih, khaw namêna um ka ni nawh; mi lunginsiet la, mi po po kuomah thu mîn hriltir rawh,” a ta."
"And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,","Chun, a remti phingleh, Paula kailâwna chun a ngîr a, mi po po tona dingin kutin a zâp a; chun an to ṭhuop phingleh Hebrai ṭawngin an kuomah:"
"Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you.","“Unauhai, pahai, tuhin in kuomah ka thiemna thu ka hril ding cheu a ni hi lo ngai ro,” a ta."
"And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,","Chun, Hebrai ṭawngin an kuomah thu a hril ti an hriet phingin an to nâwk zuol a;"
"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day:","chun, ama chun, “Juda mi ka nih, Kiliki ram Tarsa khuoa pieng ka nih; nisienlakhawm, hi khuoa hin Gamaliel ke bula inchûka inṭhang lien ka nih, ei thlatuhai Dân khermeitak chu inchûka um hlak ka nih, vawisûna nangni ang tak hin, Pathien ta dinga ṭhahnem bawk hlak ka nih."
"and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.","Hi Lama mihai hi sukhlum rau khawpin ka suknawmna hlak a, a nuhmei a pasalin ka khuop a, intângna inah kân khumtir hlak a."
"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.","Thiempu Laltak le upahai po po khawmin chuong thu chu an mi hrietpui thei, an kuoma inthawka unauhai pêk dingin lekha ka hmu kha; chun, Damaskaa um taphawt an hrem dingin, khuop puma Jeru- salema ṭhuoi dingin ka fe kha."
"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.","“Chun, ka feh a, Damaska khaw kâwl ka tlung chun, sûnbu fâk pha laiin, kârloin vâna inthawka var nasatak ka vêlah a hung var phut a."
"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?","Chun, hnuoiah ka tluh a, ka kuomah, ‘Saula, Saula, nangin ieng- dinga i mi suknawmna am a na?’ tiin rawl ka hriet a."
"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.","Chun, keiin, ‘Tu am i na, Lalpa?’ tiin ka dawn a. Ama chun ka kuomah, ‘Nazareth Isu i suknawmnat hi ka nih,’ a ta."
"And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.","Ka ruolhai chun var chu an hmu dea chu, a mi betu rawl ruok chu an hriet nawh."
"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.","Chun, keiin, ‘Lalpa, ieng am thâwng ka ta?’ ka ta. Lalpa chun ka kuomah, ‘Tho la, Damaskaah lût rawh, thil po po i thaw dinga ruot taphawt chu hril an ti che,’ a ta."
"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus.","Chun, chu var nasat lei chun khuo ka hmu thei ta nawh a, ka ruolhaiin kutin an mi kei a, Damaskaah ka lût tah a."
"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,","“Chun, mi pakhat, Anania, Dân kawnga Pathien ngaisak le chutaka Juda umhai po po kuoma hming ṭha chu,"
"came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.","ka kuomah a hung a, ka kâwlah a ngîr a, ka kuomah, ‘Unau Saula, mitvar nei rawh,’ a mi ta. Chu lai tak chun ka mit chu a hung var a, ama ka hang hmu tah a."
"And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.","Chun, ama chun, ‘Ei thlatuhai Pathienin a ditzâwng hre ding le, Mi feltak chu hmua, a ṭawngbau khawm hre dingin a ruot ta che."
For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.,I hmu le i hriet thua khan mi po po kuomah ama thu hretu nîng i tih.
"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.","Chun, iengdinga i la um zing am? Tho la, ama hming lam pumin baptisma chang la, i suolhai sâwpfai ta la,’ a mi ta."
"And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,","“Chun, Jerusalema hin ka kîr nâwk hnungin, Pathien biekina ka ṭawngṭai laiin, zêlin ka um a;"
"and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me.","chun, ‘Inhmaw la, Jerusalema inthawkin suok rawh; ka chanchin i hril ding chu an pawm âwm naw hi,’ a mi ti lai ka hmuh a."
"And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:","“Chun, keiin, ‘Lalpa inkhâwm- na in tinah a ringtu che taphawt intângna inah ka khum a, ka vuok hlak kha an hriet sih a;"
"and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him.","chun, i thu hretu Stephan thisen an insuo lai khan kei khawm an kâwlah ka ngîr a, ka lo remtih a, a sukhlumtuhai puonhai dâm ka lo vêng tâwl bawk a nih,’ ka ta."
"And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.","“Chun, ama chun, ‘Fe rawh; hitaka inthawka hlatakah, Jentail- hai kuomah tir lem ka ti che,’ a mi tih a,” a ta."
"And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.","Chun, chu thu chen chun an ngai a, rawl inringtakin, “Mi hieng ang hrep hi, khawvêla inthawkin sukbohmang ro, hring tlâk khawm a ni nawh,” an ti tah a."
"And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,","An khêk a, an puonhai an hlîp a, an pei a, pilvut an vânvawr a,"
"the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.","chuongchun, sipai hotu laltak chun Paula chu kulbîng sûnga ṭhuoi lût thu a pêk a, a chunga chuong ang lâwma an khêkna san chu hrietna dingin vuok puma suosal dingin a tih a."
"And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?","Chun, savun hruia an khuop zoin, Paulain a kâwla ngîr sipai za hotu kuoma chun, “Rom mi hrim hrim in vuok thei am a nih? thiemnaw inchangtir hnung khawm ni si loin,” a ta."
"And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman.","Sipai za hotu chun chu chu a hriet phingleh, sipai hotu laltak kuomah chun a feh a, “I thil thaw ding hi fimkhur raw khai! Hi mipa hi Rom mi a lo nih ie,” a ta, a hril a."
"And the chief captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea.","Chun, sipai hotu laltak chu a hung a, a kuomah, “Rom mi i ni maw? Mi hril rawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Nih e,” a ta."
"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am a Roman born.","Sipai hotu laltak chun, “Chu khuoa mi ni dingin kei chu tangka tamtak ka sêng annaw,” a ta, a dawn a. Paula chun, “Kei chu Rom mia pieng hrim ka nih,” a ta."
"They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.","Chuongchun, sawisak puma suosal tumtuhai chun ama chu an mâksan nghâl tah a; sipai hotu laltak khawmin Rom mi a nih ti a hriet chun a ṭih a, ama a khuop lei khan a ṭi bawk a."
"But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.","Chun, a zînga chun Judahaiin ieng leiin am Paula an hêka ti hriet fel tumin sipai hotu laltak chun ama chu a sût a, thiempu lalhai le rorêltuhai po po inkhâwm dingin thu a pêk a, Paula a ṭhuoi thlâk a, an hmaah ân ngirtir ta a."
"And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.","Chun, Paula chun rorêltuhai chu a en zing a, “Unauhai, vawisûn chen hin Pathien mithmua ṭha tienga ka hriet taphawt chu thawin ka um hlak,” a ta."
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.,"Chun, thiempu Laltak Anania chun, Paula kâwla ngîrhai kuomah, a baua benpêk ding a ta."
"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?","Paula chun a kuomah, “Nang lung bang nâlvârpa, Pathienin ben lem a ti che; nang Dân anga mi ngai- tuo dingin i ṭhung a, Dân naw anga mi ben ding i ti vei a ni maw?” a ta."
"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?","Chun, a kâwla mihaiin, “Pathien thiempu Laltak i hal vei maw?” an ta."
"And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.","Chun, Paulain, “Unauhai, thiem- pu Laltak a ni ti ka hriet nawa a nih, ‘I chipuihai hotu chungah thu ṭhanaw hril naw’ ti khawm ziek a ni sih a,” a ta."
"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.","Chun, Paulain a ṭhen Saddukai, a ṭhen Pharisaihai an nih ti a lo hrietin rorêltuhai lai chun a khêk a, “Unauhai, Pharisai ka nih, Pharisai naupa khawm ka nih; beiseina le mithi thonâwkna thuah suosalin ka um a ni hi,” a ta."
"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.","Chun, chu chu a hril phingleh, Pharisaihai le Saddukaihai an lo insêl a, rorêltuhai chu an inkhing tah a."
"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.","(Saddukaihaiin, “Mithi thonâwk- na hrim a um nawh, vântirkohai, thlarauhai khawm an um bawk nawh,” an ti hlak; Pharisaihai ruok chun chu kawng pahni chu a um an awi sih a.)"
"And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?","Chuongchun, nasatakin an buoi tah a; Pharisai tienga mi Dân inchûktirtu ṭhenkhat an ngîr a, an sêl a, “Hi mipa hi a suolna iengkhawm kan hriet nawh ie; thlarau khawmin, vântirko khawmin ama hi be sienla ieng am pawi a ta?” an ta."
"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.","Chun, an insêl nasa deu deu leiin, sipai hotu laltak chun Paula an kei nâwi a ṭih a, sipaihai kuomah, zu fea anni laia inthawka kulbînga hung ṭhuoi lût el dingin a ta."
"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.","Chun, zâna chun Lalpa chu Paula kâwlah a ngîr a, “Thlamuong- takin um rawh, Jerusalema ka thu în hriettir ang bawkin Roma khawm în hriettir ding a nih,” a ta."
"And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.","Chun, nisa a suok chun Judahai an ṭhang ruol a, Paula an that hmakhat chu iengkhawm faa dâwn lo dingin an inkhâm a."
And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.,Chu thu phierrutuhai chu sâwmli nêka tam lem an nih.
"And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.","Anni chu thiempu lalhai le upahai kuomah an feh a, “Paula kan that hmakhat chu iengkhawm intem lo dingin kan inkhâm tah a nih."
"Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.","Chuleiin, nangnîn, rorêltuhai le a thu fel nâwkzuola ngaituo tum angin, in kuoma ṭhuoi thla dingin sipai hotu laltak kuomah pehêl deuin hang hril ro; in kâwl hnai a tlung hma khawmin keini ama that dingin kan inpei zing a nih,” an ta."
"But Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula farnu naupa chun an inchân thu chu a lo hriet a, kulbînga chun a va lût a, Paula a va hril a."
"And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.","Chun, Paula chun sipai za hotu pakhat a ko a, “Hi tlangvâl hi hotu laltak kuoma chun ṭhuoi rawh; a kuomah thu ieng amanih hril ding a nei a ni âwm ie,” a ta."
"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.","Chuongchun, sipai hotu laltak kuoma chun a va ṭhuoi a, “Paula intâng khan a mi ko a, hi tlangvâl hi i kuoma hung ṭhuoi dingin a mi tir a, i kuomah thu ieng amanih hril ding a nei a ni âwm ie,” a ta."
"And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?","Sipai hotu laltak chun, a kutah a chel a, a fe hranpui a, inrûkin, “Ieng am mi hril ding i nei chu?” a ta, ân dawn a."
"And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul to-morrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.","Chun, ama chun, “Paula thu fel nâwk zuola i ngaituo ding angin, zîngah rorêltuhai kuoma ṭhuoi thlâk dingin Judahaiin hni che an remti tlâng a."
"Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.","Nisienlakhawm, an thu lo awi naw rawh; anni laia mi sâwmli nêka tam lemin an inchân zing a, chuonghai chun ama an that hmakhat chu iengkhawm faa dâwn lo dingin an inkhâm a; tuhin i thu nghâkin inpei sa zingin an um a nih,” a ta."
"So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.","Chun, sipai hotu laltak chun tlangvâl chu ân fetir a, “Hieng thu hi i mîn hriettir tah ti tukhawm hril naw rawh,” a ta."
"And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Cæsarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:","Chun, sipai za hotu pahni a ko a, “Zân, zâl hun pha, Kaisari chena fe ding sipai za hni leh, sakawr chung chuong mi sâwmsari leh, fei chawi mi za hni leh siem ro,” a ta."
"and he bade them provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.","Chun, Bawrsâp Felik kuoma chun, himtaka ân tlun theina dingin, Paula an inchuongtirna dingin sahai lo siem ding a ti bawk a."
And he wrote a letter after this form:,"Chun, hieng ang hin lekha a ziek a;"
"Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.",“Klaudi Lusiain Felik Bawrsâp ṭhatak chibai a bûk.
"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.","“Hi mipa hi Judahaiin an man a, an that ding laiin an kuomah sipaihai ṭhuoiin ka feh a, Rom mi a nih ti ka hriet a, ka san suok tah a."
"And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:","Chun, an hêkna san hriet ka nuom a, an rorêltuhai kuomah ka ṭhuoi thlâk a."
"whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.","Chuongchun, an dân thu ieng ienga manih hêk a nih ti ka hriet a, nisienlakhawm, an hêkna thuah thina le khuopna khawp rau dingin iengkhawm ka hriet si nawh."
"And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.","Chun, Judahaiin ama an inchân ti miin an mîn hriettir phingleh, i kuomah ama hi ka hung tir nghâl ta a nih, a hêktuhai khawm, a chunga thupawi an nei taphawt chu i hmaa hril dingin thu ka pêk bawk a,” tiin."
"So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.","Chuongchun, sipaihai chun a thupêk ang chun, Paula chu a zân a zânin an ṭhuoi a, Antipatri an tlungpui a."
"But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:","A zînga chun sakawr chung chuong mihai chu, ama le fe pei dingin an kîr san a, kulbînga chun an fe nâwk tah a."
"and they, when they came to Cæsarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.","Chun, anni chu Kaisari khuo chu an tlung a, Bawrsâp kuomah lekha chu an pêk a, Paula khawm a hmaah an inngîrtir a."
"And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,","Bawrsâp chun a tiem zoin Paula umna ram ân dawn a. Chun, Kiliki ram mi a nih ti a hriet phingleh,"
"I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.","“A hêktuhai che an hung tlung phingleh, i thupawi ngaituong ka tih,” a ta. Chun, Herod inah vêng ding thu a pêk a."
"And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.","Chun, ni nga chenah Thiempu Laltak Anani a hung tlung thlah a, upa tuhai amanih leh, a hming Tertulla thuhril thiem pakhat leh; chun, Paula chunga thupawi chu Bawrsâp kuomah an hril a."
"And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation,","Chun, Paula chu an ko suok hnung chun, Tertulla chun ama a hêk phut a, “Felik ṭha tak, nangma zârin thlamuongtakin kan um lei le, i enkawl leia hi chihai ta dinga suolhai chu khap ṭhata a um hlak leiin,"
"we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.",kumkhuoin khâwlai khawm lungawitakin kan lâwm hlak.
"But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, i ta dinga nghawkum taluo ni ka nuom nawh a, I nunnêmnain thu baukhat ruok chu mi ngaipêk dingin ka hni che a nih."
"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:","Hi mipa hi mi theidaumtak, khawvêla Judahai po po chawkbuoitu le, Nazareth pâwla a ṭhuoitu pakhat a nih ti kan hriet a."
who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:,"Pathien biekin sukthieng naw a tum bawk a, chuleiin, kan man a nih; [kan dân anga a chungthu rêl kan nuom a,"
,"nisienlakhawm, sipai hotu tak Lusia a hung a, ka kuta mi chu a hung ṭhuoi lui tah a."
"from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.","Ama hêktuhai chu i hmaa inlang ding thu a pêk bawk a.] Nang ngeiin suosal la, kan hêkna thil po po hi amaa inthawkin hre thei i tih,” a ta."
"And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.","Judahai khawm chun, “Chuong thu chu chuong ang tak chu a nih,” tiin an lo ṭhangpui a."
"And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence:","Chun, Bawrsâp chun thu hril dinga Paula chu kuta a zâp phingleh, ama chun, “Nang kum tamtak hi chihai rorêl pêktu i nih ti ka hriet leiin lâwmtakin ka thiemna thu ka hril ding a ni hi."
seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:,Jerusalema Pathien be dinga ka hang fe chen chu ni sâwm le pahni bâk la ni naw nih ti hre thei i tih.
"and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.","Pathien biekina khawm, inkhâwmna inahai khawm khuoa khawm tukhawm ka sêl le mipui kân fui annîn an mi hmu bawk nawh,"
Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.,tu khawm hin an mi hêkna thu hi i hrietah a bula inthawkin sui suok thei bawk naw ni hai.
"But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;","Nisienlakhawm, hi thu hi i kuomah inphuong ka tih, ‘Chi hran,’ an ti, Lam dân angin ei thlatuhai Pathien ka biek hlak, Dân le zâwl- neihai lekhabua ziek po po ringin."
"having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.","Chun, mi fel le felnaw thonâwk- na um a tih ti Pathien tieng ka beisei a, hienghai khawm hin chu chu an awi ve bawk si."
Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.,"Chuleichun, Pathien kuom tienga le mihriem tienga khawm lungril suol naw mawl hi vawn tlat ka tum hlak."
"Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:","Chun, kum tamtak hnunga hin ka chipuihai lai thilpêk ding chawiin, inthâwina inhlân dingin ka hung a."
"amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asia—","Chuong lai chun, mipui le, nasêtum um loin, Pathien biekinah insukthiengin an mi hmuh a."
"who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.","Nisienlakhawm, chutaka chun Asia rama mi Juda tuhai amanih an um kha, chuonghai chun ka chungah thu an nei chun, hitaka hin i hmaa umin an mi hêk ding a nih."
"Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,","Annawleh, hienghai ngei hin rorêltu hmaa ka ngîr lai khan, ka suksuol ieng am an hmuh a, hril raw hai se,"
"except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.","anni laia ngîrin, hi thu baukhat, ‘Mithi thonâwkna thuah vawisûn hin in hmaah suosalin ka um a ni hi,’ ka ti lei kha a ni nghâl naw chun,” a ta, a dawn a."
"But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.","Chun, Felik chun Lam thu chu a hriet fel deu leiin, “Sipai hotu laltak Lusia chu a hung tlung thla pha in thu la rem ka tih,” tiin a sie ta hrih a."
"And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.","Chun, Paula chu duot deua, a ruolhai rawngbâwlpêk khap loa invêngtir dingin sipai za hotu chu thu a pêk a."
"But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.","Chun, ni iengzât chena manih Felik chu a hung nâwk a, a nuhmei Drusilla Juda nuhmei leh, Paula chu ân kotir a, Krista Isu ringna thu chu a ngai a."
"And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.","Paula chun, felna thu dâm, insûm thu dâm, ro a la rêl ding thu dâm ṭhahnemngaitaka a hril laiin Felik chun ṭium a ti bêk a, “Fe nâwk phawt ta rawh, hun remchâng ka nei pha ko ka ti che,” a ta."
"He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.","Paulain tangka a pêk a beisei bawk a, chuleiin, a ko inzing deu a, a biek hlak a nih."
"But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.","Chun, kum hni ân vawi hnungin Porkia Festain Felik chu a thleng tah a; Felik chun Judahai laia hmingṭhat a nuom a, Paula chu khuop sain a mâksan tah a."
"Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Cæsarea.","Chuongchun, Festa chun ram chu a awp tah a; chun, ni thum hnungin Kaisaria inthawk chun Jerusalemah a hang feh a."
"And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him,","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Juda hotuhai chun Paula chanchin chu a se tiengin an lo inhriettir a."
"asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.",Jerusalema hung inṭhuoitir ding- in lunginsietna an lo hni rak bawk a; lampuia lo inchâna that an tum a.
"Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Cæsarea, and that he himself was about to depart thither shortly.","Nisienlakhawm, Festa chun, “Paula Kaisariah an vêng zing a nih, kei khawm sâwtnawtêah ka fe ding a nih."
"Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.","Chuleiin, ama chun suolna a nei chun, nangni laia thuneituhaiin mi zui thla hai sienla, hêk raw hai se,” a ta."
"And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Cæsarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.","Chun, anni lai chun ni riet amanih, ni sâwm amani chau chu a châm nâwk a, Kaisariah a fe thlah a; chun, a zînga chun rorêlna ṭhungphaah a ṭhung a, Paula chu hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a."
"And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;","Chun, ama chu a hung tlung chun, Jerusalema inthawka Juda hung thlahai chu a vêla chun an ngir a, a chungah thupawi tamtak, rik tak tak an hril an hril a, a bul ruok chu an sui suok thei si nawh a."
"while Paul said in his defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I sinned at all.","Chun, Paula chun a thiemna thu a hril a, “Judahai Dân chunga dâm, Pathien biekin thua dâm, Kaisar chunga dâm khawm, thil hrim hrim ka suksuol nawh,” a ta."
"But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?","Nisienlakhawm, Festa chun Judahai laia hmingṭhat a nuom a, Paula kuoma chun, “Jerusalema hang fea, khitaka ka hmaa i thu rêl i nuom am?” a ta."
"But Paul said, I am standing before Cæsar’s judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.","Paula ruok chun, “Kaisar rorêl- na ṭhungpha hmaah, ro rêlpêka ka umna ding hrima chun ngîr ka tih; Judahai chungah thil iengkhawm ka suksuol nawh, nang khawmin chu chu i hriet zing sih a."
"If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is true whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Cæsar.","Mi suol ka nia, thina khawp rau thil thaw ka ni chun, thi khawm ka sêl nawh; nisienlakhawm, hienghai mi hêkna thil hi a bul iengkhawm a um naw chun, tukhawmin an kuomah mi pe thei naw ni hai, Kaisar kuomah intlun ka tih,” a ta."
"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Cæsar: unto Cæsar shalt thou go.","Chun, Festa chun a rorêlpuitu- hai a biek rawn zoin, “Kaisar kuoma intlun i tum vei a, Kaisar kuomah fe mawl i tih,” tiin a dawn a."
"Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Cæsarea, and saluted Festus.","Chun, ni iengzât amani chena chun lal Agrippa le Berniki chu Kaisari an hung tlung a, Festa chibai an bûk a."
"And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;","Chun, ni tamtak chutaka chun an châm leiin Festa chun Paula thu- pawi chu lal kuoma chun a hril a, “Felik khan intâng tû amanih a mâksan a."
"about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for sentence against him.","Jerusalema ka um lai khan thiempu lalhai le Juda upahaiin a chungchâng thu an mi hril a, thiem- naw inchangtir dingin an ngên a."
"To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid against him.","Keiin an kuomah, ‘An ihêk le a hêktuhai an inhmaituok a, an hêkna kawngah a thiemna thu hril vena remchâng a hmu hmakhat chu, mi hrim hrim hrem dinga inthla hi Rom mi dân a ni nawh ie,’ tiin ka dawn a."
"When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.","Chun, hitaka an hung tlungin, sâwt riel loin, a zînga chun rorêlna ṭhungphaah ka ṭhung a, ama chu hung ṭhuoi dingin thu ka pêk a."
"Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;","Chun, a hêktuhai an ngîr laiin ka ring ang hrimin a chungah suolna thupawi an hril nawh a;"
"but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.","an sakhuo dânhai le, Isu mi pakhat thi tahnung, Paula chun, ‘A hring nâwk a nih,’ tiin a hril a; chuong ang a hril lei chun a chungah thubuoihai an lo nei a lo ni lem a."
"And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.","Kei chun, chuong thuhai chu ngaituo ngaina hrim ka hriet nawh a, Jerusalemah fe a, khitaka chuong thu chu rêlpêk a nuom le nuom naw kân dawn a."
"But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Cæsar.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chun, Laltak rêl dinga khêk a ngên ta lem a; chuleiin, Kaisar kuoma kân fetir thei hmakhat chu vêng dingin thu ka pêk a,” a ta."
"And Agrippa said unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.","Chun, Agrippa chun Festa kuoma chun, “Kei khawm chu thu hril chu ngai ka lo nuom rawp hlak hrim a nih,” a ta. Ama chun, “Zingah a thu hril ngai naw ti nîm,” a ta."
"So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.","Chuongchun, a zînga chun, Agrippa le Berniki chu ropuitakin an hung a, thu hrilna inah an hung lût a, sipai hotu lalhai leh, khuoa miṭha deu deuhai leh; chun, Festa thuin Paula an hung inṭhuoilûttir a."
"And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.","Chun, Festa chun, “Lal Agrippa le hitaka eini laia um po pohai, hi mipa hi in hmu hi a nih, a chungchâng thuah Judahai po poin, an rêngin hring ta lo dingin, khêk a, Jerusalema le hitaka an mi biekna kha a nih."
But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.,"Nisienlakhawm, thina khawp rauin iengkhawm a thaw nawh ti ka hriet a; amiruokchu, ama hin Laltak kuoma intlun a tum leiin tir ka tum a nih,"
"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.","nisienlakhawm, a thu mumal iengkhawm ka lal kuoma ziek ding ka hriet si nawh a. Chuleiin, in kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi suok hi, lal Agrippa, nanga hmaa hung ṭhuoi bîk deu khawm ka nih, suosal zoa ieng amani bêk ziek ding ka hmu theina dingin."
"For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.","Mi intâng Laltak kuoma tir a, a chunga an hêkna thu inhriettir sa naw chu, invêtthlâk niin ka hriet sih a,” a ta."
"And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:","Chun, Agrippa chun Paula kuoma chun, “I thiemna thu hril thei i tih,” a ta. Chun, Paula chun a kut a phar a, a thiemna thu a hril a,"
"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:","“Lal Agrippa, Judahaiin an mi hêkna po poa ka thiemna thu vawisûn hin i hmaa ka hril ding lei hin lâwmin kân hriet;"
especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.,"hi hi ka lâwmna tak chu a nih; Judahai laia dân le thubuoi po po kawnga i var ngawt lei hin; chuleiin, muongtaka mi ngai pêk dingin ka ngên che."
"My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;","A tîra, ka naupang laia inthawk ka chihai lai le Jerusalema ka um dân kha Judahai po poin an hriet a."
"having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.","A tîra inthawka ka chanchin an hriet a, khânga ei sakhuo pâwl kher- mei tak dân pângngaia Pharisaia ka um kha; an nuom phawt chun an mi hrilpui thei a nih."
And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;,"Chun, Pathienin ei thlatuhai kuoma thu a tiem kha beisei kawng thuah tuhin hitaka hin rorêlpêk dingin ka ngîr hi;"
"unto which promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!","chu thutiem chu, ei hnam sâwm le pahniin, a sûn a zâna Pathien rawng ṭhahnemngaitaka bâwlin hmu an beisei hlak. Aw, lalpa, chu beiseina lei chun Judahaiin an mi hêk a ni hi."
"Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?",“Pathienin mithihai a keitho ti hi iengdinga awium nawa in ruot am a na?
I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.,Kei khawmin Nazareth Isu hming kal zâwngin thil tamtak thaw lang ṭhain ka ring hlak a.
"And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.","Chuongang chu Jerusalemah ka thaw bawk hlak; chun, thiempu lalhai kuomah thu ka hmuh a, mi inthienghai laia mi tamtak intângna inah ka khum bawk hlak a; chun, an sukhlum laiin sukhlum remti tieng ka ṭhang bawk hlak a."
"And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.","Chun, inkhâwmna in tinah ka hrem rawp hlak a, Pathien inhril- siettir ka tum hrâm hlak a; an chungah ka rilo bêk bêk a, ram dang khuo chena khawm ka suknawmna hlak a."
"Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,","“Chuong ang thaw dingin, thiempu lalhai thu hmuin le, an tirna lekha chawiin, Damaskaah ka feh a;"
"at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.","chun, i aw, lalpa, ka fe laiin, sûnbu fâk pha a nih, vâna inthawkin var ieng amanih, nisa nêka var lem kei le ka fepuihai vêla chun varin ka hmuh a."
"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.","Chun, kan rêngin hnuoiah kan tluh a, Hebrai ṭawngin, ‘Saula, Saula, iengdinga nangin i mi suknawmna am a na? Sunna hmawl khêng chu i ta dingin a na ie,’ tiin râwl ka hriet a."
"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.","Chun, keiin, ‘Tu am i na Lalpa?’ ka ta. Lalpa chun, ‘Isu i suknawmnat hi ka nih."
"But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;","Nisienlakhawm, tho la, ngir rawh; hieng i thil hmuhai le, i kuoma ka inlarna ding thilhai leh chu rawngbâwla le hretua siem ding chein, i kuomah ka hung inlâr a ni hi."
"delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee,",Mi po po le Jentailhai kuta inthawkin sanhim ka ti che.
"to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.","An mit sukvar dingin an kuomah ka tir che hi, chuongchun, inthim chu var tieng nghatsan an ta, Setan thuneina chu Pathien tieng nghatsan an tih, suol ngaidamna an hmuna dingin le an mi ringna leia inthieng tahai kuomah ro chan an nei ve theina dingin,’ a ta."
"Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:","“Chuleiin, lal Agrippa, vâna mi inlâr chu ka sêl nawh a,"
"but declared both to them of Damascus first, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judæa, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.","a tîrin Damaskaa mihai kuomah, chu hnunga chun Jerusa- lema mihai kuoma dâm, Juda ram tina mihai kuoma dâm, Jentailhai kuoma dâm khawm sim hming inbûk tlâka thil thawa, sima, Pathien tieng an nghatna dingin ka hril lem hlak a nih."
"For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.","Chuong lei chun, Judahaiin Pathien biekinah an mi man a, mi sukhlum an tum a."
"Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;","Nisienlakhawm, Pathiena in- thawka ṭhangpuina ka hmu leiin vawisûn chenin mi chînhai le mi lienhai kuomah thu inhriettirin ka la um zing a, zâwlneihai le Mosiein hung tlung ding an ti thu chau naw chu thu dang hril loin;"
"how that the Christ must suffer, and how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.","khânga Krista chun rinum tuor a ta; chun, mithi laia inthawka a thonâwk leiin mi po po kuoma le Jentailhai kuoma khawm var inhmutirtu hmasatak nîng a tih, an ti thu kha,” a ta."
"And as he thus made his defence, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.","Chun, chuong anga a thiemna thu a hril laiin, Festa chun rawl inringtakin, “Paula, în vêt a nih, în chûk tamin a sukvêt che a nih,” a ta."
"But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chun, “Festa ṭhatak, kân vêt nawh ie; thu indiktak le thu vartak ka hril lem a ni hi."
"For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.","Hieng thu hi lal hin a hriet annâwm, a kuoma khawm ṭi loin ka hril hi; hieng thil hi a kuomah iengkhawm ip a ni nawh ti indiktakin ka hriet deh, hieng hi in kila thaw a ni si nawh a."
"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.","Lal Agrippa, zâwlneihai thu i awi am? I awi ti ka hriet,” a ta."
"And Agrippa said unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.","Chun, Agrippa chun Paula kuomah, “Sâwtnawtê chau mi thlêm a, Kristiena mi siem i tum a ni hi,” a ta."
"And Paul said, I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.","Paula chun, “Sâwt sienla, sâwt naw sienla, nang chau ka ti nawh a, vawisûna ka thu hretuhai po po khawm hi, keia ang bawka um dingin Pathien kuomah ka hni a nih, kawlhai ruok hi chu bun ve loin,” a ta."
"And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:","Chun, lal leh, Bawrsâp leh, Berniki le an kâwla ṭhunghai le chun an tho tâwl a;"
"and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.","chun, a tumin an feh a, an inbiek a, “Hi mipa hin thina le kawl bunna khawp rau iengkhawm thil a lo thaw luo naw hi,” an ta."
"And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cæsar.","Chun, Agrippain Festa kuom- ah, “Hi mipa hin Kaisar kuoma intlun lo tiem ta naw chu ni sienla, a suok el ding bah,” a ta."
"And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.","Chun, Itali rama lawnga kan fe ding an sukthlûk phingleh, Paula le mi intâng dang tuhai amanih,"
"And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.","Augusta pâwla mi sipai za hotu Julia an inkawltir a. Adramuttium khaw lawng Asia ram tuisuoriet panga khaw umhai sir dingah kan chuong a, tuisuorietah kan fe tah a; Makedonia rama mi Aristarka, Thessalonikaa mi kan kuomah a um a."
"And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.","A zîngah Sidon khuo kan sîr a, chun, Julia chun Paula a sukṭha hleh a, insukhar dingin a ruolhai kuomah ân lêng tir a."
"And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.","Chun, chutaka inthawkin, tuisuo- rietah kan fe nâwk a, thliin a ni naw tieng a mi nam leiin Kupra thlierkâr phên thli inupna tieng kan zâm a."
"And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.","Chun, Kilikia ram le Pamphulia ram dep tuisuoriet kan khêl hnungin, Lukia rama Mura khuo kan tlung a."
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.,"Chutaka chun sipai za hotu chun, Alexandria khaw lawng, Itali ram sir ding chu a hmuh a: chutaka chun a mîn chuongtir a."
"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;","Ni sâwt tak damtê têin kan feh a, Knidos khaw zâwn intak takin kan tlung hrâm a, thliin a mi dangkîr leiin Salmoni hrûlah Kret thlierkâr phên thli inupna tieng kan zâm a;"
and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.,"chun intak takin vapang kan hrût kan hrût a, likilkawi, Mawi an ti chu kan tlung tah a; chu kâwla chun Lasai khuo a um."
"And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,","chun, ni tamtak ân hmang ta lei le, lawnga fe ṭi a um ta leiin, (Bu nghei ni chu a lo khêl ta sih a), Paula chun anni chu ân fui a,"
"and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.","an kuomah, “Puhai, tuta lawnga fe hi sietna le bohmangna nasatak a tlung ding a nih ti ka hriet, thuomhnaw le lawng chunga chau ka ti nawh a; eini chunga khawm ka ti a nih,” a ta."
"But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.","Nisienlakhawm, sipai za hotu chun, Paula thu hril nêk chun lawngpu le lawng neitu thu hril a awi lem a."
"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there; which is a haven of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.","Chun, thlasik tuorna dingin likilkawi chu a rem naw leiin, a tam lemin chutaka inthawka tuisuorieta fe suoka, Phoiniki tlung hrâma, chutaka thlasik tuor an rawtpui a; Phoiniki chu Kret thlierkâra likil- kawi pakhat a nih, hmâr sak le sim sak sawng a nih."
"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.","Chun, sim thli chu damtê tea a hung hrâng phingle chun, an ditzâwng an hmu amanih an sâwn a, thîrchakai chu an khaisuok a, Kret thlierkâr pang chu an hrût an hrût a."
"But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:","Nisienlakhawm, sâwt nawtê hnunga chun khawmuol tienga chun thli natak a hung hrâng thla tah a, chu thli chu Eurokuilo an ti hlak."
"and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven.","Chun, lawng chu a hung nam fûk a, thli tieng ân nghat thei naw phingleh kan inthla tah a, a mi lên a mi lên el tah a."
"And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:","A hming Klauda thlierkâr chîtê phên thli inupna tieng chun kan zâm a, intak takin lawnglêng kan hum thei hrâm a."
"and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.","Chun, an keisuok hnungin ṭhangpuina hrui dâm an hmang a, lawng hnuoitieng an lâk vêt a, an khuop a. Puon zarna iengkim an sukthlûk a, chuong naw chun Surtia inlên lût an ṭih a, chuongchun, a mi lên a mi lên tah a."
"And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the freight overboard;","Chun, a zîngah tuifâwnin a mi vawr hrep lei chun, lawng thuom- hnaw chu tuiah an pei ṭan tah a."
and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.,A zîng nâwk chun anni kut ngeiin lawng thuomhnaw an pei suok nâwk tah a.
"And when neither sun nor stars shone upon us for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.","Chun, ni sâwttak nisa khawm, arasi khawm ân lang nawh a, thlipui namênin a mi nuoi nawh a, dam hrim kan inbeisei ta nawh a."
"And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.","Chun, bu fa loa sâwttak an um hnungin, Paula anni laiah a ngîr a; “Puhai, Kret thlierkâra khan sût loin, ka thu kha awi unla, hieng sietna le bohmangna hi in tlung naw ding bah."
"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.","Nisienlakhawm, tukhawm hin lungmuongtaka um dingin kân fui cheu, nangni lai tukhawmin in hringna inhmang naw ti niu, lawng ruok hi chu ân hmang ding a ni hi."
"For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,","A ta ka na, a rawng ka bâwl hlak Pathien kha, ama vântirko pakhat vawizân hin ka kâwlah a hung ngîr a, ka kuomah,"
"saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Cæsar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.","‘Paula, ṭi naw, Kaisar hmaah i ngîr ding a nih; chun, ngai rawh, lawnga i kuoma fehai po po khawm hi Pathienin a pêk che a nih,’ a mi ti a nih."
"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.","Chuleiin, Puhai, lungmuong- takin um ro; Pathien ka ring a, a mi hril ang peiin a um ding a nih."
But we must be cast upon a certain island.,"Chuleiin, thlierkâr ienga manih a mi lên suok ding a nih,” a ta."
"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:","Chun, Adria tuisuorietah thliin khing tieng khing tieng a mi lên a mi lên a, zân sâwm le pali a tling zân chun, zân ril vêlah lawng mihai chun khâwlai khawmuol amanih tlung dingin an inhriet a."
"and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.","Chuongchun, tui inthûkzie an inkhih a, hlam sâwmhni niin an hriet a; chun, sâwt nawtêah an inkhi nâwk a, hlam sâwm le panga niin an hriet a."
"And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.","Chun, lawng mei tieng thîr- chakai pali an thlâk a, chuong naw chun lungkho lai mi lên suok hlau rawi a tih, an tih a; chun, khuo var kâr an nghâkhla hle a."
"And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,","Chun, lawng mihai chun lawng lu tieng chun thîrchakaihai thlâk ding anga thaw tehlêmin, lawnglêng chu tuisuorietah an thlâk a, lawng chu tlân san an tum a."
"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.","Chu lai chun Paulain sipai za hotu le sipaihai kuoma chun, “Hienghai hi lawngah an um zing naw chun him thei naw ti niu,” a ta."
"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.","Chuongchun, sipaihai chun lawnglêng hruihai chu an ât tan a, an inthla tah a."
"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.","Chun, khawvar tâwm chun Paulain mi po po chu bu fa dingin a tir a, “Vawisûn hi ni sâwmpali a ni tah, iengkhawm fa loin in nghâk a, in nghei zing a nih."
Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.,"Chuleiin, bu fa dingin ka tir cheu hi; in damna ding a ni hi; nangni laia tukhawm a samzai pakhat khawm bohmang naw ni,” a ta."
"And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.","Chun, chu thu chu a hril zoin bei a lâk a, mi po po hmaa chun Pathien kuomah lâwmthu a hril tah a; chun, a khawi a, a fâk phut tah a."
"Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.","Anni khawm thlamuongtakin an um a, bu an fâk ve tah a."
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.,Lawnga mi chu kan rêngin za hni sâwmsari paruk kan nih.
"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.","Chun, an fâk khawp chun bu chu tuisuorietah an pei a, lawng an sukzâng deu a."
"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.","Chun, nisa a suok chun, khawmuol chu khâwlai am a ni an hriet nawh a; nisienlakhawm, khâwlai likilkawi amanih ṭieupho an hmuh a, chu chunga chun a thei chun lawng chu intlan suoktir an tum a."
"And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.","Thîrchakai thlungnahai chu an ât tan a, tuisuorietah an mâksan a; chu ruol chun a karherna khuop- nahai chu an sût a, hma tieng puon zar chu thli imût ding zawngin an khai sâng a; ṭieupho chu an pan tah a."
"But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.","Nisienlakhawm, tuihrât pahni intuokna hmunah kan lût hlau a, lawng chu hnuoi an insuktir tah a. Chuongchun, lawng lu tieng chu ân tâng tlat a, sukchâng ruol loin a um zing a, a mawngtieng ruok chu tuifâwn a nasat leiin a kawi ṭan tah a."
"And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.","Chun, sipaihaiin intânghai chu sukhlum an rawt a, chuong naw chun, tui inhlieu kai dâm um an ta, tlân hmang an tih ti an ṭih a."
"But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;","Nisienlakhawm, sipai za hotu chun Paula sanhim a nuom a, an thil tum chu a khap a. Tui inhlieu thei po tuisuorieta chun inchâwm thlâk a, khawmuol lo kai hmasa ding le,"
"and the rest, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.","mi danghai chu, a ṭhen thingphêk chunghaiah, a ṭhen lawng thuomhnaw dang chunghaiah kai dingin thu a pêk a. Chuong ang chun an rêngin khawmuolah himtakin an kai seng tah a."
"And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.","Chun, kan kai zo chun, thlierkâr hming chu Malta a nih ti kan hriet tah a."
"And the barbarians showed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.","Chu ram mihai chun lunginsiet namênin an mi lo lunginsiet nawh a; ruo a hung sûr lei le a dei leiin mei an sêm a, kan rêngin an mi lo lâwm a."
"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.","Chun, Paula chun thing têl khat ân khâwm a, meia chun a tih a, a lum leiin rûl a hung suok a, a kutah a chuk a, a kawp zing a."
"And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.","Chun, chu ram mihai chun thilhring a kuta inkhai zing chu an hmu chun, “Hi mipa hi tuolthattu a ni phawt el, tuisuorieta inthawkin tlân suok sienla khawm, Phuba latu chun a dam a awi ta naw a ni hi,” an ta."
"Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun thilhring chu meiah a thinthlâk a, iengkhawm a ti nawh a."
"But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.","Anni ruok chun ân vûng amanih, kârloa thia a tlûk nghâl amanih an ring a; chun, sâwttak an nghâk zing a, iengkhawm a ti nawh ti an hriet chun an lungril an inlet a, “Pathien a ni hi,” an ti ta lem a."
"Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius; who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.","Chun, chu hmun kâwla chun chu thlierkâra laltak a hming Publia ram a um a, ama chun a mi lo lâwm a, ni thum lâwmtakin a mîn tlungtir a."
"And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.","Chun, Publia pa chu khawsik le santên invawiin a lo zâl zing a; chun, Paula a kuomah a lût a, a ṭawngṭai a, a chungah a kuthai ân nghat a, a sukdam tah a."
"And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:","Chu chu a thaw zo chun, chu thlierkâra natna nei po chu an hung a, an dam tâwl tah a; chuhai chun nasatakin an mi chawimawi a,"
"who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.","chun, kan fe dingin kan ma- mawhai chu lawngah an sie tâwl a."
"And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.","Chun, thla thum chenah a hming Dioskuri, Alexandria khaw lawng, thlasika thlierkâra um tah, chu lawnga chun kan fe tah a."
"And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.","Chun, Surakus kan sir a, chutaka chun ni thum kan châm a."
"And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;","Chutaka inthawkin kan fe kuol a, Regium kan tlung a; chun, ni khat chenah sim thli a hung hrâng a, a zîng nâwk chun Puteoli kan tlung nâwk a."
"where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.","Chutaka chun unauhai kan hmuh a, an kuoma ni sari châm dingin an mi thlêm a; chuong ang chun Rom tieng kan fe ta pei a."
"And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.","Chun, unauhaiin kan chanchin an hriet phingleh chutaka inthawk chun Appia Dâwr le Khuolbûk pathum chenah mi tuok dingin an hung a; anni chu a hmu chun Pathien kuomah Paulain lâwmthu a hril a, ân sukhuoi tah a."
"And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.","Chun, Roma kan lût chun, Paula chu a vêngtu sipai kuomah a khât chaua um an phal a."
"And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:","Chun, ni thum chenah Paula chun Judahai hotuhai deu deu a ko khâwm a; chun, an hung inkhâwmin, an kuomah, “Unauhai, mi po po le ei thlatuhai dân chungah iengkhawm ka thaw naw khawmin Jerusalema inthawkin Roma mihai kuomah an mîn tângtir a nih."
"who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.",Anni chun an mi suosal zoin thina khawp meu ka chungah iengkhawm a um naw leiin mîn suo an tum a.
"But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin chu chu an sêl leiin Kaisar kuomah intlun naw thei ka ni ta nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ka chihai hêkna neia thaw ka ni nawh."
For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.,"Chuong kawnga chun nangni inhmupui ding cheuin le inbiekpui ding cheuin ka ko cheu a nih; Israelhai beisei kân ṭâwmpui leia hi khaidiet hi bun ka ni sih a,” a ta."
"And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judæa concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I chanchin Judai rama inthawkin lekhahaiin kan hmu si nawh a, unau- hai hitaka hungin tukhawmin i chunga thupawi an hrilsuok si nawh, phuong khawm an phuong bawk nawh."
"But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.","Nisienlakhawm, hi pâwl hi ram tinah hrilsiet a ni sih a, nangin ieng- tin am i ngai a hriet kan nuom,” an ta."
"And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded the matter, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.","Chun, ni an tiem a, chu ni chun a tlung inah mi tamtak a kuomah an hung a, zîngkâra inthawkin zântieng chenin an kuomah chu thu chu a hrilfie a, Pathien ram thu ân hriettir a, Mosie Dân Lekhabu thu le Zâwlneihai Lekhabu thuin Isu tieng anni a thlêm a thlêm a."
"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.","Chun, a ṭhenin a thu hril chu an ring a, a ṭhen chun an ring nawh a."
"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,","An inngei ta nawh a, Paulain thu baukhat a hril zoin an suok tah a. A thu hril chu hi hi a nih: — “Thlarau Inthiengin zâwlnei Isai bauin in thlatuhai kuoma a hril kha ân dik ngawt el,"
"saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:","Hi chihai kuoma hin va hril rawh: ‘Na chun chu hre de ti niu a, a ngaina ruok chu hre tawp naw ti niu, Hmu chu hmûng in ta, hriet chu hre tawp naw ti niu;"
"For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.","Hi chihai lungril hi a lo ngawng tah a, An nahai a lo sêt deu a, An insîm bawk a, Chuong naw chun ei mitin hmûng ei ta, Ei nain hrieng ei ta, Ei lungrilin hre bawk ei ta, Ngha kîr nâwk rawi ei ta, Amain mi sukdam hlau rawi a tih,’ an tih a,” a ti kha."
"Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.","“Chuongchun, Pathien sandam- na thu hi Jentailhai kuomah inphur a nih ti hi hre ro, anni chun chu ngai khawm ngai an tih,” a ta."
,"[Chuongchun, hieng thuhai hi a hril zo chun, Judahai chu an ṭin a, anni le anni nasatakin an insêl a.]"
"And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,","Chun, Paula chu kum hni pumhlûm ama in hawah a um a, a kuoma lût taphawt a lâwm hlak a,"
"preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.","Pathien ram thu a hril a, Lal Isu Krista thu khawm huoitakin ân chûktir hlak, tukhawmin ama an khap si nawh a."
"Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.","Chun, Peter le Johan chu chawhnung inher, ṭawngṭai hun lai chun, Pathien biekina lût ding chun an hang feh a."
"And a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;","Chun, patling tu amanih a pieng tira inthawka ke inbai an hung zâwn a, ama chu biekina lûthai kuoma kut daw dingin, biekin kawtkhâr, “Maawi,” an ti bula chun, ni tin an inzâltir hlak a."
"who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.","Ama chun Peter le Johan Pathien biekina lût ding chu a hmuh a, kut a dawh a."
"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.","Chun, Peter le Johanin ama chu an en zing a. Peterin, “Keini mi hang en ta,” a ta."
"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.","Ama chun an kuoma inthawka ieng amanih hmu a beisei a, a hang en a."
"But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin, “Tang- ka le rângkachak iengkhawm ka nei nawh; nisienlakhawm, ka nei sun pêng ka ti che; Nazareth Isu Krista hmingin kein lâwn ta rawh,” a ta."
"And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength.","A kut changtieng a chel a, a keitho tah a. Chun, kârloin a kehai le a kemit ruhai chu a hung hrât nghâl tah a."
"And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.","Chun, ama chu ân châwm tho a, a ngîr a, a kein a lâwn phut tah a. Kea lâwn lâwn le, inchâwm le, Pathien inpâk pum peiin biekina chun a lût ve tah a."
And all the people saw him walking and praising God:,"Chun, keâ lâwn le Pathien ân pâk chu mi po poin an hmuh a;"
"and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.","biekin kawtkhâr, Mawi, bula kut dawa ṭhung hlak kha a nih ti an hriet a; a chunga thil tlung chu mak an ti bêk bêk a, an buoi hle el a."
"And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.","Chun, ama chun Peter le Johan chu a chel zing laiin, mi po poin mak an ti bêk bêk a, Solomon tuolpûk an tia chun, an kuomah an hung tlân khâwm a."
"And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?","Peterin chu chu a hmu chun, mihai chu a biek a, “Nangni Israel mihai, hieng hi iengdinga mak in ti am a na?

"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.","Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai Pathien, ei thlatuhai Pathien chun, a siehlaw Isu chu a chawimawi ta a ni hi; ama chu in inmantir a, Pilatin insuo a tum khawmin a hmaah in lo dit naw kha."
"But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you,","Mi inthieng le feltak kha in dit nawh a, tuolthattu kha in kuoma pêk in ngên ta lem a."
and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.,"Hringna Siemtu chu in that a; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ama chu mithi laia inthawkin a keitho nâwk tah; chu chu a hretuhai kan nih."
"And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.","Chun, ama hming ring leiin, a hming chun hi mipa in hmu le in hriet hlak hi a sukhrât tah a nih; anih, ama leia ringna hung um hin, in rênga mithmuah a sukdam var tah a ni hi."
"And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.","“Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, in hotuhai khawmin an inmâwl leia an thaw ang khan, in inmâwl leiin hieng hi in thaw a nih ti ka hriet."
"But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin zâwlnei po po bauah, Krista chun rinum a tuor ding thu ân hriettir lâwk kha; khâng ang khan ân tlungtir ta lem a nih."
"Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;","Chuleiin, in suolhai thâibo a ni theina dingin sim unla, ngha kîr nâwk ro,"
"and that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, even Jesus:","chuongchun, Lalpa kuoma in- thawka har hunhai la hung tlung thei a tih, Krista Isu, in ta dinga a iruot khawm kha hung tir thei a tih."
"whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old.","Amiruokchu, iengkim siem ṭhat hun a tlung hmakhat chu vânin ama chu a la kawl hri ding a nih; chu siem ṭhat ding thu chu Pathienin leihnuoi insieng tira inthawk a zâwlnei inthieng umhai bauin a hril ta kha."
"Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me; to him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.","Mosie ngeiin, Lalpa Pathienin kei a mi siem ang hin in unauhai lai zâwlnei pakhat siempêk a ti cheu.

"And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.","Chun, mi tûkhawm, chu zâwlnei thu chu ngai naw taphawt chu, mi laia inthawk sukbohmang dai nîng an tih,” a ti kha."
"Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.","Anih, Samuel um chena in- thawk zâwlnei po po, an hnunga mihai leh, thu hril taphawt kha, tulai chanchin hi an hril lâwk bawk hlak."
"Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.","Nangni hi zâwlneihai le thu- thlung nauhai in nih, Pathienin Abraham kuomah, “ ‘I thlahai leiin khawvêla hnam tin thawveng an tih,’ tiin in thlatuhai kuomah a tiem kha."
"Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.","Pathienin a Siehlaw chu a ruot a, in suolhai innghatsantir seng cheua mal sâwmpêk ding cheuin, nangni kuomah a hung tir hmasa tak a ni hi,” a ta."
"And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,","Chun, Peter le Johanin mihai kuomah thu an hril leiin, thiempuhai, biekin hotuhai, Saddu- kaihai chu an kuom an hung tlung phut a."
"being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.",Mi an inchûktir le Isu leiin mithi laia inthawka thonâwk thu an hril leiin an lungninaw bêk bêk a.
"And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.","Chun, an man a, zântieng a ni leiin a zîng chena dingin intângna inah an khum tah a."
But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.,"Nisienlakhawm, thu ngaihai a ṭhen tamtakin an awi a; an tam tieng chu patling ruok khawm sâng nga lai an tling a."
"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;","Chun, a zînga chun an hotuhai, upahai, Dân inchûktirtuhai, Jeru- salemah an um khâwm a,"
"and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.","Thiempu Laltak Anna hai, Kaia- pha hai, Johan hai, Alexandra hai, Thiempu Laltak chihai po po le chun."
"And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?","Chun, Peter le Johan chu a laiah an inngîrtir a, “Ieng thuneinain am, tu hmingin am hieng hi in thaw a?” an ta, an indawn a."
"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,","Chuongchun, Peter chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, an kuomah, “Mi po po hotuhai, upahai,"
"if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;","mi hrâtnaw sukṭhat thuah, ‘Hi mipa hi ieng leiin am a hung dam tah a?’ tiin vawisûn hin in mi fie a ni chun,"
"be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even in him doth this man stand here before you whole.","nangni po poin hre ro, Israel mi po khawmin hre raw se, Nazareth Isu Krista krawsa in hemde Pathienin mithi laia inthawka a ikeitho nâwk kha, ama hming ngeiin hi mipa hi hitaka hin in hmaah damin a ngîr tah a ni hi."
"He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.","Nangni in bâwltuhai, in lung dehâwn, a kia lung ṭhangkaitak lo ni ta kha ama hi a nih."
"And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.","Mi dang tu kuoma khawm san- damna a um nawh; vânkhuphnuoia mihriem isak lai, a mi sandam ding hming dang hrim a um nawh,” a ta."
"Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.","Chun, Peter le Johan huoizie chu an hmu chun lekha thiemnaw le mi narân el an nih ti an hrietin, mak an ti hleh a; Isu kuomah an um tah ti an hriet tah a."
"And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.","Chun, mi an sukdam chu an kâwla ngîr an hmuh a, iengkhawm an sawisêl thei si nawh."
"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,","Chuongchun, an rorêlnaa in- thawk a an infetir hnungin an inrawn a,"
"saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.",“Hieng mihai hi iengtin am thâwng ei ta? Thilmak inthangtak an thaw ti Jerusalema um po poin an hriet ta hi; eini khawmin ei sêl thei si nawh a.
"But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.","Nisienlakhawm, mi kuoma ân phuong nâwk zuol nawna dingin, tuta inthawk tû kuoma khawm hi hminga thu an hril nawna dingin vau ei tiu,” an ta."
"And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.","Chuongchun, anni chu an ko a, Isu hminga thu hril dêr lo ding an ti tlat a."
"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:","Nisienlakhawm, Peter le Johan- in an kuomah, “Pathien mithmuin, Pathien thu zâwm nêkin nangni thu zâwm ân dik lem am chu, ngaituo ro."
for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.,"Keini chu thil kan hmu le kan hriethai kha hril loin kan um thei nawh,” an ta."
"And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.","Chun, anni chun an vau nâwk zuol a, an insuo tah a. Mipui leiin hremna remchâng an hmu nawh; an thilthaw lei khan mi po poin Pathien an chawimawi sih a."
"For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.",Thilmaka an isukdam chu kum sâwmli nêk hmana ta m lem a ni sih a.
"And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.","Chun, Peter le Johan chu an suok chun anni pâwlhai lai an va feh a; thiempu lalhai le upahaiin an kuoma an hril po chu an hril vawng a."
"And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:","Chuongchun, a ngaihai chun a ruolin rawl inringtakin Pathien kuomah, “Lalpa, nang hnuoi hai, vân hai, tuisuoriet hai, a sûnga um po pohai siemtu i nih;"
"who by the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?","nangin Thlarau Inthiengin, kan thlatu i siehlaw David bauin, hieng thu hi i hril a nih:- ‘Jentailhai iengdinga an lunginsen am? Hnam tinin iengdinga thil teplo an ngaituo am a na?"
"The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:","Khawvêl lalhaiin an ep huoi huoi a, Hotuhai khawm an pung khâwm a, Lalpa le a Krista chunga chun,’ tiin."
"for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,","“Hi khuoa hin i siehlaw in- thieng, i hriek nâl, Isu chunga khan Herod le Pontia Pilat le, Jentailhai le Israel mihai an pungkhâwm tak zet a nih;"
to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel foreordained to come to pass.,i kut le i lungrilin tlung dinga i ruot lâwk taphawt kha thaw dingin.
"And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,","Chuongchun, tuhin Lalpa, an mi vauzie hi ngai ta; i suokhai hi huoitakin i thu inhriltir la,"
while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.,"mihai sukdam dingin i kut phar bawk rawh; i siehlaw inthieng Isu hmingin inchikna le thilmakhai inthawtir bawk rawh,” an ta."
"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.","Chun, an ṭawngṭai zo chun an umna in chu a hung inhnîng a, an rêngin Thlarau Inthiengin an hung sip a, huoitakin Pathien thu an hril tah a."
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.,"Chun, a ringtu mipuihai chu lungril hmunkhat le ngaituo hmun- khatin an um a; anni laia pakhat khawmin an sum nei, “Ka ta bîk a nih,” an ti nawh; thil po po an inṭâwm lem hlak."
And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.,"Chun, tirkohai chun awium- takin Lal Isu thonâwk thu an inhriettir hlak a, an rênga chungah lunginsietna nasatak a um."
"For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,","Chun, anni lai khawm tlasam tukhawm an um nawh, hnuoihai, inhai nei taphawtin an zawr a, an thil zawrhai chu a man an hung chawi a,"
"and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.",tirkohai ke bulah an sie hlak a; an mamaw dai tâwk sengin an sem seng hlak.
"And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,","Chun, Josef, tirkohaiin Barna- ba an ti chu, (chu hming umzie chu “Thlamuongna nau,” tina a nih), Levi chi, Kupra thlierkâra mi a na,"
"having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.","a lo nei chu zawrin a man a hung chawi a, tirkohai ke bulah a sie tah a."
"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,","Nisienlakhawm, mi pakhat a hming Anania a nuhmei Saphira leh an um a, Anania chun hnuoi a zawr a, a nuhmei hrietin a man a ṭhen a ip tah a."
"and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.","Chun, a ṭhen a hung chawi a, tirkohai ke bula chun a sie a."
"But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin, “Ana- nia, Thlarau Inthieng hlêm ding le, hnuoi man a ṭhen ip dingin iengdinga Setanin I lungril a suksip am a na?"
"While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.","A um sûng po khan i ta a ni zing a ni naw am a nih? I zawr hnung khawm khan a man chu i thu thua um a ni naw am a nih? Iengdinga hieng thu hi i lungrila i ngaituo am a na? Mihriem hlêm i ni nawh a, Pathien kuoma khêl hril i ni lem,” a ta."
And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it.,"Chun, Anania chun chuong thu chu a hriet phingleh a tluh a, a thi tah a; chun, a hre taphawt chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
"And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.","Chun, tlangvâlhai chu an tho a, an tuom a, an zâwn suok a, an phûm tah a."
"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.","Chun, dârkar thum lai hnunga chun, a nuhmei chu thil umzie chu hre loin a hung lût a."
"And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much.","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Mi hril rawh, Hnuoi chu hieng zât char hin maw in zawr?” a ta. Ama chun, “Uou, hieng zât char hin a nih,” a ta."
"But Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Ieng- dinga Lalpa Thlarau infiena dinga in inthuruol am? Ngai ta, i pasal phûmtuhai kepha chu kawtkhâr bulah a hung um tah, nang khawm zâwn dawk an ti che,” a ta."
"And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.","Chun, kârloin a ke bula chun a tlu nghâl tah a, a thi ve tah a; chun, tlangvâlhai chu an hung lût a, ama chu a thisain an hung hmuh a, an zâwn dawk a, a pasal kâwla chun an phûm tah a."
"And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.","Chun, kohranhai po po le chuong thu hre taphawt chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people: and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.,"Chun, mi lai Pathienin tirkohai kutin inchikna le thilmak tamtak a thaw hlak. Annirawi chu an rêngin lungril hmunkhatin Solomon Tuol- pûka chun an inkhâwm hlak."
But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them;,"Mi dang ruok chu tukhawm anni lai an ṭhang ve ngam ta nawh; nisienlakhawm, anni chu miin an inpâk hlak."
"and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women:","Chun, a ring tharhai nuhmei le pasal tamtakin Lalpa kuoma chun an hung belsa nâwk zuol hlak a."
"insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.","Chuongchun, mi damnawhai khawm kawtthlêrhaiah an zâwn dawk a, khumahai, puonphaahai an inzâltir a, “Peter fe malamin a hlimin a ṭhen bêk a hlie theina dingin,” an ta."
"And there also came together the multitude from the cities round about Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.","Chun, Jerusalem kâwl vêl khuoa inthawkin mipuihai khawm chu damnawhai, khawhri inthieng- naw isawisakhai hung ṭhuoiin an hung khâwm a; chuonghai khawm chu an hung dam ta seng a."
"But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,","Chun, thiempu Laltak le a ruolhai po po an hung inthawk a, (chuong a ruolhai chu Saddukai pâwl an nih,) an îtthîk bêk bêk a,"
"and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.","tirkohai chu an man a, vântlâng intângna inah an khum tah a."
"But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpa vântirko pakhatin, kawtkhârhai chu a hung hawng a, a ṭhuoi suok tah a,"
"Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.","“Pathien biekinah va ngîr unla, mi kuomah hieng hringna thu po po hi va hril ro,” a ta."
"And when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.","Chun, chu thu chu an hrietin khawvar hun vêla chun Pathien biekinah an va lût a, an inchûktir a. Nisienlakhawm, Thiempu Laltak le a ruolhai chu an hung a, rorêltuhai le Israel thlahai upahai po po an ko khâwm a, tirkohai chu hung inṭhuoitir dingin intângna ina chun mi an tir a."
"But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told,","Nisienlakhawm, manmihai chu an va tlung chun intângna ina chun anni chu an hmu si nawh; chuong- chun, an kîr nâwk a,"
"saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.","“Intângna in chu himtaka inkhârin, a vêngtuhai khawm kawt- khâr bula ngîrin kan hmu sih a; nisienlakhawm, kan hei hawng a, a sûngah tukhawm kan hmu si nawh,” tiin an hril a."
"Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow.","Chun, Pathien biekin hotu le thiempu lalhaiin chuong thu chu an hrietin, “Hieng hi iengtin tak inphuong a ti maw?” tiin an thua chun an lunginzîng ta bêk bêk a."
"And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.","Chun, mi pakhat a hung a, an kuomah, “Ngai ta u, intângna ina mi inkhumhai khan Pathien biekinah ngîrin mi an inchûktir ka ti!” tiin an hung hril a."
"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them, but without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.","Chuongchun, hotu chu manmi- hai le chun an va feh a, vântlâng an ṭi leiin tlangtakin an hung ṭhuoi a, chuong naw chun lunga dêng an ṭih a."
"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,","Chun, an hung ṭhuoi tlung chun rorêltuhai hmaa chun an inngîrtir a. Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun an kuomah,"
"saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.","“Hi hming hin inchûktir lo ding kan ti tlat ta cheu kha; hre ro, in thu inchûktirin Jerusalem in suksip vawng ta hi; chu mipa sukhlum bul chu mîn tumtir in tum a ni hi,” tiin a suosal a."
"But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter le tirko- hai chun, “Mihriem thu nêkin Pathien thu kan zâwm lem ding a nih."
"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.","Nangnîn Isu thinga khaikângin in sukhlum kha, ei thlatuhai Pathienin a keitho nâwk tah a nih."
"Him did God exalt with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.","Ama ngei kha Pathienin Lal le Sandamtua um dingin a changtieng a chawimawi tah, Israelhai suol insim- tir ding le ngaidam dingin."
"And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.","Chuong thu chu, a hretuhai kan ni hi, Thlarau Inthieng, Pathienin a thu zâwm taphawthai kuoma a pêk kha, a hretu a ni ve bawk a,” an ta, an dawn a."
"But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were minded to slay them.","Chun, anni chun chuong thu chu an hrietin an lungril a khei tah a, sukhlum an tum tah a."
"But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.","Nisienlakhawm, rorêltuhai lai chun, a hming Gamaliel, Pharisai, Dân hretu, mi po po laia hminginthangtak, mi pakhat chu a ngîr a, chuhai chu insuoktir phawt dingin thu a pêk a."
"And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do.","Chun, rorêltuhai kuoma chun, “Nangni Israel mihai, hihai chunga in thil thaw tum hi fîmkhur ro."
"For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought.","Tuta hma khawm khan, Theo- da, ‘Mi lien ka nih,’ tiin a hung um a, chu mipa kuoma chun mi tamtak, za li lai an lo kawp a. Ama chu sukhlumin a um tah a; a thu zâwm taphawt chu an rêngin an indar ta vawng a, iengkhawm an ni ta nawh."
"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment, and drew away some of the people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.","Chu mipa um hnung chun, hming ziek lai khan Galili rama mi Juda kha a hung um nâwk a, a kuomah mi ṭhenkhat a hîp nâwk a, nisienlakhawm, ama chu a thi tah a, a thu zâwm taphawt chu an rêngin an indar ta vawng a."
"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown:","Chuleiin, tuhin ka ti cheu hi, hieng mihai hi tâwk naw unla, um el raw hai se; hieng an thil thaw tum le an thilthaw hi mihriem ithaw suok el a ni chun bohmang a tih;"
"but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God.","amiruokchu, Pathien ithaw suok a ni chun anni sukbohmang thei naw ti niu; chuong naw chun, Pathien do ni hlau rawi in tih,” a ta. Chun, a hril chu rem an ti tah a."
"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.","Chuongchun, tirkohai chu an ko a, an vuok a, chu zo chun Isu hminga thu hril lo ding ti tlatin an insuo tah a."
"They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.","Chuongchun, rorêltuhai laia inthawk chun an suok a, chu hming leia muolphona tuor tlâka ruot an ni leiin an lâwm hleh a."
"And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus as the Christ.","Chun, ni tin Pathien biekina le anni inahai, “Isu chu Krista a nih,” tiin inchûktir le hril an ma nawh."
"Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.","Chun, chuong laia inchûktirhai an pung an pung lai chun, an ni tin thil sema chun an hmeithaihai an ngaisak naw leiin Juda, Grik ṭawng hmanghai chu Juda, Hebrai ṭawng hmanghai chungah an lo chier tah a."
"And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables.","Chun, sâwm le pahnihai chun inchûktir mipuihai chu an ko a, “Pa- thien thu hril bân sanin, dawkânahai rawng kan bâwl chun ṭha naw nih."
"Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.","Chuongchun, unauhai, nangni laia varna le Thlaraua sip mi hming ṭha ruok pasari thlang ro; anni chu hieng thil rêltu ding hin siem ei tih."
"But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.","Keini ruok chu ṭawngṭai le thu rawngbâwlin um tlat kan tih,” an ta."
"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaüs a proselyte of Antioch;","Chuong thu chun mipui po po chu a suklâwm a; chuongchun, Stephan, ringna le Thlarau Inthienga sip le, Philip, Prokor, Nikanor, Timon, Parmena le Nikol Judahai saphun Antiokei mi leh an thlang a."
"whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.","Chuhai chu tirkohai hmaa chun an inngîrtir a, chun, anni chu an ṭawngṭai a, an chungah an kut an innghat a."
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.,"Chun, Pathien thu chu a hung indar a; Jerusalema inchûktirhai an pung ta bêk bêk a; thiempu laia khawm mi tamtak chu ringna awi mi an ni tah a."
"And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.","Chun, Stephan chu zaidamna le thilthawtheinain a sip a, mi lai thilmak le inchikna ropuitak a thaw hlak a."
"But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.","Nisienlakhawm, Sal suokhai, Kurinia mi dâm, Alexandra khuoa mi dâm, inkhâwmna an tia mi ṭhenkhat leh, Kiliki rama mi dâm, Asia ram mi inkhâwmna ina mi ṭhenkhathai an hung inthawk a, Stephan chu an hung sêl a."
And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.,"Nisienlakhawm, a varna le a hrilpuitu Thlarau chu an letthlâk thei nawh a."
"Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.","Chun, mihai an tham a; chuhai chun, “Mosie le Pathien a hrilsiet kan hriet,” an ta."
"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council,","Chun, mihai, upahai, Dân inchûktirtuhai, an infui a, Stephan an thawh a, an man a, rorêltuhai kuomah an ṭhuoi a."
"and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:","Chun, hretu tehlêmhai an siem a, chuhai chun, “Hi mipa hin In Inthieng le Dân hi a hrilsiet rawp hlak a;"
"for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.","hi Nazareth Isu hin hi In hi ṭhiek a ta, Mosien dân a mi pêkhai kha sukdanglam a tih tiin a hril kan hriet,” an ta."
"And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.","Chun, rorêltuhai ṭhung po po chun Stephan an en zing a, a hmêl chu vântirko hmêl angin an hmuh a."
"And the high priest said, Are these things so?","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun, “Hieng thu hi ân dik am?” a ta."
"And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,","Chun, Stephan chun, “Unauhai, pahai ngai ta u, ei thlatu Abraham Harana a um hmaa, Mesopotamia rama a um lai khan Ropuina Pathien chu a kuomah a hung inlâr a,"
"and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.","a kuomah, ‘I khuo tieng le i chihai laia inthawkin suok la, ram ka lân entir ding che tieng chun fe rawh,’ a ta."
"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, God removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell:","Chun, ama chu Kaldaihai rama inthawkin a suok a, Haranah a va um tah a; chun, a pa a thi hnungin chutaka inthawkin hi tuta in umna khuo tieng hin Pathienin ân pêm lûttir a."
"and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.","Chun, hitaka hin chu iengkhawm hmun hluo ding, a ke innghatna khawp khawm a pêk nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ama le a hnunga a thlahai chena ro dingin pêk a tiem a, nau a la nei hma ngei khawmin."
"And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.","“Chun, Pathienin hieng ang hin a hril:- ‘A thlahai mi khuo tieng kum za li thang an tih, miin suokah siem an ta,suknawmna bawk an tih,’ tiin."
"And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.","Chun, Pathienin, ‘Suoka neitu ding hnam chu keiin la ngaituong ka tih, chun,chu zoa chun hung suok an ta, hi hmuna hin ka rawng la bâwl an tih,’ a ti bawk a."
"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.","Chun, Pathienin a kuomah ser- tan thu kha a thlung a, chuongchun, Abraham chun, Isak a hung nei a, a ni riet niah a ser a tan a; chun Isak chun Jakob a nei a, Jakob chun chi thlatu sâwm le pahnihai kha a hung nei tah a."
"And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,","“Chun, chi thlatuhai khan Josef an îtthik a, Aigupta tieng an zawr a, nisienlakhawm, Pathien a kuomah a um a."
"and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.","A rinum tuor po poah a san suok pei a, Aigupta ram lal Pharao khawm ân lunginsiettir a, mi vartak a ni ti ân hriettir bawk a. Chuongchun, ama chun Aigupta ram le a ina mi po po chungah hotuin a siem tah a."
"Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.","“Chun, Aigupta le Kanaan ram po poa chun ṭâm a hung tlah a, rinum nasatak a hung tlung tah a; ei thlatuhai chun fâk ding hrim hrim an hmu ta nawh a."
"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.","Nisienlakhawm, Jakob chun Aiguptaah bu a um ti a hriet phingleh ei thlatuhai chu a tir suok a; chu chu an fe phutna tak a nih."
And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.,"Chun, an fe a vawi hninaa chun, Josef chu a unauhai kuoma chun ân hriettir a, chun Josef unauhai chu Pharao an inhriettir tah a."
"And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.","Chun, Josef chun a pa Jakob le a unau po po ân kotir a; anni chu sâwmsari le panga an nih."
"And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;","Chuongchun, Jakob chu Ai- gupta ramah a zu feh a, chutaka chun ama le ei thlatuhai chu an thi tah a,"
"and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.","Sekem khuo an zâwn tlung a, Abrahamin Sekem khuoa Hamor naupahai kuoma thlân, tangka suma a inchâwka khan an phûm tah a."
"But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,","“Chun, Pathienin Abraham kuoma thu a tiem kha a hung tlung hun chu a tlung dingin, mihai chu Aiguptaa chun an pung a, an tam ta deu deu a,"
"till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.",Josef hre naw lal dang a hung um chen khan.
"The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.","Ama chun ei chihai chu a zai- hlêm a, a suknawmna a, an nautêhai dam lo dingin ân pei suoktir hlak."
"At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house:","Chu lai chun, Mosie a hung pieng a, a hmêl a ṭha bêk bêk a, a pa inah thla thum an châwm a."
"and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.","Chun, an pei suok chun Pharao naunu chun a lâk a, ama nau dingin a châwm tah a."
And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.,"“Chun, Mosie chu Aigupta mihai varna po po an inchûktir a, a thu le a thilthawah a ropui bêk bêk a."
"But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.","Chun, ama chu kum sâwmli a tling ding vêlin a unau Israel thlahai chu kan a tum a."
"And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian:","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat sukrinum tuor lai a hmuh a, a san a, suknawmnatna tuortu phuba chu a lâk a, Aigupta mi chu a sukhlum tah a."
and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.,"Mosie chun ama kutin Pa- thienin anni a sanhim ding ti a unauhaiin an hriet amanih a ta, nisienlakhawm, an hriet si nawh."
"And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?","Chun, a zîngah anni laia mi pahni an insuol laiin an kuom a hung tlung a, ‘Puhai, unau in nih annâwm; iengdinga indiknawtakin in inthaw am?’ tiin anni rem a tum a."
"But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?","Nisienlakhawm, a ruolpa chunga a kawmawpa lem chun Mosie a nampei a, ‘Kan chungah rorêltu le hotuin tuin am a siem cheh a?"
"Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?","Zânita Aigupta mi i sukhlum ang khan, mi sukhlum i tum a ni maw?’ a ta."
"And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.","Chun, chu thu lei chun Mosie a tlân hmang a, Median ramah a thang zing a, chutaka chun naupasal pahni a nei a."
"And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.","Chun, kum sâwmli a tling hnungin Sinai tlâng thlalêrah chîmbukah meichawk lai vântirko pakhat a kuomah ân lâr a."
"And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,","Chun, Mosiein a hmu chun, a thil hmu chu mak a ti êm a; chun, en dinga a va hnai laiin, Lalpa rawlin,"
"I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.","‘Kei i thlatuhai Pathien ka nih, Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien chu,’ a lo tih a. Chuongchun, Mosie chu ân thin a, a en ngam ta nawh a."
"And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.","Chun, Lalpa chun a kuomah, ‘I kephaa inthawkin i kekawk kha sût rawh, i ngîrna hmun kha hnuoi inthieng a nih."
"I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.","Aiguptaa ka mi umhai chu an rimsikzie ka hmu zing a, anni sanhim dingin ka hung ṭum a nih. Hung ta, Aiguptaah tir ka ti che,’ a ta."
"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.","“Chu Mosie, ‘Hotu le rorêltu dingin tuin am a siem cheh a?’ tia an sêl chu, chîmbuka vântirko a kuoma inlâr khan a ṭhangpui a, Pathienin ama ngei chu hotu le sanhimtu ni fâwm dingin a tir a nih."
"This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.","Ama chun Aiguptaa dâm, Tuisuoriet Sena dâm, thlalêra dâm chun kum sâwmli sûngin thilmak le inchiknahai inhmutirin anni a ṭhuoi suok tah a."
"This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me.","“Israel thlahai kuomah ‘Pa- thienin kei a mi siem ang hin, in unauhai laia mi zâwlnei pakhat siempêk a ti cheu,’ titu kha a nih, chu Mosie chu."
"This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us:",Ama chu thlalêra pungkhâwm- hai laia Sinai tlânga betu vântirko kuoma le ei thlatuhai kuoma um kha a nih; ama chu a mi pêk sâwng dinga thu hringhai latu kha a nih.
"to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,","Ei thlatuhai chun a thu an zâwm nuom nawh a, an sêl a, an lungrilhai chu Aigupta ram tieng a lêt nâwk tah a."
"saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.","Aron kuomah, ‘Kan hmaṭhuoitu dingin pathienhai mi siempêk rawh, Mosie Aiguptaa mi ṭhuoi suoktu hlak hi a chanchin kan hriet ta si nawh a,’ an ta."
"And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.","Chun, chuonghai chun se- bâwngte lim an siem a, a lim chu ran thatin an biek a, anni kutsuok chunga chun an hlim tah a."
"But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?","Chuongchun, Pathienin a nghat san a, vâna arasihai chibai an bûk theina dingin anni a ensan tah a; Zâwlnei Lekhabua, ‘Israel chihai, thlalêra khan kum sâwmli sûngin, Sa that le ran thatin kei in mi biek am a nih?"
"And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of the god Rephan, The figures which ye made to worship them: And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.","Molok puon in le pathien Rephan arasi khawm chu, Chibai bûk dingin a lim in siemhai kha, In zâwm lem hlak a; Chuleiin, Babulon khaw khêl tieng Ṭhuoi hmang ka ti cheu,’ ti ziek ang khan."
"Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.","“A lim a hmu anga siem dinga Mosie hriltuin a ruot ang khan, ei thlatuhaiin thlalêra khan inhriet- tirna puon in chu an nei a."
"Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;","Chu bawk chu ei thlatuhai thla nâwk khawmin an nei sâwng pei a, Pathienin ei thlatuhai hmaa Jentail a hnawt suokhai ram an hluo lai khan Josua lût ruolin an lûtpui a; David hung um chen khan chutaka chun a um ta zing a."
"who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.","Chu David chu Pathien mithmuin ditsak tlâkin a um a, Jakob Pathien ta dinga umna ding siempêk a hnih a."
But Solomon built him a house.,"Nisienlakhawm, Solomonin in chu a bâwlpêk ta lem a."
"Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in houses made with hands; as saith the prophet,","Nisienlakhawm, Achunghnung- tak chu kuta bâwl inhaiah a um ngai nawh; zâwlnei chun:-"
"The heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool of my feet: What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord: Or what is the place of my rest?","Lalpain, ‘Vân ka ṭhungpha a na, Hnuoi ka kepha innghatna a nih; In ieng angin am mi bâwlpêk in ta? Ka châwlna hmun khawm ieng am a na?"
Did not my hand make all these things?,"Keia kutin hieng thil iengkim hi ka siem naw am a nih? a tih, ti ziek ang khan."
"Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.","“Mi kâwmawhai, lungril le na tan nawhai, kumkhuoin Thlarau Inthieng hi in kal rawp el; in thlatuhai thaw ang pei khan in thaw hlak."
Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers;,"In thlatuhaiin zâwlnei lai an suknawmnat naw tu am an um a? Mi feltak hung ding thu hril lâwktuhai kha an sukhlum a; chun, Mi Takzet chu inmantirtu le thattuhai nangni tuhin in nih in sawnnaw."
"ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.","Vântirkohai ipêk sâwng Dân kha hmu zeta zâwm si lohai,” a ta."
"Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.","Chun, chuong thu chu an hrietin an lungril a khei tah a, Stephan chunga chun an ha an rawt a."
"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu Thla- rau Inthienga sip a na, vân tieng a en tlat a, Pathien ropuizie le Pathien changtienga Isu ngir a hmuh a,"
"and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.","“Ngai ta u, vân inhawnghai ka hmuh a, Pathien changtienga Mi- hriem Naupa ngîr khawm ka hmuh,” a ta."
"But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;","Chun, anni chu rawl inring- takin an khêk a, an na an hip a, inthuruolin an thawh a."
"and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.","Khuoa inthawk chu an hnawt- suok a, lungin an dêng a. A hretuhai chun tlangvâl pakhat a hming Saula ke bula chun an puonhai an sie tâwl a."
"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.","Chuongchun, Stephanin, “Lal Isu, ka thlarau la rawh,” tia Lalpa a ko laiin lungin an dêng mur mur a."
"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.","Chun, a dingṭhaṭhuon a, rawl inringtakin a khêk a, “Lalpa, hi an thil suksuol hi an chungah maw inphurtir naw rawh,” a ta. Chu thu chu a hril zo phingleh a ininnghil tah a. Saula khawm chun a thi chu a remtih a."
"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles.","Chu ni chun, kohran Jerusalema umhai chu miin nasatakin an suknawmna phut tah a; chuongchun, tirkohai bak naw chu Judai le Samari ram khaw tinah an indar ta vawng a."
"And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.","Chun, Pathien ngaisak tuhaiin amanih Stephan chu an phûm a, nasatakin an ṭap a."
"But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.","Saula ruok chun kohranhai chu a suknawmna bêk bêk a, in tinah a lût a, a nuhmei a pasalin a hnûk dawk a, intângna inah a khum hlak."
They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.,"Chun, ân darhai chu khaw tinah an feh a, thu chu an hril pei a."
"And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.","Chun, Philip chu Samari khuoah a zu feh a, an kuomah Krista thu a khêk pui a."
"And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.","Mipuihaiin a thu an hriet a, a thilmak thawhai an hmu chun Philip thu hril chu lungril hmunkhatin an ngaisak a,"
"For from many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.","khawhri inthiengnawhai chu mi tamtak an imanhai sûnga inthawkin rawl inringtaka khêka an suok leiin le, zeng le keinbai tamtak khawm an hung dam ta leiin."
And there was much joy in that city.,"Chun, chu khuoa chun nasatakin an lâwm tah a."
"But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:","Chun, a hming Simon, mi pakhat a um a; ama chun, chu khuoa chun dawi hmangin Samari khuoa mihai maktitakin a lo siem ta hlak a."
"to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.","Mi po po chun mi setaka inthawka ân laltak chenin, “Hi mipa hi Pathien thilthawtheina, ‘Ropui,’ an ti kha a ni hi,” tiin a thu an ngaisak tâwl hlak."
"And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.",A dâwi hmangin sâwttak mak titaka a siem hlak leiin a thu an ngaisak a nih.
"But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun Pathien ram chanchin ṭha le Isu Krista hming Chanchin Ṭha Philip hril chu an âwi phingleh, a nuhmei a pasalin baptisma an chang tah a."
"And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.","Chun, Simon rau khawmin a âwi ve tah a, chun baptisma a chang zo chun, Philip kuomah a um zing a. Inchikna le thilmak nasatak thawa umhai chu a hmu veh a, mak a ti hle hlak a."
"Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:","Chun, tirko Jerusalema umhai khan Samari khuoa mihaiin Pathien thu an awi ti an hrietin, an kuomah Peter le Johan chu an tir a."
"who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:",Anni chu an zuk tlung chun Thlarau Inthieng an hmu theina dingin an ṭawngṭaipêk a.
for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.,Chu hma chun anni laia tu chunga khawm a la tlung nawh; Lal Isu hmingin baptisma an chang chau a la nih.
"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.","Chun, an chungah an kut an innghat a, Thlarau Inthieng an hmu tah a."
"Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,","Chun, tirkohai kut innghat leia Thlarau Inthieng pêk a nih ti Simonin a hmuh a,"
"saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.","“Hi thuneina hi mi pe ve ro, tû chunga khawm kut kân nghatna taphawtin Thlarau Inthieng an hmu vena dingin,” tiin an kuomah tangka pêk a tum a."
"But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin a kuomah, “I tangka hi nanga ruolin bohmang raw se, Pathien thilpêk tangka suma inchâwk i tum leiin."
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.,"Hieng thua hin i ṭhang ve nawh, chan khawm i nei bawk nawh; i lungril Pathien ngaiin a fel nawh."
"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.","Chuleiin, i suol hi sim la, Lalpa kuomah ṭawngṭai rawh, chuongchun, i lungrila i ngaituo hi a ngaidam che rawi mawh."
For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.,"Thil khâkna mîta le, suol khuop thlûkna hmunah i um ti ka hriet a nih,” a ta."
"And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.","Chun, Simonin, “In thil hril hi ka chunga iengkhawm a tlung nawna dingin nangnîn Lalpa kuomah mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro,” a ta, a dawn a."
"They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.","Chuongchun, anni chun Lalpa thu chu an inhriettira an hril zoin, Jerusalemah an fe nâwk tah a; Samari rama mihai khaw tamtak kuomah Chanchin Ṭha chu an hril pei a."
"But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.","Chun, Lalpa vântirko pakhatin Philip chu a biek a, “Tho la, sim tienga Jerusalema inthawka Gaza zuk sun lampuia khan fe rawh, chu lampui chu thlalêra fe thleng a nih,” a ta."
"And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;","Chuongchun, a tho a, a fe tah a. Chun, ngai ta, Ethiopia rama mi pakhat, Ethiopia lalnu Kandaki hnuoia mitillâk inlaltak, a ro po po enkawltu, Jerusalemah Pathien be dingin a hang feh a."
"and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.",A hung tieng chun a tawlailîra ṭhung pumin zâwlnei Isai lekhabu a tiem pei a.
"And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.","Chun, Thlarau chun Philip kuomah, “Saw tawlailîr saw va hnai la, va pâwl rawh,” a ta."
"And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?","Chun, Philip chu mitillâk kuoma chun a va tlân a, zâwlnei Isai lekhabu a tiem a hriet a, “I tiem kha a umzie i hriet am?” a ta."
"And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.","Ama chun, “Tukhawmin an mi hrilfie naw chun, iengtin am hre thei ka ta?” a ta. Chun, a kuoma hung ṭhung dingin Philip chu a fiel tah a."
"Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:","Pathien Lekha a tiem lai chu hi hi a nih:- “That dingin berâm angin ama chu an ṭhuoi a; Berâmtê a hmul vâwtu hmaa a to zing angin, Ama khawmin a bau a ka nawh;"
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.,"A tlâwm laiin a rorêlna chu lâkpêkin a um a; A thlahai chanchin tuin am hril tâng an ta? Khawvêla inthawkin a hringna an lâkpêk ta sih a,” ti hi."
"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?","Chun, mitillâk chun Philip a biek a, a kuomah, “Zâwlneiin hieng thu hi tû thu am a na a hril, ama thu am a ni, mi dang thu? kân dawn che,” a ta."
"And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.","Philip chun a hril a, chu Pathien Lekha Thu chu a bulah a phut a, a kuomah Isu thu a hril a."
"And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?","Chun, lampuia an fe malamin tui ieng amanih an tlung a; chun, mitillâk chun, “En ta, hitaka hi tui a um, baptisma changna ding iengin am a mi hluo kher leh?” a ta."
,"[Chun, Philip chun, “I lungril po poa i ring chun, i chang thei,” a ta. Ama chun, “Isu Krista chu Pathien Naupa a ni ka ring,” a ta, a dawn a]."
"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.","Chun, tawlailîr chu ân ngîrtir a, an pahni chun, Philip le mitillâk chu tuia chun an zu feh a; chun, Philip chun ama chu a baptis tah a."
"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.","Tuia inthawk chu an hang suok phingleh, Lalpa Thlarau chun Philip chu a lâk hmang tah a; mitillâk chun ama chu a hmu nâwk ta nawh a, nisienlakhawm, hlimtakin a fe ta pei a."
"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.","Philip chu miin Azota khuoah an hmu nâwk tah a; chun, a fe thleng a, Kaisari khuo a tlung hmakhat chun, khaw tinah Chanchin Ṭha chu a hril pei a."
"But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,","Saula ruok chun, Lalpa in- chûktirhai a vau thu le that a tum thu chu a la sâksuok ta rawp a."
"and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.","Thiempu Laltak kuomah a fe a, Damaskaa inkhâwmna in po poa mihai kuoma pêk dingin lekha a hnih a, chu Lama mi chu tukhawm a hmu chun, nuhmei khawm, pasal khawm, Jerusalema khuop puma hung ṭhuoi theina dingin."
"And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven:","Chun, a fe laiin, Damaska a tlung tâwmin, kârloin var vâna inthawkin a vêlah a hung var phut a."
"and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?","Chun, hnuoiah a tluh a, a kuomah, “Saula, Saula, nangin iengdinga i mi suknawmna am a na?” tiin rawl a hriet a."
"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:","Chun, ama chun, “Tû am i na, Lalpa?” a ta."
"but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.","Lalpa chun, “Isu i suknawmnat hi ka nih; nisienlakhawm, tho la, khuoah lût rawh, chuongchun, i thaw ding lo hril an ti che,” a ta."
"And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man.","Chun, ama le fehai chu hril ding hre loin an ngir a, rawl chu an hriet a chu tukhawm an hmu si nawh."
"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.","Chun, Saula chu hnuoia inthawk chun a tho a; chun, a hang meng a, iengkhawm a hmu thei ta nawh a; chuongchun, a kutah an kei a, Damaskaa chun an ṭhuoi lût a."
"And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.","Ni thum khaw hmu loin a um a, iengkhawm a fâkin a dâwn nawh a."
"Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.","Chun, Damaskaa chun inchûk- tir pakhat a hming Anania a um a. Lalpa chun a mang angin a kuomah, “Anania,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Lalpa, en ta, hitaka hin ka um,” a ta."
"And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth;","Lalpa chun a kuomah, “Tho la, kawtthlêr, ‘Tlûn’ an tia chun fe la, Juda inah, Tarsa khuoa mi, a hming Saula indawn suok rawh; ngai ta, a ṭawngṭai zing a nih,"
"and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.","a hming Anania mi pakhat lûta, a mit sukvar dingin a chunga kut innghatin a hmu tah,” a ta."
"But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem:","Chun, Anania chun, “Lalpa, chu mipa chu Jerusalema i mi inthieng- hai chunga a suksuol tamzie thu mi tamtak baua inthawkin ka hriet a nih."
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.,"Hitaka khawm i hming lam taphawt chu khuop dingin thiempu lalhaia inthawkin thu a hmu zing annâwm,” a ta, a dawn a."
"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel:","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpa chun a kuomah, “Fe el rawh, Jentailhai, lalhai, Israel thlahai kuoma ka hming put lûtna dinga ka bêl ruot a nih."
for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.,"Ka hming leiin rinum ieng anga nasa am a tuor ding a kuomah lân hriettir ka tih,” a ta."
"And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Anania chu a va feh a, ina chun a lût a; a chungah kut ân nghat a, “Unau Saula, i mit varna ding le Thlarau Inthieng sipa i um theina dingin, Lalpa, i hungna lampuia i kuoma inlâr Isu khan a mi hung tir a nih,” a ta."
"And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;","Chun, kârloin a mita inthawk chun phuhlip ang ieng amanih a tla nghâl tah a, a mit a var nâwk tah a; chun, a tho a, baptisma a chang tah a."
and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.,"Chun, bu a fâk a, a har nâwk tah a. Chun, Damaskaa inchûktir umhai kuoma chun ni iengzat amanih a um a."
"And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.",Inkhâwmna inhaia chun Isu chu Pathien Naupa a nizie thu a khêkpui nghâl tah a.
"And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.","Chun, a thu hretuhai po po chun mak an ti hleh a; “Hi mipa hi Jerusalema hi hming lamtuhai suknawmna hlaktu kha a ni naw am a nih? Chuong mihai chu thiempu lalhai kuoma khuop puma ṭhuoi, a hung san a ni kha,” an ta."
"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.","Saula ruok chu a hung hrât nâwk zuol a, ama chu Krista a ni takzet ti a hrilfieh a, Damaskaa Juda umhai chu a sêldawng rawp hlak a."
"And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:","Chun, ni sâwt tak hnunga chun Saula sukhlum dingin Judahai chu an inrawn a;"
but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him:,"nisienlakhawm, ama chun an thurawt chu a lo hriet tah a. Sukhlum dingin kul kawtkhâr tina chun a sûn a zânin an inchân hlak a."
"but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.","Nisienlakhawm, a închûktir- haiin ama chu an ṭhuoi a, zânah kul tukverah bâwmin an thlâk thla tah a."
"And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.","Chun, Saula chun Jerusalem a tlung phingleh inchûktirhai chu pâwl a tum a; anni ruok chun an rêngin ama chu an ṭih a, inchûktir a ni ve ti an ring nawh a."
"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.","Barnaba ruok chun ama chu a ṭhuoi a, tirkohai kuoma chun a hungpui a, lampuia Lalpa a hmua a biekzie dâm, Damaskaa Isu hminga huoitaka a thu a hrilzie dâm khawm chu an kuomah a hril tah a."
"And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem,","Chuongchun, Saula chu Jeru- salema chun an kuoma lût hlak suok hlakin a um tah a, Lalpa hmingin huoitakin thu a hril hlak a."
preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.,"Chun, Grik ṭawng hmang Judahai lai thu a hril a, a sêl a; anni ruok chun ama chu sukhlum an tum a."
"And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.","Chun, unauhai chun chu chu an hrietin, Kaisari khuoah an ṭhuoi thlâk a, Tarsa khuoah an tir ta dai a."
"So the church throughout all Judæa and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.","Chuongchun, kohranhai chu Judai ram vêla dâm, Galili ram vêla dâm, Samari ram vêla dâm chun an det deu deu a, muongtakin an um tah a; chun, Lalpa ṭi dêkin, Thlarau Inthieng ithlamuongin an um a, an hung pung ta deu deu a."
"And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.","Chun, Peterin khawvêl a fang malamin, Ludda khuoa mi inthieng umhai kuomah a zu fe bawk a."
"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.","Chutaka chun mi pakhat, a hming Ainia a zeng leia kum riet khuma zâl zing a hmuh a."
"And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And straightway he arose.","Chun, Peter chun a kuomah, “Ainia, Isu Krista chun a sukdam che; tho la i puonpha ziel rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho nghâl tah a."
"And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.","Chun, Ludda khuo le Saron phaia um po pohai chun Ainia chu an hmuh a, Lalpa tieng an ngha tâwl tah a."
"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.","Chun, Joppa khuoah a hming Tabitha, inchûktir pakhat a um a, (Tabitha umzie chu Dorka a nih); chu nuhmei chun thil thawṭhat le thilpêk a hau hleh a."
"And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.","Chun, chuong lai chun a damnawh a, a thi tah a; chun an insil fai a, pindan chunghnungah an inzâl a."
"And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us.","Chun, Ludda khuo chu Joppa khaw kâwl a ni leiin, inchûktirhai chun Peter chutaka chun a um ti an hriet a, “Sâwt riel loin kan kuomah hung rawh,” tia ngên dingin a kuomah mi pahni an tir a."
"And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.","Chun, Peter chu a tho a, anni leh a fe ve tah a. Chun, a tlung phingleh pindan chunghnunga chun an ṭhuoi a; hmeithai po po chu a kâwla ngîrin, Dorka an kuoma a um laia a zakuo siemhai, a puon siemhai inentir pumin an ṭap tâwl a."
"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chun an rêngin ân suoktir vawng a, a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a ṭawngṭai tah a; chun, ruong tieng chu a nghah a, “Tabitha, tho rawh,” a ta. Chuong- chun, a mit a hung meng a, Peter chu a hmu phingleh a ṭhung tah a."
"And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.","Chun, Peter chun a kut a pêk a, a keitho tah a; chun, mi inthienghai le hmeithaihai chu a ko a, damin a khîkhmuh a."
And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.,"Chun, chu chu Joppa khuo po po chun an hriet ta vawng a; mi tamtakin Lalpa chu an ring tah a."
"And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.","Chun, Peter chu ni tamtak Joppa khuoa Simon, savun siemtu inah a châm zing a."
