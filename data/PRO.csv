"The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:","Israel lal, David naupa Solomon thuvarhai chu:"
To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;,Varna le inchûktirna hre dingin; Hrietthiemna thuhai hre dingin
"To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;","Thilthaw vara inchûktirna dawng dingin, Felnaa le rorêlnaa le thlierbîk nei lonaa leh;"
"To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:","Mi mâwl kuoma varna pe ding le, Tlangvâl kuoma hrietna le ngairuotthiemna pe dingin,"
"That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:","Mi var chun a hriet a, thiemnaa chun a belsa theina ding le, Hrietthiemna nei mi chun rorêlna ṭhahai chu a changna dingin;"
"To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.","Thuvar le tekhithu hrethiem ding le, Mi var thuhai le an thuril hrilhai chu hrethiem dingin."
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.,"LALPA ṭina chu hrietna bul a nih: Amiruokchu, invêt chun varna le inchûktirna chu an hmu- sit a."
"My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:","Ka naupa, i pa inchûktirna hi ngai la, I nu inchûktirna chu nghatsan naw rawh;"
"For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.","I lua chun pâr ṭhi mawitak nîng an ta, I rîng vêla chun ṭhi ang an ni ding a ni sih a."
"My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.","Ka naupa, mi suolhaiin an thlêm che chun Remtipui el naw rawh."
"If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;","Hienghin ti sien khawm, “Keini leh hung la, Thisen inchân ei ta, A san um loin mi pawitâwk- lo chu inrûkin inchân ei ta;"
"Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;","Seol ang elin an hring pumin lem ei ta; Mi felhai ngei chu, vânsama fethlahai ang elin;"
We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;,"Thil hluhai po po chu hmûng ei ta, Ei inhai chu râllâk thilin suksip ei ta;"
Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:,"I chanpuol chu keini lai sielût ve la, Ei rêngin sumbâwm khat ei nei ding annâwm” tiin."
"My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:","Ka naupa, anni chu lampuia chun intlawnpui naw la, An lampuia inthawk chun i ke chu vêng ṭha rawh."
"For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.","An kehai chu rîtlona tieng a tlân a, Thisen insuo dingin an inhmaw sih a."
For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:,Vate hrim hrim mithmua lên keiphar chu; A thlâwn el a ni sih a.
And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.,"Chun, chuong anni thisen ngei inchântuhai chun, Anni hringna ngei chu inrûkin an inchân a nih."
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.,Hlêpnaa duâm mi taphawthai lampui chu chuong ang chu a nih; A neituhai hringna chu a lâk hmang hlak.
Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;,Varna chu kawtthlêra chun inringtakin a khêk a; Khawlaiahai chun a râwl chu ân suoh a.
"She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:","Kawtthlêr inrîk mur murna hmun takhaia chun a khêk a, Dâi kawtkhâr lûtnaa dâm chun. Khawpui sûnga chun a thuhai chu a hril a."
"How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?","Ieng chen am nangni mi mâwlhai, mâwlna hi in hmangai ding a na? Hmusittuhai chu an hmusitnaa chun an lâwmin, Invêthai chun ieng chen am hrietna chu in theida ding a na?"
"Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.","Ka kâwknaa hin nghakîr unla, Ngai ta u, in kuoma chun ka thlarau chu hung buok ka ta, Ka thuhai chu in kuomah inhriettir ka ti cheu."
"Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;","Ka ko cheu a, in ngaisak nawh a, Ka bân ka pharsuok a, tu- khawma in ngaisak nawh a,"
"But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:","Ka thurâwn chu iengkhawm loah in siem a, Ka kâwkna a ieng khawm chu in ngai naw leiin,"
I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;,"Kei khawm in lunginzing nia chun innui ka ta, In ṭitna hung pha khawm chun nuisan ka tih,"
"When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.","In ṭitna chu thlipui angin, In lunginzîngna chu thlivir angin a hung a, Rimsikna le tuorna chu in chungah a tlung pha chun;"
"Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:","Chun, kei chu mi hung ko an ta, nisienlakhawm, dawn naw ningah; Nguntakin mi hung zawng an ta, nisienlakhawm, mi hmu naw hi hai."
"For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,","Hrietna chu an theidah a, LALPA ṭîna chu an thlang nawh a,"
"They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof.","Ka thurâwn a ieng ieng khawm an zâwm nawh a, Ka kâwkna po po chu an hmusit a,"
"Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.","Chuleiin, anni lampui rasuok ngei chu fâng an ta, An thiltumhai ngeia suksip ni tâng an tih."
"For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.","Mi mâwl hnungtawlna chun anni chu sukhlum a ta, Invêthai nuomsakbâwlna chun anni chu a suksiet ding a ni sih a."
"But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.","Amiruokchu, tukhawm keia thu ngai chu himtakin chêng a ta, Rîtlona ṭi dêr loin um ṭawk ṭawk a tih."
The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.,"Solomon Thuvarhai chu. Naupa var chun pa lâwm a siem a, Naupa invêt ruok chu nu ta dingin phurrik a nih."
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivereth from death.,"Khawhlona rohai chu ienga khawm a hlâwk nawh a, Felna ruok chun thinaa inthawkin a san suok."
Jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked.,"Mi fel hringna chu a ṭâm LALPA chun phal naw nih a, Mi khawhlo thilchâk chu a hnawt hmang."
He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.,"Kut zawia sinthaw chu a hung pase a, Kut taima ruok chun ama chu a sukhausa."
He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.,"Nipui laia la khâwmtu chu naupa var a na, Busîk huna ininnghil ruok chu naupa, inzakna intluntu chu a nih."
Blessings are upon the head of the righteous; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.,"Mi fel lu chunga chun malsâwmnahai a um a, Mi khawhlo bau ruok chu nunsietnain ân khum."
The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot.,"Mi indik hriet zingna chu malsâwmin a um a, Mi khawhlo hming ruok chu thâm hmang a tih."
The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool shall fall.,"Lungrila var chun thupêkhai pawm a ta, Hmûr khêlinhlip ruok chu sukhnuoi nîng a tih."
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be known.,"Mi tluongtaka fe chu ngamtakin a feh a, A lampuihai pêtsantu ruok chu hriet nîng a tih."
He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; But a prating fool shall fall.,"Mi a mit sêp sêp vêltu chun lungngaina ân tlungtir a, Hmûr khêlinhlip ruok chu sukhnuoi nîng a tih."
The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.,"Mi fel bau chu hringna tuikhur a na, Mi khawhlo bau ruok chu nunsietnain ân khum."
Hatred stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions.,"Theidana chun inkhingna a chawk suok a, Hmangaina ruok chun bawsietna po po ân khum hmang."
In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.,"Hrietthiemna neitu hmûrhaia chun varna hmu a na, Hmawl ruok chu mi hrietthiemna boa um ruongzâng ta ding a nih."
Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction.,"Mi var chun hrietna a siekhâwl a, Mi invêt bau ruok chu sietna zing a nih."
The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty.,"Mi hausa hausakna chu a khawpui det a na, Mi pasie suksietna ruok chu an pasietna a nih."
"The labor of the righteous tendeth to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin.","Mi fel sininrimna chun hringna ân tlun a, Mi khawhlo hlâwkna chun suolna."
He is in the way of life that heedeth correction; But he that forsaketh reproof erreth.,"Sukdikna pawisatu chu hring- na lampuiah a um a nih, Kâwkna nghatsantu ruok chun a suksuol hlak."
He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; And he that uttereth a slander is a fool.,Hmûr khêlinhlipa theidana chu ip a; Demna thu sâksuoktu chu invêt a nih.
In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely.,Thu um khâwm ṭeu laia hin bawsietna a bo nawh a; A hmûr vêngṭhatu ruok chun vartakin a thaw a nih.
The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: The heart of the wicked is little worth.,"Mi fel lei chu tangka ditum ang a na, Mi khawhlo lungril chu man tlâwmte a nih."
The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding.,"Mi fel hmûrhai chun mi tamtak a châwm a, Invêt ruok chu hrietthiemna tlasamin a thi."
"The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; And he addeth no sorrow therewith.","LALPA malsâwmna chun a siem hausa a, Chutaka chun lungngaina a belsa nawh."
It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And so is wisdom to a man of understanding.,"Khawhlona thaw hi invêt ta ding chun ruolsiekna ang a na, Chuong ang bawk chun, hrietthiemna nei mi ta dingin varna chu a nih."
"The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; And the desire of the righteous shall be granted.","Mi khawhlo ṭitna chu ama chung ngeiah hung tlung a ta, Mi fel ditna chu inhlawtlingtir nîng a tih."
"When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.","Thlivir chu a fe hmang el hlak angin, mi khawhlo chu a um ta nawh a, Nisienlakhawm, mi fel chu kumkhaw lungphûm ang a nih."
"As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him.","Uoin thûrin ha a sukṭim ang le, meikhuin mithai a sukthîp angin, Chuong ang chu a nih mi thabo chu a tirtuhai ta dingin."
The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.,"LALPA ṭina chun nihai chu a suksei a, Mi khawhlo kumhai ruok chu suktâwi nîng a tih."
The hope of the righteous shall be gladness; But the expectation of the wicked shall perish.,"Mi fel beiseina chu lâwmna nîng a ta, Mi khawhlo beiseina ruok chu bohmang a tih."
The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.,"LALPA lampui chu mi tluong ta ding chun kul nghettak a na, Suolna thawtuhai ta ding ruok chun bohmangna a nih."
The righteous shall never be removed; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land.,"Mi fel chu sawn hmang ni ngai naw nih a, Mi khawhlo ruok chu hnuoia hin chêng naw nih."
The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off.,"Mi fel bau chun varna a phusuok a, Lei khêlinhlip ruok chu ât bawng nîng a tih."
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked speaketh perverseness.,"Mi fel hmûrhai chun lâwm tlâkhai chu a hriet a, Mi khawhlo bau ruok chun khêlthu a sâk suok hlak."
A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight.,Bûkna indik naw chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum a nih; Inkhîna indik ruok chu a lâwm zâwng a nih.
"When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.","Chapona chu a hung pha chun, inzaknain a hung zui; Varna ruok chu inngaitlâwmhai kuomah a um."
The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.,"Mi tluong chu a lungril indiktak chun ṭhuoi a ta, Bawsetuhai ruok chu an khêl- inhlipnain anni suksieng a tih."
Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death.,"Lungsen nia chun hausakna chu a ṭhahnem chuong nawh a, Felna ruok chun thinaa inthawkin a sansuok."
The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.,"Mi fel famkim chu a felna chun a lampui kâwkhmûng a ta, Mi khawhlo ruok chu a khawhlonaa ngei chun tlu lem a tih."
The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity.,"Mi tluong chu an felna chun anni sansuok a ta, Ringmawumtaka thawtuhai ruok chu an thil sukpawi ngei chun anni lâng a tih."
"When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth.","Mi khawhlo chu a thi chun, a beiseina chu bohmang a tih, Mi fel naw beiseina chu bohmang bawk a tih."
The righteous is delivered out of trouble; And the wicked cometh in his stead.,"Mi fel chu buoinaa inthawk san suokin a um a, A hmuna chun mi khawhlo chu a lût hlak."
With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.,"Pathien ngaisak naw mi chun a bauin a tuolbâwm chu a suksiet a, Mi fel ruok chu hrietna leia sanhim a nih."
"When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.","Mi fel le ṭhataka a khawsak sûng po, khawpui chu a hlim hlak, Chun, mi khawhlo chu a bohmang pha chun khêkri a um hlak."
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.,"Mi tluong malsâwmna leiin khawpui chu chawimawiin a um a, Nisienlakhawm, mi khawhlo baua pei thlâkin a um hlak."
He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace.,"A tuolbâwm ngainêptu chu varna bo a nih, Mi hrietthiemna nei mi ruok chu a to ṭawk ṭawk."
He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.,"Mi lâwt vêltu anga invâk vêl chun thurûk a phawr hlak a, Mi lungril ringumtak ruok chun thu chu a ip hlak."
"Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.","Inṭhuoina var um nawnaa chun mi an tlu hlak a, Thurâwntu tamtakhai lai ruok chun himna a um."
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure.,"Hmêlmak mi ta dinga aiawtu ni chu kawisieng a ta, Aiawtu nina theidatu ruok chu nghet lem a tih."
A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches.,"Nuhmei zângaithei chun inzâumna a kawl zing a, Pasal kâwlhrâwng chun hausaknahai a kawl hlak."
The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.,"Mi zainêmtak chun a lungril ta ding ngeiin thil ṭha a thawh a, Mi rilo ruok chun ama tisa ngei a sukbuoi."
The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.,"Mi khawhlo chun hlaw hmusit- umtakhai chu a hlawh a, Felna tutu ruok chun lâwmman indiktak chu a hmuh."
He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain unto life; And he that pursueth evil doeth it to his own death.,"Felnaa ngîr det tlattu chun hringna chu hmûng a ta, Suolna hnawttu chun a thina ding ngeiin a thaw a nih."
They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah; But such as are perfect in their way are his delight.,"Lungrila khêlinhliphai chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum an na, An lampuia fel famkimhai ruok chu a lâwm zâwng an nih."
"Though hand join in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.","Mi rilo chu hrem naw ni naw ni, Mi fel thla ruok chu sanhim nîng a tih."
"As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout, So is a fair woman that is without discretion.","Nuhmei hmêlṭha ngairuotthiemna neilo chu, Vawkpui hnâra rângkachak kutsebi ang a nih."
The desire of the righteous is only good; But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.,"Mi fel dit zâwng chu thil ṭha chau a nih, Mi rilo beiseina chu lungsenna chau a nih."
"There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want.","Semdar raka pung deu deu si a um a, Mamaw tâwk bâk inro tlata tlasam si a um bawk a."
The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.,"Mi tiktlai chu sukthâu nîng a ta, Tui buoktu chu, ama ngei khawm tui buokkhum nîng a tih."
"He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.","Bu inrotu chu miin ṭawngsie inphur an tih, A zawrtu lu chunga ruok chun malsâwmna um lem a tih."
"He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him.","Thil ṭha nguntaka zawngtu chun ditsakna a zawng a nih, Pawitâwkna zawngtu chunga ruok chun pawitâwkna chu tlung a tih."
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.,"A hausaknahai ring mi chu tlûng a ta, Mi fel ruok chu hna hring angin inno a tih."
He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.,"Mi ama in ngei sukbuoitu chun takbo ro hluong a ta, Mi invêt chu lungril var kuoma siehlaw nîng a tih."
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls.,"Mi fel ra chu hringna thingkûng a na, Lungrilhai latu chu mi var a nih."
"Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; How much more the wicked and the sinner!","Ngai ta, mi fel chu hnuoia hin thung nîng a ta, Mi suol le mi khawhlohai khawm chu thung an va ni nasa awm de!"
Whoso loveth correction loveth knowledge; But he that hateth reproof is brutish.,"Inchûktirna ngainatu chun hrietna a ngaina a, Kâwkna theidatu ruok chu intlaw a nih."
A good man shall obtain favor of Jehovah; But a man of wicked devices will he condemn.,"Mi ṭha chun LALPA ditsakna hmûng a ta, Thiltum khawhlo nei mi ruok chu thiemnaw inchangtir a tih."
A man shall not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous shall not be moved.,"Mihriem chu khawhlonain indinsuok an ni ngai nawh a, Mi fel zung ruok chu sawnhmang a ni ngai nawh."
A worthy woman is the crown of her husband; But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.,"Nuhmei ringum chu a pasal ta dingin lallukhum a na, Thil inzapuium thawtu ruok chu a ruhai ta dingin inngêna ang a nih."
The thoughts of the righteous are just; But the counsels of the wicked are deceit.,"Mi fel ngaituohai chu thil indik a na, Mi khawhlo thurâwn ruok chu inhlêmna a nih."
The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood; But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.,"Mi khawhlo thuhai chu thisen insuo dinga inchântu a na, Nisienlakhawm, mi fel bau chun anni a san suok hlak."
"The wicked are overthrown, and are not; But the house of the righteous shall stand.","Mi khawhlohai chu pei thlâkin an um a, an um ta nawh a, Nisienlakhawm, mi fel insûng ruok chu a ngîr zing hlak."
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom; But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.,"Mi chu a varna anghu peiin hrilmawi nîng a ta, Lungril khêlinhlip nei mi ruok chu ngainêp nîng a tih."
"Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant, Than he that honoreth himself, and lacketh bread.","Mi mâni le mâni insiechunga, fâk ding nei lo nêkin, Mi ngainatum raklo, siehlaw nei si kha a ṭha lem."
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.,"Mi fel chun a ran hai hringna chu a ngaisak a, Mi suol zângaina innêm ruok chu a rilo."
He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain persons is void of understanding.,"A hnuoi inlettu chun bei nei ṭeu a ta, Mi teplohai zuitu ruok chu hrietthiemna bo a nih."
The wicked desireth the net of evil men; But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.,"Misuol chun mi rilohai lên chu a ditpui a, Mi fel zung ruok chun ra ân suo."
In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man; But the righteous shall come out of trouble.,"Hmûrhai bawsietnaa chun mi rilo châng chu a um a, Mi fel ruok chu buoinaa in- thawk chun hung suok a tih."
A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth; And the doings of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.,"A baua ra thil ṭha chun mi chu suktlai nîng a ta, Ama kut thilthawhai ngei chu a kuomah pêk nîng a tih."
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel.,"Ama mithaia chun mi invêt lampui chu ân dik a, Mi var ruok chun thurâwn chu a ngai hlak."
A fool’s vexation is presently known; But a prudent man concealeth shame.,"Invêt lungsenna chu hriet uor a ni hlak a, Mi var ruok chun inzakna chu a thuphmang hlak."
"He that uttereth truth showeth forth righteousness; But a false witness, deceit.","Thutak sâksuok hlaktu chun felna chu ân entir a, Hrepuitu inkhêl ruok chun hlêmna ân entir hlak."
There is that speaketh rashly like the piercings of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health.,"Kâwlhnâm isun anga tlahawltaka thuhril a um a, Mi var lei ruok chu a hrisêl a nih."
The lip of truth shall be established for ever; But a lying tongue is but for a moment.,"Thutak hmûr chu kumkhuoa tungding nîng a ta, Lei khêlinhlip ruok chu mit- khapkâr chaua ding a nih."
Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil; But to the counsellors of peace is joy.,Rîtlona rawt suoktuhai lung- rila chun hlêmna a um a; Inremna rawt suoktuhai kuoma ruok chun hlimna a um.
There shall no mischief happen to the righteous; But the wicked shall be filled with evil.,"Mi fel kuoma chun thil pawi hrim tlung naw nih a, Mi suol ruok chu rîtlonaa suksip nîng a tih."
Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah; But they that deal truly are his delight.,"Hmûr khêlinhliphai chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum an na, Indiktaka thawtuhai ruok chu a lâwmna an ni hlak."
A prudent man concealeth knowledge; But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.,"Mi var chun hrietna chu a thup a, Invêthai lungril ruok chun invêtna a tlânginsampui."
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; But the slothful shall be put under taskwork.,"Mi taima kut chun rorêlna chu kawl a ta, Mi thabo ruok chu sin inthawluitirna hnuoia sie nîng a tih."
Heaviness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop; But a good word maketh it glad.,"Mihriem lungrila inlung- khamna chun a sukkûn a, Thu ṭha ruok chun a suklâwm hlak."
The righteous is a guide to his neighbor; But the way of the wicked causeth them to err.,"Mi fel chu a tuolbâwm ta dingin ṭhuoitu a na, Mi khawhlo lampui ruok chun ân suksuoltir hlak."
The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting; But the precious substance of men is to the diligent.,"Mi thabo chun a ramsuoknaa a lâk chu a raw nawh a, Amiruokchu, mihriema thil hlutak. chu taima kuomah a um;"
In the way of righteousness is life; And in the pathway thereof there is no death.,Felna lampuia chun hringna a um a; Chu lampuia chun thina a um nawh.
A wise son heareth his father’s instruction; But a scoffer heareth not rebuke.,"Naupa var chun a pa inchûktirna chu a ngai a, Hmusittu ruok chun kâwkna chu a ngai nawh."
A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth; But the soul of the treacherous shall eat violence.,"Miin a bau rasuoka inthawkin thil ṭha chu fâng a ta, Mi ringum naw lungril ruok chun hrângsietna fâng a tih."
He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life; But he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.,"A bau vêng ṭhatu chun a hringna a kawl ṭha a, A hmûrhai ka lientu ruok chun suksietna tuok a tih."
"The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.","Mi thabo lungril chun a châk hlaka chu, iengkhawm a nei nawh, Mi taima lungril ruok chu sukthâu nîng a tih."
"A righteous man hateth lying; But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.","Mi fel chun khêl hril a theida a, Mi khawhlo ruok chun inzakna a siemin kâwkna a lâk lût hlak."
Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner.,"Kawnglama mi tluong chu felnain ama a vêng a, Khawhlona ruok chun mi suol chu a buon thlûk."
"There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great wealth.","Ama le ama insukhausa a, iengkhawm nei silo a um a, Ama le ama insukpase a, hau- sakna nasatak nei a um bawk."
The ransom of a man’s life is his riches; But the poor heareth no threatening.,"Mihriem hringna intlanna chu a hausaknahai a nih, Mi pasie ruok chun inṭhina chu a ngai nawh."
The light of the righteous rejoiceth; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.,"Mi fel varna chu a hlim a, Mi khawhlo khâwnvar ruok chu herhlum nîng a tih."
By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom.,"Chaponaa chun inkhingna a suok a, Thurâwn ṭhataka ruok chun varna a um."
Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; But he that gathereth by labor shall have increase.,"Teplo mei meia hausakna hmu chu kiem a ta, Sininrima la khâwmtu chun a pung hmûng a tih."
"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.","Beisei hlawsamna chun lungril a sukdam nawh a, Châk zâwng hung tlung ruok chu hringna thing a nih."
Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.,"Tukhawm thu hmusittu chun ama chungah sietna ân tlun hlak a, Thupêk ṭitu ruok chu lâwmman pêkin um a tih."
"The law of the wise is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death.","Mi var inchûktirna chu hringna tuikhur a na, Thina chânghaia inthawka fe kiengna leh."
Good understanding giveth favor; But the way of the transgressor is hard.,"Hrietthiemna ṭha chun ditsakna a chang a, Mi ringum naw lampui ruok chu a kherinkhâwng."
Every prudent man worketh with knowledge; But a fool flaunteth his folly.,"Mi var tinhai chun hrietna leh sin an thawh a, Mi invêt ruok chun invêtna chu a thedar."
A wicked messenger falleth into evil; But a faithful ambassador is health.,"Thangko khawhlo chu thil suolah a tlu hlak a, Aiawtu ringum ruok chu a hrisêl a nih."
Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth correction; But he that regardeth reproof shall be honored.,"Tlâksamna le inzakna chu inchûktirna sêlkaltu kuoma chun um an ta, Kâwkna pawisatu ruok chu chawimawi nîng a tih."
The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.,"Nuom zâwng sukfamkim hi lungrila chun a thlum a, Amiruokchu, suolnaa inthawka fe kieng hi invêthai ta ding chun tirdakum a nih."
"Walk with wise men, and thou shalt be wise; But the companion of fools shall smart for it.","Mi varhai intlawnpui la, nang khawm var i tih, Mi invêthai inruolpui ruok chu suksiet nîng a tih."
Evil pursueth sinners; But the righteous shall be recompensed with good.,"Thil ṭha naw chun mi suolhai chu a hnawt pei a, Mi fel ruok chu thil ṭhaa thung nîng a tih."
A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children; And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous.,"Mi ṭha chun a tuhai ta ding chenin rohluo ding a mâkpêk hlak a, Mi suol hausakna chu mi fel ta dinga siekhâwl chau a nih."
Much food is in the tillage of the poor; But there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice.,"Mi pasie hnuoi inletnaa chun bu tamtak a um a, Amiruokchu, remruot fel naw leia suksiet chutaka chun a um."
He that spareth his rod hateth his son; But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.,"A hmawl hlatu chun a naupa a theida a, Ama hmangaitu ruok chun taimatakin a thunun hlak."
The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul; But the belly of the wicked shall want.,"Mi fel chun a lungrila a dittâwkin a fâk hlak a, Mi khawhlo phîng ruok chu tlasam a tih."
Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands.,"Nuhmei var taphawt chun a in chu a bâwl a, Nuhmei invêt ruok chun a kuthaiin a ṭhiek hlak."
He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Jehovah; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.,"Mi, felnaa fe chun LALPA chu a ṭih a, A lampuihaia khêlinhlip ruok chun ama a hmusit hlak."
In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for his pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.,"Mi invêt baua chun chapona hmawl a um a, Mi var hmûrhai ruok chun hla lem a tih."
"Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox.","Bâwngchalhai um nawnaa chun ran in chu a fai a, Amiruokchu, hlâwkna nasatak chu bâwngchal hrâtna lei a nih."
A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness uttereth lies.,"Thuhretu ringum chu inkhêl naw nih a, Thuhretu indik naw ruok chun khêl hril a tih."
"A scoffer seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding.","Hmusittu chun varna a zawng hlak a, a hmu ngai nawh, Hrietthiemna neitu ta ding ruok chun thiemna chu a awlsam hlak."
"Go into the presence of a foolish man, And thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.","Mi invêt hmaihmaa inthawk chun fe hmang rawh, Amaa inthawk chun thiemna hmûrhai hmu chuong naw ti nih."
The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit.,"Mi var varna chu a lampui hrietthiem chu a na, Mi invêt invêtna ruok chu khêlthu chu a nih."
A trespass-offering mocketh fools; But among the upright there is good will.,"Mi suol chun suolna chu an nuisan a, Mi tluonghai laia ruok chun Pathien ditsakna chu a um."
The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy.,"Lungril chun ama khâkna tak chu a hriet a, Hmêlmak mi chun an hlimna chu a sukbuoi ngai nawh."
The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish.,"Mi khawhlo in chu nam thlûk nîng a ta, Mi tluong puon in ruok chu um rân a tih."
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; But the end thereof are the ways of death.,"Mihriem kuoma indik âwmtak- a inlang lampui chu a um a, Chu tâwpna ruok chu thina lampuihai a nih."
Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness.,"Innuinaa ngei khawm lungril chu a lungngai a, Chu hlimna tâwpna chu chungrikna a nih."
The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And a good man shall be satisfied from himself.,"Lungrila hnungtawltu chu ama lampuihai ngeia suksip nîng a ta, Chun, mi ṭha chu amaa inthawk ngei chun suktlai nîng a tih."
The simple believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going.,"Mi mâwl chun thu tinrêng el hi a ring a, Mi var ruok chun a fena chu a en ngun hlak."
"A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident.","Mi var chun suol chu a ṭih a, a fe hmangsan hlak a, Mi invêt ruok chun chaponain a hmang a, ama ân ring tlat hlak."
He that is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated.,"Lunginsen awltak chun invêttakin thaw rawp a ta, Chun, mi remruotna khawhlo neitu chu theida ni bawk a tih."
The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.,"Mi mâwl chun invêtna ro chu a hluo a, Mi varhai ruok chu thiemna inkhumtirin an um."
"The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous.","Mi suol chu mi ṭha hmaa chun a kûn a, Mi khawhlo chu mi fel daikawtkhârhaia chun a kûn bawk a."
The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends.,"Mi pasie chu a tuolbâwmhai ngei khawma theida a ni hlak a, Mi hausa ruok chun ruolhai tamtak a nei."
"He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he.","A tuolbâwm hmusittu chun a suksuol a na, Mi pasie chunga lunginsietna nei ruok chu a hlim a nih."
Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.,Thil ṭha naw rawt suoktuhai chun an suksuol a ni naw am a nih? Thil ṭha rawt suoktuhai kuoma ruok chun thutak le lunginsietna um a tih.
In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.,"Sininrimna po poa hin hlâwkna a um a, Hmûrhaia a hrila hril ngawt el hi chu tlâksamnaah ân nghat."
The crown of the wise is their riches; But the folly of fools is only folly.,"An hausaknahai chu mi var ta ding chun an lallukhum a na, Invêthai invêtna ruok chu invêtna ringawt el a nih."
A true witness delivereth souls; But he that uttereth lies causeth deceit.,"Thuhretu indik chun mihai a sansuok hlak a, Thukhêl sâksuoktu ruok chun inhlêmna ân umtir."
In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge.,"LALPA ṭinaa hin ringna nghettak a um a, A thlahai chun inhumhimna hmun nei an tih."
"The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death.","LALPA ṭina chu hringna tuikhur a na, Thina chânghaia inthawka pêt hmangna leh."
In the multitude of people is the king’s glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.,"Mipuihai pungkhâwmnaa chun lal ropuina chu a um a, Mipui tlâksamnaa ruok chun lal nau sietna chu a um thung."
He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.,"Mi lunginsen intaktak chu hrietthiemna nasatak nei a nih, Lungril ṭuonrang ruok chun invêtna chu a chawimawi a nih."
A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones.,"Lungril hrisêl chu taksa hringna a na, Itthîkna ruok hi chu ruhai ta dinga hmawnna a nih."
He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him.,"Mi pasie nêksâwrtu chun ama Siemtu a hmusit a nih, Tlasam chunga lunginsietna nei ruok chun ama ân za a nih."
The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing; But the righteous hath a refuge in his death.,"Mi khawhlo chu a thilthaw ri- loa chun sukthlûkin a um a, Mi fel ruok chun a thinaa chun beiseina a nei hlak."
Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; But that which is in the inward part of fools is made known.,"Varna chu mi hrietthiemna neitu lungrila chun a chêng a, Invêthai lungrila um ruok chu ân hrietsa zing a nih."
Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people.,"Felna hin hnam a chawimawi a, Suolna ruok hi chu mi tukhawm ta dinga hmusitumna a nih."
The king’s favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath will be against him that causeth shame.,"Siehlaw vartaka thawtu chunga chun lal ditsakna chu a um a, Ama sukzaktu chunga ruok chun a lunginsenna um a tih."
A soft answer turneth away wrath; But a grievous word stirreth up anger.,"Dawnna innêm chun lungin- senna a hnawt hmang a, Ṭawng theidaum ruok chun lunginsenna a chawktho."
The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools poureth out folly.,"Mi var lei chun hrietna indik a hril suok hlak a, Mi invêt bau ruok chun invêtna a bun suok hlak."
"The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.","LALPA mithai chu hmun tinah a um a, Thil ṭha le thil ṭha naw chu a hmu zing hlak."
A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit.,"Lei hrisêl chu hringna thing a na, Chutaka khêlthu ruok chu lungril kawidarna a nih."
A fool despiseth his father’s correction; But he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence.,"Mi invêt chun a pa inchûktirna chu a hmusit a, Kâwkna ngaisaktu ruok chun varna a chang hlak."
In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.,"Mi fel ina chun ro tamtak a um a, Mi khawhlo hlâwknaa ruok chun buoina a um."
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish doeth not so.,"Mi var hmûrhai chun hrietna a the dar a, Invêt lungril ruok chun chuong angin a thaw ve nawh."
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But the prayer of the upright is his delight.,"Mi khawhlo inthawina chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum a na, Mi tluong ṭawngṭâina ruok chu a lâwm zâwng a nih."
The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.,"Mi khawhlo lampui chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum a na, Felna hnawttu ruok chu a hmangai hlak."
There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; And he that hateth reproof shall die.,"Lampui mâksantu ta ding chun sukdikna lungngaiumtak a um hlak, Kâwkna theidatu chu thi ngei a tih."
Sheol and Abaddon are before Jehovah; How much more then the hearts of the children of men!,"Seol le Abaddon hman LALPA hmaa chun an um a, Mihriem nauhai lungrilhai chu a va um nasa âwm deh e!"
A scoffer loveth not to be reproved; He will not go unto the wise.,"Hmusittu chun kâwka um chu a ngaina nawh a, Mi var kuoma khawm fe ngai bawk naw nih."
A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.,"Lungril hlim chun hmêl hlimtak a siem a, Lungril lungngai ruok chun lungvar a suksiet hlak."
The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.,"Mi hrietthiemna neitu lungril chun hrietna a zawng hlak a, Invêthai bau ruok chu invêtnain ân châwm."
All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he that is of a cheerful heart hath a continual feast.,"Sukrinuma umhai nihai po po chu ni rilo an na, Lungril lâwmtak mi ruok chun ruoiṭhe zing zingna a nei."
"Better is little, with the fear of Jehovah, Than great treasure and trouble therewith.","Hausakna nasatak, buoipuiumtak nêkin, LALPA ṭina le tlâwmte nei a ṭha lem."
"Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.",Bâwngchal châwm thau buthlêng chutaka intheidana umna nêkin. Thlaihna buthlêng chutaka hmangaina umna chu a ṭha lem.
A wrathful man stirreth up contention; But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.,"Mi nunsie chun inhalna a chawktho a, Mi lunginsen intak ruok chun inhalna a sukre."
The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway.,"Mi thabo lampui chu hling daihai ang a na, Mi tluong lampui ruok chu lamtluongpui a nih."
A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother.,"Naupa var chun pa lâwm a siem a, Mi invêt ruok chun a nu chu a hmusit."
Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding maketh straight his going.,"Mi lungril bo ta ding chun invêtna hi hlimum a na, Mi hrietthiemna nei mi ruok chun a fena chu a suktlûn hlak."
"Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counsellors they are established.","Inrâwnna um nawnaa chu thiltumhai chu a hlawsam hlak a, Amiruokchu, thurâwntuhai inkhâwm laia chun tungding an nih."
"A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good is it!","Dawnna indik chun mi a suklâwm a, A huntaka thu a ni tak hril chu a va ṭha de!"
"To the wise the way of life goeth upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath.","Mi var lampui chu hringnaah a tungin a kai, Hnuoi tienga Seol chu a mâksan theina dingin."
Jehovah will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow.,"Mi chapo sûngkuo chu LALPA chun kar thlûng a ta, Hmeithai ramri ruok chu tungdingpêk a tih."
Evil devices are an abomination to Jehovah; But pleasant words are pure.,"Remruotna rilohai hi LALPA ta dingin tirdakum a na, Thu lâwmumhai ruok chu ân thieng."
He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he that hateth bribes shall live.,"Hlêpnaa duâm mi chun a insûng a chawkbuoi a, Thamna theidatu ruok chu hring a tih."
The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.,"Mi fel lungril chun dawn dân ding ân chûk hlak a, Mi khawhlo bau ruok chun thil ṭhalohai a sâksuok hlak."
Jehovah is far from the wicked; But he heareth the prayer of the righteous.,"Mi khawhloa inthawkin LALPA chu a hla a, Mi fel ṭawngṭâina ruok chu a hriet hlak."
The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; And good tidings make the bones fat.,"Mithai varna chun lungril a suklâwm a, Chanchin ṭhahai chun ruhai a suktlawr."
The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life Shall abide among the wise.,"Hringna sukdikna ngaithlâkna neitu chu, Mi var lai chun chêng a tih."
He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.,"Inchûktirna sêlkaltu chun ama lungril ngei kha a hmusit a nih; Amiruokchu, kâwkna ngaitu chun hrietthiemna a nei hlak."
The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor goeth humility.,"LALPA ṭîna chu varna inchûktirna a nih; Chun, inzakaina hmaa chun inngaitlâwmna a fezie."
The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.,"Lungril siemrêlnahai chu mihriem ta a na, Leia dawnna ruok chu LALPA kuoma inthawk a nih."
All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits.,"Mihriem lampuihai po po chu ama mithmuahai chun ân thieng a, LALPA ruok chun lungrilhai chu ân khi hlak."
"Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established.","I sinthawhai chu LALPA kuomah inkawltir la, I ngaituohai chu sukdet nîng a tih."
"Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.","LALPA chun thil tinrêng hi san nei sengin a siem a, Anih, mi khawhlo ngei khawm chu ni ṭha nawa dingin."
"Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.","Lungrila chapo taphawt chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum a nih, Ama chu hrem naw ni naw nih."
By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil.,"Zângaina le thutak chun khawhlona chu sâwpfai a na, LALPA ṭina leiin mihaiin suolna an zâmsan."
"When a man’s ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.","Mi a um dânin LALPA a suklawm chun, A hmêlmahai ngei khawm ama le inrem dingin a siem."
"Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice.","Indiklona leia hlâwkna nasatakhai nêkin, Felna leia tlâwmte chu a ṭha lem."
A man’s heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps.,"Mihriem lungril chun a lampui chu a riruong hlak a, A kalchawihai ruok chu LALPA chun a kâwkhmu hlak."
A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment.,"Lal hmûrhaia chun vân tieng thusukthlûk chu a um a, Rorêlnaah a bau chun bawse ngai naw nih."
A just balance and scales are Jehovah’s; All the weights of the bag are his work.,"Inkhina le bûkna indikhai chu LALPA ta a na, Ip riknahai po po khawm chu ama sinthaw a nih."
It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness.,"Khawhlona thaw chu lalhai ta dingin tirdakum a nih, Lalṭhungpha chu felnaa tungding a ni sih a."
Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right.,"Hmûr felhai chu lalhai lâwm zâwng a na, Thudik hriltu chun an ngaina hlak."
The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it.,Lal lunginsenna chu thina thangkohai an nih; Mi var ruok chun sukdei a tih.
In the light of the king’s countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.,"Lal hmêl vara chun hringna a um a, A ditsakna chu ruo nuhnung sûm ang a nih."
"How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.","Varna nei hi rângkachak nêka ieng ang khieua ṭha lem am a na! Anih, hrietthiemna nei hi tangka nêka thlang lem ding a nih."
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.,Mi tluong lamtluongpui chu rîtlonaa inthawka fe hmang hi a na; Mi a lampui vêng ṭhatu chun a lungril chu a vawng ṭha.
"Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.","Chapona hi sietna hmaah a fe hlak a; Chun, lungril uong chu tlûkna hmaah."
"Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.","Mi chapohai le râllâk sum insem nêk chun, Mi inngaitlâwmhai le lungril inhnuoitaka um a ṭha lem."
"He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he.","Thu pawisatu chun thil ṭha hmûng a ta, LALPA ringtu chu, ama chu a hlim a nih."
The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.,"Lungrila var chu mi var ti nîng a ta, Hmûrhai thlumna chun thiemna chu a sukpung."
Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is their folly.,Hrietthiemna hi a neitu ta ding chun hringna tuihnâr a na; Invêthai inchûktirna ruok chu an invêtna a nih.
"The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips.",Mi var lungril chun ama bau ân chûktir a; A hmûrhaia chun thiemna a belsapêk hlak.
"Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.","Thu lâwmumhai chu khuoithlâr ang a na, Lungril ta dingin a thlum a, ruhai ta dingin hrisêlna a nih."
"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death.","Mihriem kuoma indik âwmtaka inlang lampui chu a um a, Chu tâwpna ruok chu thina lampuihai a nih."
The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him thereto.,"Mi sininrim phîngṭâmna chun ama ta dingin sin a thawh a, A bau chun ama chu a tirlui sih a."
A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.,"Mi hmangnabo chun pawitâwkna a rawtdawk a, A hmûrhaia chun mei em kâng thei ang chu a um a nih."
A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends.,"Mi dukindaklo chun inhalna a thedar a, Mi lâwtthiem chun ṭhien bulhai a sukṭhe."
"A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good.","Mi hrângsie chun a tuolbâwm chu a vethlêm a, Lampui ṭhaloa chun ama a ṭhuoi hlak."
"He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass.","Mithai insîmtu chun thil ṭha naw a remruot a, Hmûr inchîp tlattu chun thil suol chu ân tlungtir hlak."
The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness.,"Lu inṭuok chu ropuina lallukhum a na, Mi fel lampuia chun hmu nîng a tih."
"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.","Mi lunginsen intaktak chu mi thilthawtheitak nêkin a ṭha lem a, A lungril thunun theitu chu khawpui latu nêkin a ṭha lem."
The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.,"Ai chu mal chunga sân a ni hlak a, Thutlûkna ruok chu LALPA ta vawng a nih."
"Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of feasting with strife.","Inhal puma ruoiṭhe rawpna insûng nêk chun, Lungdamtaka bu bâr khat fâkna a ṭha lem."
"A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren.","Siehlaw vartaka thaw hlaktu chun naupa, inzakna intlun hlaktu, chunga chun rorêl a tih. Unauhai laiah rochan nei bawk a tih."
"The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But Jehovah trieth the hearts.","Rawtuina bêl chu tangkaruo ta ding a na, pûm mei chu rângkachak ta ding a nih, LALPA ruok chun lungril a fie hlak."
An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue.,"Thil suol thawtu chun hmûr khawhlohai chu a ngaisak a, Chun mi khêlinhlip chun lei pawitâwk tieng chun na a sit."
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.,Tukhawm mi pasie nuisan chun a siemtu a hmusit a nih. Vângduoina diriemtu chu hrem lo ni naw nih.
Children’s children are the crown of old men; And the glory of children are their fathers.,"Nauhai nauhai chu mi upahai lallukhum an na, Chun, nauhai ropuina chu an pahai chu an nih."
Excellent speech becometh not a fool; Much less do lying lips a prince.,"Thuhril ṭhatak le invêt ân mawi ngai nawh a, Hmûr khêlinhlip chu lal nau leh ân mawi naw nâwk zuol."
"A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.","Thamna hi a neitu ta ding chun mithaia lung hlutak ang a na, Ân her vêlna taphawta chun a hlawtling hlak."
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.,"Bawsietna inkhumtu chun hmangaina a zawng a, Thil hril hriltu ruok chun ṭhien bul a ṭhe."
A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool.,"Kâwkna hi hrietna nei mia chun a lût thûk lem, Invêt vawi za khat vuok nêk hmanin."
An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.,"Mi rilo chun hêlna chau a zawng a, Chuleiin, ama kuoma chun mitir nunsetak tir nîng a tih."
"Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly.","Invêt ân vêt laia intuokpui nêk chun, Savawmpui a tehai inrûkpêka um intuokpui nuom a um lem."
"Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house.","Tukhawm thil ṭha aia thil ṭha naw pe lem chu, Thil ṭha naw a ina inthawkin fe hmang ngai naw nih."
"The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.","Insuolna hung inṭan dân hi miin tui a hersuok ang chau a nih, Chuleiin, inhalna chu insuolna a um hmain mâksan rawh."
"He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.","Mi khawhlo chu thiem inchangtir a, mi fel chu thiemnaw inchangtir chu, Chu ve vehai chu angkhata LALPA ta dinga tirdakum a nih."
"Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he hath no understanding?","Hrietthiemna a nei naw chun, Varna inchâwkna man ding invêt kuta chun ieng dingin am um a ta?"
A friend loveth at all times; And a brother is born for adversity.,"Ṭhien chun ieng lai khawmin a hmangai a, Unau chu lunginzîng ni dinga pieng a nih."
"A man void of understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor.","Mi hrietthiemna nei lo chun a kuthai a ben a, A tuolbâwm hmaihmaa chun mawphurtu a hung ni hlak."
He loveth transgression that loveth strife: He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction.,"Bawsietna ngainatu chun inhalna khawm a ngaina a, A dâi kawtkhâr dawm sângtu chun sietna a zawng a nih."
He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good; And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.,"Lungril chapo neitu chun thil ṭha a hmu ngai nawh a, Lei khêlinhlip neitu chu pawitâwknaah a tlu lût hlak."
He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; And the father of a fool hath no joy.,"Nau invêt neitu chun a lungngaina chau dinga nei a na, Chun, invêt pa chun hlimna a nei bawk nawh."
A cheerful heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones.,"Lungril hlim chu damdawi ṭha a na, Lungril serawp ruok chun ruhai a sukṭâwl."
"A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice.","Mi khawhlo chun ângsûnga inthawkin thilthlâwnpêk chu a lâk a, Rorêlna lampuihai chu a sukkâwi hlak."
Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.,"Varna chu hrietthiemna neitu hmaihmaa chun a um a, Invêt mithai ruok chu leihnuoi tâwpa chun an um."
"A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bare him.","Naupa invêt chu a pa ta dinga lunginrimna a na, A neitu nu ta ding chun rimsikna a nih."
"Also to punish the righteous is not good, Nor to smite the noble for their uprightness.","Mi fel inchawitir chu a ṭha nawh a, Mi ṭha an tluongna leia vuok khawm chu a ṭha chuong nawh."
He that spareth his words hath knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.,"A thuhai hla tâwk nei mi chun hrietthiemna a nei a, Lungril dei nei mi chu hrietthiemna nei mi a nih."
"Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; When he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.","Invêt khawm, a to ṭawk lai chun mi vara ngai a na, A hmûrhai ân chip tlat lai chun mi var anga ngai a nih."
"He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom.","Mi mâni insuktum chun, mâni nuom zâwng ngei chu a zawng a, Varna indik po po a sêlkal hlak."
"A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself.","Invêt chun hrietthiemnaa chun lâwmna a nei nawh a, A lungrila ama le ama ân hmu suok theina chaua naw khan chu."
"When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy cometh reproach.","Mi khawhlo chu a hung pha chun hmusitna khawm a hung veh a, Tlâng ihrilsiet nina le chun kâwkna a hung bawk."
The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.,"Mihriem baua thuhai chu tui inthûkhai ang a na, Varna tuihnâr chu vadungtê luonglai ang a nih."
"To respect the person of the wicked is not good, Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment.","Mi khawhlo ditsak chu thil ṭha a ni nawh a, Rorêlnaa mi fel hnâwlhmang chu a ṭha chuong bawk nawh."
"A fool’s lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes.","Mi invêt hmûrhai chun inhalna ân tlun a, A bau chun vuoknahai a ko bawk."
"A fool’s mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul.","Mi invêt bau chu ama sietna a na, A hmûrhai chu a lungril ta dinga châng a nih."
"The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.","Mi lâwtthiem thuhai chu bubâr tuihnâitak ang an na, Phîng sûng hmun inthûktakhaiah an fe thla hlak."
He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer.,Ama sinthawa inthlada mi chu Suksetu unaupa chu a nih.
"The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.","LALPA hming chu kulbîng dettak a na, Mi fel chu chutaka chun a tlân lût a, a him hlak."
"The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination.","Mi hausa hausakna chu a khawpui dettak a na, Ama ngairuotnahaia ngei chun bang insâng ang a nih."
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor goeth humility.,"Sietna hmaah mihriem lungril chu a uong hlak a, Inzâkaina hmaa chun inngaitlâwmna a fe zie."
"He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him.","A hriet hmaa dawnna petu chu, A ta dingin inzakum le invêtna a nih."
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear?,"Mihriem lungril chun a hrât nawna chu chelngîr a ta, Lungril kawise ruok chu tuin am tuor thei a ta?"
The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.,"Mi var lungril chun hrietna a nei a, Mi var na chun thiemna a zawng bawk."
"A man’s gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men.","Mihriem thilthlâwnpêk chun ama ta dingin hmun a siempêk a, Ama chu mi ropuihai hmaah a hung ṭhuoi hlak."
He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out.,"Ama chungthu hril hmasatu chu indik âwmin ân lang a, Nisienlakhawm, a tuolbâwm chu a hung a, a hung phawr lang hlak."
"The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty.","Aisânna chun insêlnahai a sukbo a, Mi hrâthai chu a sukṭhe bawk."
A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; And such contentions are like the bars of a castle.,"Unaupa suklungawiloa um chu khawpui dettak nêkin hne ân tak lem, Chuong inhalnahai chu kula thîrtluonhai ang a nih."
A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.,"Mihriem phîng chu a baua rasuok chun suksip nîng a ta, A hmûrhaia hlawkna chun ama chu suklungawi ning a tih."
Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.,"Thina le hringna hi lei thilthawtheinaa um an na, Achu hmangaitu chun chutaka inthawka ra chu fâng a tih."
"Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah.","Tukhawm nuhmei hmutu chun thil ṭha a hmu a nih, LALPA ditsakna khawm a chang a nih."
The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly.,"Mi pasie chun ngênna thuhai a hmang hlak a, Mi hausa ruok chun tlahawltakin a dawn hlak."
He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.,"Ruolhai tamtak siemtu chun ama sietna ding el a thaw a nih, Amiruokchu, ruol unau nêka hnai lema kawp tlat chu a um a nih."
Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.,"Mi pasie lungril ṭhaa fetu chu, A hmûrhaia khêlinhlipa mi invêt nêk chun a ṭha lem."
"Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.","Lungril hrietthiemna bo khawm chu a ṭha chuong nawh a, Chun, a kehai tir inhmâwtu chun a suksuol hlak."
The foolishness of man subverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against Jehovah.,"Mihriem invêtna chun a lampui chu a sukkâwi a, A lungril chu LALPA chungah a lungsen hlak."
Wealth addeth many friends; But the poor is separated from his friend.,"Hausakna chun ruolhai tamtak a belsa a, Mi pasie ruok chu a ruola inthawka ṭhein a um."
A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall not escape.,"Thuhretu indik naw chu hrem lo ni naw ni a, Thukhêl sâksuoktu chun pumpel bawk naw nih."
Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.,"Mi tamtakin mi tiktlai ditsakna an ngên a, Mi tin chu thilthlâwnpêk petu ta dinga ruol a nih."
"All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth them with words, but they are gone.","Mi pasie chu a unauhai po poin an theida a, A ruolhai lem chun ieng ang khieua hla am an fe san ding chu! Thuhaiin anni a hnawt pei a; nisienlakhawm, an fe hmang tah."
He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: He that keepeth understanding shall find good.,"Varna hmutu chun ama lungril a hmangai a, Hrietthiemna vawngtu chun thil ṭha chu hmûng a tih."
A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall perish.,"Thuhretu indik naw chu hrem lo ni naw nih, Thukhêl sâksuoktu chu bohmang bawk a tih."
Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.,"Inhawi chên hi invêt ta ding chun a âwm nawh a, Siehlaw ta dingin lal nauhai chunga rorêl chu a âwm naw nâwk zuol a nih."
The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.,"Mihriem remruotthiemna hin ama chu lunginsen intak dingin a siem a, Bawsietna fe khêl chu ama ta dingin chawimawina a nih."
The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew upon the grass.,"Lal lunginsenna chu sakeibak- nei inrûm ri ang a na, A ditsakna ruok chu hlohna chunga daidaw ang a nih."
A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.,"Naupa invêt chu a pa lunginrimna a na, Nuhmei lungawinawna chu ruo sûr zing ang a nih."
House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.,"In le hausaknahai hi thlatu- haia inthawka rochan an na, Nuhmei var ruok hi chu LALPAA inthawk a nih."
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.,"Thabona chu imu inhniktakah ân peilût a, Mi thabo chun phîngṭâm tuor a tih."
He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; But he that is careless of his ways shall die.,"Thupêk vawngtu chun a lung- ril chu a vawng ṭha a na, A lampuihaia fîmkhur lo chu thîng a tih."
"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, And his good deed will he pay him again.","Mi pasie lunginsiettu chun LALPA ân pûktir a na, A thil thaw ṭha chu ama chun pe nâwk a tih."
"Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; And set not thy heart on his destruction.","Beiseina a la um laiin i naupa chu thunun la, A sietna ding êm chun lungril nei naw rawh."
"A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty; For if thou deliver him, thou must do it yet again.","Mi lunginsen êm êm mi chun hremna chu tuor a ta, Ama chu i sansuok chun, i sansuok nâwk pei a ṭûl ding a ni sih a."
"Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.","Thurâwn chu ngai la, inchûktirna chu pawm rawh, I hihnung tâwp tienga i hung var theina dingin."
"There are many devices in a man’s heart; But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand.","Mihriem lungrila chun remruotna tamtak a um a, Amiruokchu, LALPA thurâwn chau chu ngîrsuok a tih."
That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar.,"Mihriem nuom zâwng chu a lunginsietna inkhina a na, Mi pasie chu mi khêlhlip nêkin a ṭha lem."
The fear of Jehovah tendeth to life; And he that hath it shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil.,"LALPA ṭîna chun hringna ân tlun a, Chu chu neitu chu tlaitakin um a ta, Thil ṭha naw hrimin ama chu sir ngai naw nih."
"The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.","Mi thabo chun thlênga chun a kut chu a phûm a, A baua hang thun takngiel khawm chu a pei nawh."
"Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.","Hmusittu chu vaw la, mi mâwl chun var inchûk a tih, Hrietthiemna nei mi chu kâwk la, hrethiem a tih."
"He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother, Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach.","A pa suksetu chun a nu chu a hnawt hmang a na, Ama chu kâwkna le inzakna intlungtir hlaktu naupa chu a nih."
"Cease, my son, to hear instruction Only to err from the words of knowledge.","Ka naupa, hrietthiemna thuhaia inthawka pêthmangna ding chau a, Inchûktirnahai ngaithlâk hi tâwp san rawh."
A worthless witness mocketh at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.,"Thuhretu hmangnabo chun rorêlna a nuisan a, Mi khawhlo bau chun suolna a lem."
"Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools.","Rorêlnahai hi hmusittuhai ta dinga buotsai an na, Vuoknahai hi invêt ruongzâng ta dingin."
"My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;","Ka naupa, ka thuhai hi i pawm a, Nangmaa ka thupêkhai hi i siekhâwl a,"
"So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding;","Chuonga varna tienga i na chu i sit a, Hrietthiemna tienga i lungril chu i hmang chun;"
"Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;","Anih, ngairuotdikna chu i ko a, Hrietthiemna koa i râwl în suo bawk a,"
"If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:","Tangka anga i zawng a, Ro phûm rûkhai anga i zawng suok chun;"
"Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God.","LALPA ṭitna chu hung hre tâng i ta, Pathien hrietna chu hmu suok tâng i tih."
For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:,LALPA chun varna a pêk sih a; A baua inthawk chun hrietna le hrietthiemna hung suok a tih.
He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;,Mi tluong ta ding chun varna hrisêl chu a siekhâwl a; Lungril ṭhataka fetuhai ta ding chun phaw a nih.
"That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.","Rorêlna lampuihai chu a vênghim theina ding le, A mi inthienghai lampui chu a vawngṭhatna dingin."
"Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.","Chun, rorêlna le felna chu hung hrethiem tâng i ta, Thlierbîk nei nawna chu, anih, lampui ṭha tinrêng el le chun."
"For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;","Varna chu i lungrila chun hung lût a ta, I hringna ta ding chun hrietna chu inhawitina nîng a tih."
Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:,"Ngairuot thiemna chun nangma chu vêng a ti cheh a, Hrietthiemna chun kawl tlat a ti che;"
"To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;","Mi rilo lampuia inthawka sansuok ding che le, Thil khawhlohai hriltuhaia inthawka sansuok ding chein;"
"Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;","Inthimna lampui hraw dinga, Felna lampuihai nghatsantuhaia inthawk le,"
"Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;","Rîtlona thaw kawnga hlimtuhai, Mi rilo khawhlonaa lâwm hlaktuhaia inthawk le,"
"Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:","An lampuihaia mi kâwihai, An lampuihai pêtsantuhaia inthawkin."
"To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;","Hmêlmak nuhmeia inthawka sansuok ding chein, A bâuthluma zaihlêmtu che, ram dang mi ngeia inthawk chun;"
"That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:","A tleirâwl lai ṭhien chu nghatsan a, A Pathien thuthlung theinghiltua inthawk chun."
"For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;","A in chun thina chu ân nghâi zing a, A lampuihai chu thinaah:"
"None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:","A mânu kuoma fetu chu tukhawm an hung kîr nâwk ta nawh a, Hringna lampuihai khawm chu an pâw phâk ngai bawk nawh;"
"That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.","Mi ṭhahai lampui chu i hraw theina ding le, Mi fel lampuihai chu i hraw theina dingin."
"For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it.","Mi tluong chu rama chun chêng a ta, Mi ṭha famkim chu a um zing ding a ni sih a."
"But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.","Nisienlakhawm, mi khawhlo chu rama inthawka sât thlâk nîng a ta, Bawsetuhai chu amaa inthawk chun zunga phawi hmangin um an tih."
"Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise.","Uoin hi nuisantu a na, zu hi mi risie a nih, Tukhawm chutaka suksuoltu chu a var naw a nih."
The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life.,"Lal ṭiumna chu sakeibaknei inrûm ri ang a na, Ama suklungsentu chun ama hringna chunga ngei chun thil a suksuol a nih."
It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling.,"Insuolnaa inthawka insietum hi mihriem ta dingin inzâkaina a na, Amiruokchu, invêt taphawthai chu insêl an tih."
"The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.","Mi thabo chun thlasik leiin hnuoi inlet naw nih a, Chuleiin, busîk pha chun kut dâwng a ta, iengkhawm nei naw nih."
Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out.,"Mihriem lungrila thurâwn hi tui inthûk ang a na, Amiruokchu, hrietthiemna nei mi chun chawi suok a tih."
Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find?,"Mi tamtak chun mâni ṭhatna hril seng an ta, Mi ringum ruok chu tuin am hmu suok thei a ta?"
"A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him.","Mi indik a lungril ṭhaa fe mi chu, Ama hnunga a thlahai chu an hamṭha."
A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.,"Rorêlna lalṭhungphaa lal ṭhung chun, A mithaiin thil ṭha naw po po a hnawt dar."
"Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?","Tuin am, “Ka lungril chu ka sukthieng a, Ka suolnaa inthawkin kân thieng tah” ti thei a ta?"
"Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.","Bûkna danglamhai, inkhîna danglamhai, Chuhai ve ve chu angkhata LALPA ta dinga tirdakum a nih."
"Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.","Naupang hmanin a thilthaw- haiin ama le ama ân suklang hlak, A sinthaw chu ân thieng amanih, ân dik amani khawm ni sien."
"The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.","Hrietna na le, hmuna mit chu, Chuhai ve ve chu LALPA siem an nih."
"Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.","Zâl hmakhuo ngai naw ta, tlâksamnaah lût rawi i tih, I mithai chu meng la, chuong- chun, beia suktlai nîng i tih."
"It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.","“A ni nawh, a ni nawh” inchawtu chun a tih a, A fe hmang pha ruok chun a uong hlak."
"There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.","Rângkachak le lung mantam tamtak a um a, Amiruokchu, hrietna hmûrhai chu lunghlu hlutak an nih."
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners.,"Hmêlmak mi ta dingin a aiaw dingin a silfên la la, Chun, nuhmei hmêlmak mi ta ding chun ama chu aiawah hrên rawh."
Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.,"Indik nawna bei hi mihriem ta dingin a thlum a, A hnunga ruok chun a bau chu phaiphinin sip a tih."
Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war.,"Thiltum tinrêng chu thurâwna tungding a na, Ṭhuoina var leh indona chu siem rawh."
He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips.,"Mi bautam invâk vêltu chun thurûkhai a phuong a, Chuleiin, a bau ka lientu chu va pâwl naw rawh."
"Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.","Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih ṭawngse inphurtu chu, A khâwnvar chu inthim sâmup- na laia chun her hlum nîng a tih."
An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed.,"A tira chun rochan chu inhmâwtaka chang thei nîng a ta, Amiruokchu, chu tâwpna chu malsâwmpêk ni naw nih."
"Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee.","“Thil ṭha naw chu thung ka tih,” nangin ti naw la, LALPA chu nghâk la, ama chun sandam a ti che."
Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good.,"Bûkna danglamhai chu LALPA ta dingin tirdakum a na, Bûkkhaina indik naw khawm chu a ṭha nawh."
A man’s goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way?,"Mihriem fenahai chu LALPA ta a na, Chuong a ni chun, miin iengtin am mâni lampui chu hre thei a ta?"
"It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, And after vows to make inquiry.","“ân thieng a nih,” hang ti thlâk rawk el hi mihriem ta dingin châng a na, Inkhâmnahai hnunga hrietchiengna siem le hin."
"A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the threshing-wheel over them.","Lal var chun mi khawhlohai chu a hnawt dar a, Bu chîlna tawlailîr kekuol chu an chungah a hung lâk."
"The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts.","Mihriem lungril chu Pathien khâwnvar a na, Phîngsûng hmun inthûktakhai po po chu a zawng suok hlak."
Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness.,"Lunginsietna le thutak hin lal chu a vawngṭha a, A lalṭhungpha khawm chu zângainaa tungding a nih."
The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.,"Tlangvâlhai ropuina chu an hrâtna hi a na, Mi upahai mawina chu an lu inṭuok hi a nih."
Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes reach the innermost parts.,"Hliem khawpa vuokna chun thil ṭha naw a sukfai a, Vuoknahai chun phing sûng sûngril hmunhai chu a sukfai."
The king’s heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever he will.,"Lal lungril chu tui luong ruomhai angin LALPA kuta chun a um a, Ama nuomna tieng tieng a hêm hlak."
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the hearts.,"Mihriem lampui tin el chu ama mithmua chun ân dik a, Amiruokchu, LALPA chun lungril chu ân khi hlak a nih."
To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice.,"Rorêlna le thil fel thaw hi, Inthâwina nêkin LALPA ta dingin pawmtlâk a ni lem dai."
"A high look, and a proud heart, Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin.","Meng insâng le lungril chapo, Mi khawhlo khâwnvar ngei khawm chu suol a nih."
The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want.,"Mi taima ngaituonahai chun hau hnawkna a âwn a, Amiruokchu, mi tin inhmaw ta hrim hrim chu tlasam ding chaua inhmaw a nih."
The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death.,"Lei khêlinhlip leia hausakna hmu chu, Hmatieng hnungtienga tuihu lên hmanga um ang chu a na, a zawngtuhai chun thina an zawng a nih."
"The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice.","Mi khawhlo hrângsietna chun anni chu hrût hmang a tih, Rorêlna indik thaw an nuom naw leiin."
"The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right.","Mi khawhlo lampui chu a kâwi hle a, Mi inthieng sinthaw ruok chu a tluong a nih."
"It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.","Nuhmei hrângsie le in liena um nêk chun, Inchung sîp kilkhâwra chêng chu a ṭha lem."
The soul of the wicked desireth evil: His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes.,"Mi khawhlo lungril chun thil suol a châk a, A mithmua chun a tuolbâwm chun ditsakna hrim a hmu nawh."
"When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.","Hmusittu chu hrem a ni pha chun, mi mâwl chu sukvar a na, Mi var chu inchûktir a ni pha chun, hrietna a hmu hlak."
"The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked, How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin.",Mi fel chun mi khawhlo sûng- kuo chu a ngaituo hlak a; Iengtizieha mi khawhlohai chu an sietnaa pei thlâk am an niha ti hi.
"Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry, but shall not be heard.","Tukhawm mi pasie khêk ria a nahai suksêt chu, Ama khawm khêk ngei a ta, amiruokchu, ngai ni naw nih."
"A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath.","A rûka thilthlâwnpêk hin lunginsenna a sukre a, Ângsûnga thilpêk hin lungin- senna nasatak a sukre."
It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.,"Rorêlna indik hi mi fel ta ding chun hlimum a na, Thil suol thawtuhai ta ding ruok chun sietna a nih."
The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the assembly of the dead.,Mi hrietthiemna lampuia inthawka invâkhmang chu Mithihai inkhâwmnaa chun châwl a tih.
He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.,"Nuomsipna ngaina mi chu mi pasie nîng a ta, Uoin le hriek ngaina mi chu hausa ngai naw nih."
The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright.,"Mi khawhlo chu mi fel ta dinga intlanna a na, Bawsetu chu mi tluong aiawin a hung bawk."
"It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman.","Nuhmei awnazawng le hrângsie le um nêkin, Thlalêr rama um a ṭha lem."
There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up.,"Mi var chêngnaa chun hriek le hausakna hlutak chu a um a, Mi invêt ruok chun a lem zo hlak."
"He that followeth after righteousness and kindness Findeth life, righteousness, and honor.","Zângaina le felna hnawttu chun, Hringna, felna le inzâkaina a hmu hlak."
"A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof.","Mi var chun mi hrât khawpui chu ân khih a, Chutaka inringzona hrâtna chu a sukhnuoi hlak."
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles.,"Tukhawm a lei le a bau vêng ṭha chun, Buoinahaia inthawkin a lungril chu a vêng ṭha a nih."

Fervent lips and a wicked heart Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.,"Hmûr zumlezuor intuo le lungril suol chu, Pil bêl rângkachak êka inluon ang a nih."

Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman.,"Hmêlmak mi ta dingin a aiawtu silfên la la, Nuhmei hmêlmak mi ta dinga mawphurtua insiem chu aiawah chel rawh."
"He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him.","Zîngkâra tho a, a ruolpa ta dinga râwl inringtaka malsâwmtu chu, Ama ta ding chun ṭawngsiea ngai nîng a tih."

For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by men of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.,"Ramin a bawsiet pha chu rorêl- tu tamtak a hung nei hlak a, Nisienlakhawm, hrietna le hrietthiemna nei mihai lei chun ram chu ngirsuok a tih."
A needy man that oppresseth the poor Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.,"Mi tlasam mi pasie nêksâwrtu chu, Ruo pheisûr bu hla lo ang chu a nih."

"He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.","Dân chu ngai dinga a na sit nawtu chu, A ṭawngṭâina khawm chu tirdakum a nih."

To have respect of persons is not good; Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread.,"Mihai thlierbîkna nei hi a ṭha nawh a, Bei hlek lei mei meiin min a bawsiet bawk ding a ni nawh."
"He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.","Mit rilo neitu chun hausakna- hai a bawin a bawh a, Tlâksamna a chungah a hung tlung ding a nih ti a hriet nawh."

A man that flattereth his neighbor Spreadeth a net for his steps.,"Mi a tuolbâwm inpâkdertu chun, A kalchawihai ta dingin lên a pha a nih."

The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor; The wicked hath not understanding to know it.,"Mi fel chun mi pasie chungthu chu a hrietpui hlak a, Mi khawhlo chun hre dingin hrietthiemna a nei nawh."
Scoffers set a city in a flame; But wise men turn away wrath.,"Mi hmusittuhai chun khawpui chu meiin an rawh a, Mi varhai ruok chun lunginsen- na an hnawt hmang."
"If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man, Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest.","Mi varin mi invêt ân khingpui chun, A lunginsenin amanih, ân nuiin amani khawm, sâwldam um naw nih."

"The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, His throne shall be established for ever.","Lal, mi pasiehai ringumtaka ro rêlpêk hlaktu chu, A lalṭhungpha chu kumkhuoin tungding nîng a tih."

"An angry man stirreth up strife, And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.","Mi lunginsen chun inkhingna a chawktho a, Mi lungsen hmang chu bawsietnain a sip a nih."
A man’s pride shall bring him low; But he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honor.,"Mi chu a chapona chun ama chu sukhnuoi a ta, Lungrila inngaitlâwm ruok chun chawimawina hmûng a tih."
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing.,"Rûkru inṭâwmpuina neitu chun ama lungril ngei khawm a theida hlak a, Ṭawngsie inphurna ri chu a hriet hlak a chu iengkhawm a sâksuok ngai nawh."
The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.,"Mihriem ṭîna hin châng a hung siem a, LALPAA a ringna innghattu ruok chu him a tih."
Many seek the ruler’s favor; But a man’s judgment cometh from Jehovah.,"Mi tamtakin rorêltu ditsakna chu an zawng hlak a, Amiruokchu, mihriem rorêlna chu LALPAA inthawka hung a nih."
An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.,"Mi indik naw chu mi fel ta dingin tirdakum a ni a, Mi tluong chu mi khawhlo ta dingin tirdakum a ni ve thung."
"My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments:","Ka naupa, ka inchûktirna hi theinghil naw la, Ka thupêkhai hi i lungrilin vawng tlat lem raw se:"
"For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.","Nihai seina le dam sûng kumhai, Thlamuongna leh an belsa ding che a ni sih a."
Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:,"Lunginsietna le thudik chun nghatsan naw sienla che: I rîngah vêt tlat la, I lungril phêk chunga chun ziek rawh."
So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.,"Chuongchun, mihriem le Pathien mithmuah, Hrietthiemna ṭha le ditsakna hmûng i tih."
"Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:","I lungril po poin LALPA chu ring la, Nanga hrietthiemna ringawta chun innghat naw rawh."
"In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.","I lampuihai po poa chun ama hre zing la, Amân i lampuihai chu suktluong a tih."
"Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:","Nanga mithaia ringawt chun var naw la, LALPA chu ṭi la, rîtlona chu mâksan rawh."
"It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.","I laibua dingin hrisêlna nîng a ta, I ruhai ta dingin thlin."

"So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.","Chuongchun,i bu inhai chu tamtaka suksip nîng a ta, I sâwrna khurhai chu uoin tharin luong liem a tih."
"My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:","Ka naupa, LALPA thununna chu ngainêp naw la, A kâwkna chu ngaitha bawk naw rawh."
"For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.",LALPA chun a hmangai chu a kâwk hlak a; Naupa a ilâwm chunga pain a kâwk ang elin.
"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.","Varna hmu suok mi chu a hlim a, Hrietthiemna nei mi chu a hlim a nih."
"For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.","Chu thuomhnaw chu tangka thuomhnaw nêkin a ṭha lem a, Chutaka hlâwk khawm chu rângkachak inthieng nêkin a ṭha lem sih a."
She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.,Lunghluhai nêkin a hlu lem a; Thil i dit theihai a ieng ieng le khawm chun hrilkhi ruol a ni nawh.
Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.,A kut changtieng chun nihai seina chu a um a; A kut vawitieng chun hausaknahai le inzaumna an um bawk a.
"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.","A lampuihai chu inhawitirna lampui an na, A lampuihai po po chu thlamuongna a nih."
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.,"Ama cheltuhai ta ding chun hringna thing kûng a na, Ama kawl tlat theitu chu a hlim a nih."
Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.,LALPA chun varnain hnuoi chu a hmu suok a; Hrietthiemnain vânhai chu ân ngîr bawk a.
"By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.","A hrietnain lithûkhai chu a sukdar a, Vânhai chun daidâw an insûrtir a."
"My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:","Ka naupa, i mithmuhaia inthawk chun anni chu infehmangtir naw la, Ngairuotthiemna le varna hrisêl chu kawl tlat rawh."
"So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.","Chuongchun, i thlarau ta dingin hringna nîng an ta, I rîng ta dingin zângaina nîng an tih."
"Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble.","Chun, i lampuiah himtakin fe tâng i ta, I ke khawm insui ta naw nih."
"When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.","I zâl pha khawm chun, ṭi ta naw ti nih a, Anih, zâl i ta, îmu inhniktakin in i tih."
"Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:","Ṭina thut chu ṭi naw la, Mi khawhlo sukṭitna a hung pha khawm ṭi bawk naw rawh."
"For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken.","LALPA chu i ringsan nîng a ta, I ke chu lâk hmangnaa inthawkin a vêng ding a ni sih a."

"Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.","Nang a sukpawi naw che chun, A san boin mi insukbuoipui naw rawh."
"Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.","Mi nunrâwng chu inhnar naw la, A lampuihai hrim hrim chu thlang ngai naw rawh;"
For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright.,Khêlinhlipna hi LALPA ngaia chun tirdakum a ni sih a. A thurâwn ruok chu mi tluong kuomah a um.
The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.,"LALPA ṭawngsie chu mi khawhlo inah a um a, Mi fel chêngna ruok chu mal a sâwm hlak."
Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.,"Hmusittuhai chu a hmusit ngei ngei a, Inngaitlâwmhai ruok chu zângaina a pêk hlak."
The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.,"Mi var chun ropuina chu hluong a ta, Amiruokchu, invêthai kaisângna chu inzakna nîng a tih."
"The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the oracle. The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:","Jake naupa Agur thuhai chu: thuvar chu. Mi chun Ithiel kuomah a hril a, Ithiel le Ukal kuoma chun: “Aw Pathien, kei le kei kân nghawk a,"

"And I have not learned wisdom, Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.","Chun, varna khawm chu kân chûk nawh a, Mi Inthieng hrietna khawm chu ka nei bawk nawh."
"Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in his garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?","Tu am vâna chun a hang lâwnin a hung ṭum leh? Tuin am a kuttum sûngah thli chu a siekhâwl hlak a?

Every word of God is tried: He is a shield unto them that take refuge in him.,"Pathien thu tin chu sukthiengin a um a, Ama ringtuhai ta ding chun ama chu phaw a nih."
"Add thou not unto his words, Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.","A thuhai chu nang chun belsa naw la, Kâwk rawi a ti cheh a, khêlinhlip i nih ti hmu suok ni rawi a tih."
Two things have I asked of thee; Deny me them not before I die:,"Thil pahni ka hni cheh a, Ka thi hma hin mi hung inphatpêk tâwl naw rawh."
Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is needful for me:,"Keimaa inthawka hlatakah teplo nina le khêlhlipna hi sawnhmang la, Hausakna amanih, pasietna amani khawm mi pe naw rawh; Keia ta dinga pawimaw bu chun mi châwm lem rawh."
"Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor, and steal, And use profanely the name of my God.","Ka hung tlai hin inphat ka ti cheh a “LALPA chu tu am a na?” ti hlau rawi ka tih, Annawleh, ka hung pasiet hin inru rawi ka ta, Ka Pathien hming hi hrilsiet- nain hmang rawi ka tih."

"There is a generation that curse their father, And bless not their mother.","Thla pakhat an thlatuhai hrilse hlak chu an um a, An nuhai khawm chu mal an sâwm bawk nawh."

"The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, Yea, four that say not, Enough:","Lît chun naunuhmei pahni “Mi pe, mi pe” tiha khêk khêkhai chu a nei a, Thil pathum khawptâwk ngai hrim hrim lo chu an um a, Anih, pali “A huntâwk” ti ngailohai chu an um a."

"The eye that mocketh at his father, And despiseth to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley shall pick it out, And the young eagles shall eat it.","Mit a pa chu nuisan a, A nu thu awi dinga hmusittu chu, Phairuom vaâkhai chun kheldawk an ta; Mulukawlhai chun fâng an tih."
"There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yea, four which I know not:","Keia ta dinga thil mak taluo pathum an um a, Anih, pali ka hriet lohai chu;"
The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent upon a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a man with a maiden.,"Boruoka muvânlai lampui chu; Lungpui chunga rûlpui lampui chu; Tuisuoriet laia lawng lampui chu; Chun, pasal le nunghâk lampui le chun."
"So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, And saith, I have done no wickedness.","Nuhmei uire lampui khawm chuong ang bawk chu a na, A fâk a, a hmûr chu a hrûk a, “Thil suol ka thaw nawh,” a ti nâwk a."
"For three things the earth doth tremble, And for four, which it cannot bear:","Leihnuoi hi thil pathum leiin ân thin hlak a, Chun, pali, a tuor zo naw chu a um a."
For a servant when he is king; And a fool when he is filled with food;,Siehlaw chu lal a hung ni pha chun; Mi invêt chu fâk dinga suksipa a um pha chun;
For an odious woman when she is married; And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.,"Nuhmei hrângsie pasal a nei pha le chun; Chun, siehlawnu chu a pi rohluotu a hung ni le chun."

"The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;","Zupui hi a ruol hrât lotak an na, Anachu, an inhai chu lungpuihaia chun an siem."
"The locusts have no king, Yet go they forth all of them by bands;","Khâuṭhikṭhihai hin lal an nei nawh a, Anachu, an rêngin a pâwlin an fe suok."
"The lizard taketh hold with her hands, Yet is she in kings’ palaces.","Chawlru hi a kuthaia incheltâng el a na chu, Ama chu lal in ropuiahai chun a um hlak."

"Give not thy strength unto women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.","Nuhmeihai kuoma chun i hrâtna pe naw la, Lalhai sukbohmang hlaktu kuoma chun i lampuihai pe bawk naw rawh."

"Lest they drink, and forget the law, And pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.","Inrui hlau an ta, dân chu theinghil an ta, Suknawmnata um tukhawm ta dinga rorêlna chu her kâwi hlau an tih."
"Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, And wine unto the bitter in soul:","Bohmang el dinga inzosa zing kuoma chun zu chu pe la, Lungrila rimsi kuoma chun uoin chu pe rawh."
"Let him drink, and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more.","Indâwntir la, a tlâksamna chu theinghil raw se, A pasietna chu hre zing bawk ta naw raw se."
"Open thy mouth for the dumb, In the cause of all such as are left desolate.","Ṭawngtheilo ta ding chun i bau ka la, Chuong ang po po chungthua chun rausana mâksan an nih."
"Open thy mouth, judge righteously, And minister justice to the poor and needy.","I bau chu ka la, feltakin ro chu rêl la, Chun, tlasamhai le pasiehai ta ding chun rorêlna rawng chu bâwl rawh."
A worthy woman who can find? For her price is far above rubies.,Nuhmei ringum chu tuin am hmu thei a ta? A hlutna chu lung mantamhai nêkin ân sâng dai sih a.
"The heart of her husband trusteth in her, And he shall have no lack of gain.","A pasal lungril chun ama chu a ring a, Hlâwkna tlâksamna hrim hrim nei naw nih."
She doeth him good and not evil All the days of her life.,"Amanu chun a dam sûng nihaia po po chun, Ama chu a thaw ṭhah a, a sukṭha naw ngai nawh."
"She seeketh wool and flax, And worketh willingly with her hands.","Pat le sahmul dâm chu a zawng a, A kuthai chun thafântakin sin a thaw hlak."
She is like the merchant-ships; She bringeth her bread from afar.,"Amanu chu sumdâwng mi lawnghai ang a na, Hlataka inthawkin a bu chu a hung lâk hlak."
"She riseth also while it is yet night, And giveth food to her household, And their task to her maidens.","Zân a lân thim lai khawmin a tho a, A sûngkuohai ta ding chun bu a pêk hlak a, A siehlawnuhai ta dingin an chanpuol chu a pêk hlak."

"She layeth her hands to the distaff, And her hands hold the spindle.","A kuthai chu sûthlâmah ân nghat a, A kuthai chun hmuithal chu a chel a."
"She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.","Mi pasiehai tienga chun a kut chu a phar a; Anih, mi tlasamhai chu a kuthai chu ân tlungtir hlak."
She is not afraid of the snow for her household; For all her household are clothed with scarlet.,"A insûng ta ding chun vûr chu a ṭi nawh a, A insûng sûngkuohai po po chu sen inlâra inthuom an ni sih a."
She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.,"Ama ta ding chun puon kawp ta ṭiel ṭhungphahai a siem a, A silfên chu puon zai inhmi kawp dumpâwl a nih."
"Her husband is known in the gates, When he sitteth among the elders of the land.","Daikawtkhârhaia chun a pasal chu hriet a na, Ram upahai laia a ṭhung lai khawm chun."
"She maketh linen garments and selleth them, And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.","Puon zai inhmi silfênhai a siem a, a zawr a, Dâwrkaihai kuoma chun kâwngkhihai a pêk a."
Strength and dignity are her clothing; And she laugheth at the time to come.,"Hrâtna le inzaumna chu a silfên an na, Hun la hung tlunga ding khawm chun ân nui a."
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; And the law of kindness is on her tongue.,Varna leh a bau chu a kah a; Lunginsietna inchûktirna chu a leia chun a um a.
"She looketh well to the ways of her household, And eateth not the bread of idleness.","A insûng ta dinga lampuihai chu ṭhatakin a en a, Thabona bei hrim hrim chu a fâk ngai nawh."
"Her children rise up, and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying:","A nauhai chu an tho a, ama chu vângnei an ta, A pasal khawm chun, ama chu ân pâk a;"
"Many daughters have done worthily, But thou excellest them all.","“Naunuhmei tamtakhai chun ringumtakin an thaw tah a; Amiruokchu, nang chun an rêngin i khûm vawng a,” tiin."
"Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; But a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.","Ditsakna hi hmusitum a na, mawina khawm hi teplo mei mei a nih, Amiruokchu, nuhmei LALPA ṭitu chu, ama chu inpâkin um a tih."
Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates.,"A kuthai rasuok chu ama chu pe la, Dâikawtkhârhaia chun a sinthawhai chun ama chu inpâk raw se."
"Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:","Ka naupasalhai, pa inchûktirna hi lo ngai unla, Hrietthiemna hre dingin ngaisak ro."
For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law.,"Thuinchûktir ṭha chu ka pêk si cheu a, Ka inchûktirna hi nghatsan naw ro."
"For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.","Ka pa ta dingin naupasal ka na, Ka nu mithmua chun duotum le dittak ka ni ngâwk a."
"And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;","Chun, a mîn chûktir a, ka kuomah a hril a, “Ka thuhai hi i lungril invawngtir zing la; Ka thupêkhai hi vawng la, hring rawh;"
"Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;","Varna hung nei la, hrietthiemna khawm hung nei rawh, Theinghil hlek naw la, ka baua suok thuhaia inthawkin in- tâwl hmang bawk naw rawh;"
"Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee.","Ama chu nghatsan naw la, vawngṭhâng a ti cheh a, Ama chu hmangai la, vêng a ti che."
"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.","Varna chu thil bulpui tak a na, chuleiin, varna nei rawh; Anih, i nei tasahai po poa chun hrietthiemna nei rawh."
"Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.","Ama chu chawimawi la, ama chun inkaisângtir a ti che, Ama i pawm chun inzaumtakin siem a ti che."
She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.,"I lua dingin zângaina lukhum pêng a ti cheh a, Mawina lallukhum pêng a ti che,” tiin."
"Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many.","Aw ka naupa, ngai la, ka thuhrilhai hi lo pawm la, I dam sûng kumhai chu tamtak hung nîng a tih."
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.,Varna lampuia chun kân chûktir ta cheh a; Felna lampuihaia chun ka ṭhuoi ta che a nih.
"When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.","I fe pha chun, i kalchawihai chu zâng a ta; Chun, i tlân khawmin, insui naw ti nih."
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life.,"Inchûktirna chu cheldet tlat la, infetir dêr naw rawh; Kawl tlat rawh, ama chu i hringna a ni sih a."
"Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men.","Mi khawhlo lampuia chun lût naw la, Mi rilohai lampui chu hraw naw rawh."
"Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.","Pumpel la, achun fe dêr naw; Chutaka inthawk chun inherhmang la, fe pei rawh."
"For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.","Thil pawi an thaw zet naw chun an in ngai si nawh a; Mi ṭhenkhat bêk an sukthlûk naw chun, an îmu chu lâk hmang a ni hlak."
"For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.","Khawhlona bei chu an fâkin, Nunrâwngna uoin chu an dâwn hlak sih a."
"But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.","Mi fel lampui ruok chu zîng khawvar ang a na, Sûn chang lai chena var deu deu ang chu."
The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble.,"Mi khawhlohai lampui chu inthimna ang a na, Ieng âm an insui ti khawm an hriet nawh."
"My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings.","Ka naupa, ka thuhai hi pawisa la, Ka thuhrilhai tieng hin i na chu sit rawh."
Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart.,"I mithmua inthawk infe hmangtir naw la, I lungril sûng taka chun kawl tlat rawh."
"For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh.","A hmutuhai ta dingin hringna an na, An taksa ta dingin hrisêlna an ni sih a."
Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.,"Fîmkhur thei tâwpin i lungril chu vêng ṭha rawh, Chutaka inthawk chun hringna rasuokhai chu a um sih a."
"Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee.","Ṭawng ki nei hrim chîng naw la, Khêl hril chu bân dai rawh."
"Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.","I mithai chun hmatieng chau en sienla, I khaw nghat chun i hmatieng thlîr tlat raw se."
"Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established.","Ngaiven dêkin i kal chawi la, I lampui chu sukdet ni raw se."
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil.,"Changtieng khawm, vawitieng khawm pêt naw la, Suola inthawk i ke her hmang rawh."
"My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:","Ka naupa, ka varna hi pawisa la, Ka hrietthiemna tieng hin i na sit rawh,"
"That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.","Ngairuotthiemna chu i vawng tlat theia, I hmûrhai chun hrietna a kawl tlat theina dingin."
"For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:","Hmêlmak nuhmei hmûrhai chu khuoizuin a far a, A bau chu hriek nêkin ân nâl lem sih a."
"But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.","A tâwptieng ruok chu sairam khâkin a kha a, Kâwlhnâm ngeituo angin a ngei a."
Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;,"A kehai chu thinaah a fe thla a, A kalchawihai chun Seol a sir hlak."
"So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, and she knoweth it not.","Chuongchun, hringna lampui inphei chu a hmu ngai nawh a, A lampuihai chu mumal neilo a na, ama chun a hriet nawh."
"Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.","Chuleiin, tuhin ka naupasalhai, mi lo ngai unla, Ka baua thuhaia inthawk hin fe hmang naw ro."
"Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;","Amanua inthawk chun in lam- pui chu hlataka sawn unla, A in kawtkhâr hnaia khawm fe naw ro."
"Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;","Mi danghai kuomah in inzaumna chu pe hlau in ta, Mi bengtlalo kuoma chun in kumhai chu pe hlau rawi in tih."
"Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors be in the house of an alien,","Hmêlmakhai chu in hrâtnaa suksipin um an ta, In sininrimnahai chu hmêlmak- hai inah ni hlau rawi a tih."
"And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,","In hun tâwp tieng chun inrûm in ta, In taksa le in tisa chu hmangzo a ni pha chun."
"And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;","Chun, “Iengtiziea inchûktirna kha ka lo theida a, Ka lungrilin kâwkna kha a lo ngainêp am a ni aw!"
"Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!","Ka inchûktirtuhai râwl khawm ka awi ngai nawh a, Kei a mîn chûktirtuhai tienga khawm ka na khawm ka sit ngai nawh a:"
I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.,"Siet let dêrna ka lo tlung ṭêp an nâwm ie, Inkhâwmpui pâwlpui laia chun,” ti rawi i tih."
"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.","I tuibêl ngeia tui le, I tuisunsuo ngeia tui luong chu dâwn rawh."
"Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?","I tuihnârhai chu inluongdartira umin, Khawlaidungahai chun vadungpui tui chu ân dar el ding maw?"
"Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee.","Nangma ta bîk chau ni sienla, I kuoma hmêlmak mihai ta ding ni loin,"
Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.,"I tuikhur chu malsâwmin um sienla, I tleirâwl lai nuhmeia chun hlim rawh."
"As a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love.","Sazukpui ditumtak le sakhipui inhawititak angin, Ienglai khawmin a nenêhai chun suktlai rawp sienla che; A hmangainaa chun nang chu thafân rawp hlak rawh."
"For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?","Chuongchun, nang ka naupa, iengdingin am hmêlmak nuhmeia chun thafân i ta, Iengdingin am hmêlmak âng chu pawm i ta?"
For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths.,"Mihriem lampuihai chu LALPA mithai hmaah a um sih a, Ama chun a lampuihai po po chu a siemruol hlak."
"His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.","Mi khawhlo chu ama khaw- hlona ngei chun lâng a ta, A suolna hruihai chun ama khit tlat nîng a tih."
He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.,Inchûktirna tlasamin thîng a ta; Ân vêtna nasat lei chun ama chu invâkhmang a tih.
"My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;","Ka naupa, i tuolbâwm ta dinga aiawtu i nih a, Hmêlmak mi ta dinga i kuthai i ben chun,"
"Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.",I baua thuhai ngei chun âwk i na; I baua thuhai ngei chun man i ni tah.
"Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;","Tuhin hi hi thaw la, ka naupa, nangma le nangma chu insansuok rawh, I tuolbâwm kuta chun i lût a ni ta sih a; Fe la, nang le nang chu insukhnuoi la, i tuolbâwm chu ngên rawh."
"Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;","I mithai chu inna inhmutir naw la, I mitkhohai chu ininnghiltir bawk naw rawh."
"Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.","Ramsuoktu kuta sakhi a suok angin le, Vate vêtua inthawka vate a suok ang elin, Nang le nangma chu insansuok rawh."
"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:","Nang thabo, phaivâng kuomah fe la, A lampuihai ngaituo la, var rawh."
"Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,","Chu chun lal a nei nawh a, Enkawltu amanih, rorêltu amani khawm a nei nawh."
"Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.","Nipui lai a bu a siekhâwl a, Busîk hunah a bu a lâk khâwm hlak."
"How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?","Aw thabo, ieng chen am i zâl ding a na? I zâlnaa inthawkin iengtik âm i tho ding a na?"
"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:","Zâl dep bêk, in dep bêk, Zâla kuthai hang thlep dep bêk."
"So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.","Chuongchun, inru angin i pasietna chu hung a ta, I tlâksamna chu mi râlthuoma inthuom angin hung a tih."
"A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;","Mi hmangna bo, mi khawhlo, Bau chapotakin a lêng a."
"That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;","A mithai a sêp a, a kehaiin thu a hril a, A kuthaiin inchiknahai ân chûktir a."
"In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.","A lungrila chun kâwmâwna a um a, thilsuol a rawt suok rawp a, Indarna a tu hlak."
"Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.","Chuleiin, a lungzîngna chu hung thut a ta, Thâwk le khatin kawidar a ta, dam nâwkna boin."
"There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:","Thil paruk LALPAIN a theidahai chu a um a, Anih, pasari, chuong chu ama ta dingin tirdakum an nih;"
"Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;","Mit mengsânghai, lei khêlhlip, Pawitâwklo thisen insuoktir hlak kuthai le chun,"
"A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,","Ngaituona suol ngairuot hlak lungril le, Pawi tâwk dinga ke tlân hrât hlakhai leh;"
"A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.","Hrietpuitu indiklo khêlthu sâksuok hlaktu, Unauhai laia indarna tu hlaktu le chun."
"My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:","Ka naupa, i pa thupêk hi kawl tlat la, I nu inchûktirna hi nghatsan bawk naw rawh."
Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck.,"I lungrila chun khuopde tlat zing la, I rîng vêla chun zem tlat rawh."
"When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.","I fe pha chun nang chu ṭhuoi a ti cheh a; I in pha chun nang chu vêng a ti cheh a; Chun, i hung meng pha khawm chun inbiekpui a ti che."
For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:,"Thupêk chu khâwnvar a na, inchûktirna chu var a ni sih a; Inchûktirna thununnahai chu hringna lampui a nih;"
"To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.","Nuhmei riloa inthawka hum ding chein le, Hmêlmak baua inpâk tehlêmnaa inthawka vêng ding chein."
Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.,"I lungrila chun a mawina chu châk naw la, A mitsîrhai chun nang chu kuoi bawk naw raw se che."
For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.,"Nuhmei hur lei hin pasal chu bei hlekah siem a ni hlak a nih, Chun, uirenu chun hringna hlu chu a pêlin a pêl hlak."
"Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?","Miin a kalakah a puonhai kâng loin, Mei a chepdê thei am a nih?"
"Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?","Annawleh, mi a ke kâng loin, Meiling chungah a lâwn thei am a nih?"
So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.,Mi a tuolbâwm nuhmei kuoma lût chu chuong ang bawk chu a na; Amanu va tâwk taphawt chu hrem naw ni naw nih.
"Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:",Inruin a phîngṭâm laiin ân sukkhawpna dinga ân rûk chun mihaiin an hmusit ngai nawh a.
"But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house.",Amiruokchu ama chu hmu suok a ni chun a lêt sariin thung a ta; A ina thuomhnaw po po chu pe vawng a tih.
He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.,"Nuhmei le uiretna thil thawtu chu lungril bo a na, Ama lungril ngei sukse dingin thil a thaw a nih."
Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.,"Inhliemna le hmaimâwkna hmûng a ta, A hmaimâwkna chu hrûk hmang ni naw nih."
For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.,"Itthîkna hi mihriem lungsenna a na, Phubalâk ni chun hla naw nih."
"He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.","Intlanna hrim hrim ngaisak naw nih a, Thilpêk tamtakhai chu pe la khawm, lungawi el chuong naw nih."
"My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.","Ka naupa, ka thu hi kawl la, Ka thupêkhai hi nangmaa chun siekhâwl rawh."
Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.,"Ka thupêkhai hi kawlin khawsa la, Ka închûktirna chu i mitnautê angin;"
Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.,"I kutpârhaia chun khuopde la, I lungril phêk chunga chun ziek rawh."
"Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding thy kinswoman:","Varna kuoma chun, “Nang chu ka farnu i nih,” ti la, Hrietthiemna chu i laibungah inbûk rawh."
"That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.","Hmêlmak nuhmeia inthawka an kawl theina ding chein, Hmêlmak a thuhaia zaihlêmtu chea inthawk chun."
For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;,"Ka in tukverah, Ka thirlêna chun ka en hlak sih a."
"And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,","Chuongchun, mi mâwlhai laia chun ka en a, Tleirâwlhai laia chun, Hrietthiemna bo tlangvâl ka hmuh a."
"Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,","Ama chun amanu tuol kawtthlêra chun fein, Amanu in lampui chu a hraw a,"
"In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.","Chu ni zântiengah, thimtham hnuoiah; Zân mâwk inthim mup hnuoia chun."
"And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.","Chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun nuhmei, Nawchizawr inthuoma inthuom, lungril inlêktak ân tuokpui a."
(She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:,"Amanu chu mi bautam ngalhrâttak a na, A ina hrim a ke chu a um hman ngai nawh a."
"Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.)","Kawtthlêra le khawlai dunghaia umin, Kil tina inchânin a nghâk zing a."
"So she caught him, and kissed him, And with an impudent face she said unto him:","Chuongchun, amanu chun ama chu a man a, a fâwp tah a, Chun, hmêl iniemtakin a kuomah a hril tah a;"
Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.,"“Inremna thilinhlânhai inthâwina inhlân ding ka nih a, Hi ni hin ka thutiemhai chu kân thien tah a."
"Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.","Chuleiin, nangma tuok ding chein ka hung suok a nih; Taimataka i hmêl zawng dingin, chuongchun, ka hmu suok ta che hi."
"I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.","Ka khum chu puon cheimawi inkhumin ka chei tah a, Puon ṭielhai Aiguptaa khâwng chun."
"I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.","Ka khum chu riminhnik ka theh a, Murra le, beraw le, thingzungthakin."
"Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.","Hung la, zingkâr chenin ei hmangaina sipzak lâng ei ta, Hmangainahaiin eini chu inhnêm ei tih,"
For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:,"Ka pasal chu inah a um nawh a, Khuol ram hlatakah a fe ta sih a."
He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.,"Ama chun tangka fûn a chawi a, Thla lir pha leh hung tlung a tih,” tiin."
With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.,Amanu thu hril ṭha chun ama chu ân pêktir tah a; A hmûrhai zaihlêmna chun ama chu a tirlui tah a.
"He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;","Ama chun amanu chu a zui nghâl a, Bâwngchal sathattu kuoma fe ang elin, Annawleh, invêt sukdikna dinga thîrkawl bun ang elin,"
"Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.","Thalin a thin chu a sunthleng hmakhata, Vatein châng a baw ang elin, A nun thlengna ding a nih ti hre loin."
"Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.","Chuleiin, tuhin ka nau- pasalhai, mi lo ngai unla, Ka baua thuhai hi pawisa ta u."
Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.,"A lampuihaia chun in lungril innghat naw sienla, A lampuihai chu zui bawk naw ro."
"For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.","Mi tamtak chu hliemin a peithlûk ta sih a; Anih, a sukhlumhai po po chu sipai râlhrâthai an nih."
"Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.","Amanu in chu Seol fena lampui a na, Thina pindana lûtthla chu."
"Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?","Varna chu a khêkin, Hrietthiemna chun a râwl ân suo a ni naw am a nih?"
"On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;","Lampui sîra hmun insânghaia chun, Lampui ṭhuom laihaia chun a ngîr a;"
"Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:","Khawpui lûtnaa, dâikawtkhâr sîrahai, Kawtkhâr lûtnaahai chun a khêk rak rak a;"
"Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men.","“In kuomah, aw mihriemhai, ka khêk a, Ka râwl chu mihriem naupahai kuomah kân suo a nih."
"O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.","Aw nang mi mâwl, varna hung hrethiem ta la, Chun, nangni invêthai, hriet- thiemna lungril hung nei ro."
"Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.","Ngai ta u, thil ṭha bîkhai ka hril ding a ni sih a, Ka hmûrhai kâkna chu thil indik a ni ding a nih."
For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.,"Ka bau chun thudik sâksuok a ta, Khawhlona chu ka hmûrhai ta dingin tirdakum a ni sih a."
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.,"Ka baua thu po pohai chu felna a na, Annia chun a kâwi amanih, a khêl amani khawm a um nawh."
"They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.","A hrethiemtu ta ding chun a fie vawng a, Hrietna hmu suoktuhai ta ding chun ân dik vawng bawk a nih."
"Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.","Tangka ni loin, ka inchûktirna hi lo pawm ro, Rangkachak ditumtak nêkin hrietna chu lo chang bawk unla."
For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.,Lunghluhai nêkin varna chu a ṭha lem sih a; Thil po po dit thei taphawthai chu ama le hrilkhi ding a um nawh.
"I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge and discretion.","Kei varna hin varna chu ka chêngnaah ka hmang a, Hrietna le ngairuotthiemna chu ka hmu suok a."
"The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.","LALPA ṭi chu suolna theidana ding a na, Chapona le, insuklienna le rîtlona kawng leh, Bau chapo hi ka theida a nih."
"Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.","Thurâwnna chu ka ta a na, hrietna hrisêl leh, Hrethiemin ka um a, thilthawtheina ka nei a nih."
"By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.","Lalhaiin keimain ro an rêl a, Lal nauhai chun keimain rorêl dik chu an sukthlûk bawk a."
"By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.","Rorêltuhai chun keimain ro an rêl a, Mi ṭhahai le, hnuoi chunga rorêltuhai po po chun."
I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.,"A mi hmangaituhai chu ka hmangai veh a, Chun, nguntaka a mi zawngtuhai chun mi hmu suok bawk an tih."
"Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable wealth and righteousness.","Hausakna le inzâkaina chu ka kuomah a um a, Hausaknahai le felna tlotak el chu."
"My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.","Ka ra chu rângkachak nêkin, anih, rângkachak inthieng nêkin a ṭha lem a, Ka pungna khawm chu tangka ditumtak nêkin a ṭha lem."
"I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;","Felna lampuia chun ka feh a, Rorêlna lampuitakhaia chun."
"That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.","Kei a mi hmangaituhai chu thil nei dinga ka siem theina ding le, An sum inhai chu ka suksip theina dingin."
"Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.","LALPA chun a lampui inṭanna angin a mi siem a, Inhmata a sinthawhai hmasatak angin."
"I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.","Atîra inthawk, chatuona indinin ka um a, Hnuoi hrim la um hmain."
"When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.","Tuipuihai a um naw laiin lâk suokin ka um a, Tuikhurhai tuia sipa umhai um naw lai chun."
"Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;","Tlânghai siemrêl an ni hmain, Muolhai hma daiin, lâk suok ka ni tah a;"
"While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.","Ramhai le hnuoi a la siem naw lai le, Khawvêl pilvut inṭan hma dai bawk chun."
"When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,","Vânhai chu a buotsai lai chun, chutaka chun ka um a, Tuipui chung inkuol a siem lai chun;"
"When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,","Vâna sûmhai a siem laiin, Tuipui tuikhurhai chu a sukdet lai chun."
"When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;","Chuong lai chun tuipui ta dingin tiemchin a pêk a, Tuihai chun a thupêk chu an bawsiet nawna dingin, Leihnuoi lungphûmhai chu a ruot lai chun:"
"Then I was by him, as a master workman; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him,","Chuong lai chun amaa chun sinthaw hotu ang ka lo ni tah a; Chun, ama hmaa chun hlima um rawpin, Ni tina a lâwmna chu ka lo ni tah a."
Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.,"A leihnuoi chêng theinaa chun hlima umin, Ka lâwmna chu mihriem nau- pahai chungah a ni tah a."
"Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.","Chuleiin, tuhin, ka naupa- salhai mi lo ngai unla, Ka lampui hrawtuhai chu mi hamṭha an ni sih a."
"Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.","Inchûktirna chu ngai unla, var unla, Dit naw hrim hrim naw ro."
"Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.","Ka thu hretu chu mi hamṭha a nih, Ka dâikawtkhâra ni tina nghâktu, Ka kawtkhâr bienga nghâk zingtu chu."
"For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.","Tukhawm a mi hmu suoktu chun hringna chu a hmu suok a, LALPA ditsakna chu chang a tih."
But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.,"Amiruokchu, ka chunga suksuol chun ama lungril ngei a sukkhawhlo a, Kei a mi theidatuhai po po chun thina an hmangai a nih.”"
Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:,"Varna chun a in chu a bâwl a, A lungban pasarihai chu a phun tah a."
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:,"A ranhai chu a that a, a uoin chu a chawkpawl tah a, A dawkân khawm chu a siemrêl ta bawk a."
She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:,"A nunghâkhai chu a tir suok a, Khawpui hmun insângtakhaia chun an khêk a,"
"Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,","“Tukhawm mi mâwl chu hi tieng hin hung raw se,” tiin. Hrietthiemna boa um ta ding chun, a kuomah a hril a,"
"Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.","“Hung la, ka bei hung fa la, Ka uoin chawkpawl chu hung dâwn rawh."
"Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.","Nang mi mâwl, mâwlna chu mâksanin khawsa la, Hrietthiemna lampui chu hung hraw rawh,” tiin."
He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.,Hmusittu siemṭhatu chun inzakna a hmu hlak a; Mi khawhlo kâwktu chun kut thlâkna a tuok hlak.
"Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.","Hmusittu chu kâwk naw rawh, chuong naw chun, theida rawi a ti che. Mi var chu kâwk la, ama chun hmangai a ti che."
"Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.","Mi var kuoma chun inchûktirna pe la, ama chu hung var nâwk sawt a ta, Mi fel chu inchûktir la, ama chu thiemnaa chun hung pung a tih."
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.,"LALPA ṭi chu varna bul a nih, Mi Inthieng hrietna chu hrietthiemna bul a ni bawk."
"For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.","Keimaa chun i nihai chu belsa nîng a ta, I dam sûng kumhai chu sukpung nîng an tih."
"If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.","I var chun, nangma ta dinga var i na, I hmusit chun, nangma ngeiin phur i tih."
"The foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knoweth nothing.","Nuhmei invêt chu a hmûr a thiem a, Ama chu a mâwl a, iengkhawm a hriet nawh."
"And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,","A in kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a, Khawpui hmun insânghaia ṭhungnaa chun,"
"To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:","Mi fe inlawnhai ko dingin, Chuong an lampuia fe peihai chu,"
"Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,","“Tukhawm mi mâwl chu, hi tieng hung raw se,” tiin. Hrietthiemna boa um ta ding chun a hril a:"
"Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.","“Tui inrûkhai chu a thlum a, Fienriela bei fâk chu ân hnik bawk a,” tiin."
But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.,"Amiruokchu, mithihai chu chutaka chun an um ti a hriet nawh a, Amanu mikhuolhai khawm chu Seol lipuia chun an um ti a hriet bawk nawh."
