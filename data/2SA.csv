"And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;","Chun, Saula a thi hnungin, David chu Amalek mihai rûnnaa inthawkin a hung a, David chu Ziklag khuoa ni hni a um hnung chun,"
"it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.","a ni thum ni chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat an ṭhanghmuna inthawk Saula kuoma mi chu a puonhai tlêr nengnungin le a lua pilvut kai nung hin a hung a; chun, David kuomah a hung tlung chun hnuoia bawkkhupin chibai a bûk a."
"And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.","David chun a kuomah, “Khaw laia inthawka hung am i nih a?” a ta; ama chun, “Israel mihai ṭhanghmuna inthawkin ka hung tlân suok a nih,” a ta."
"And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Ieng angin am thil a um a, mi hril ta khai?” a ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Indonaa inthawk chun mihai chu an tlânseh a, mi tamtak chu an tluh a, an thi tâwl a, chun, Saula le a naupa Jonathan khawm an thi ve a,” a ta."
"And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?","Chun, David chun a hriltu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Iengtin am Saula le a naupa Jonathan chu an thi ti i hriet a?” a ta."
"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.","A hriltu tlangvâl chun, “Iengtin tin amanih Gilboa tlânga chun ka lo um kher a; chun, ngai ta, Saula chu a fei ringsana ngîr ka hmuh a, chun, tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai chun an hung hnai ta hle el a."
"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.","Chun, a hnungtieng a hung ngha chun a mi hei hmuh a, a mi hei ko a. Chun, kei chun, ‘Hitaka hin ka um ie,’ tiin ka dawn a."
"And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.","Chuongchun, ka kuomah, ‘Tu am i nih a?’ tiin a mîn dawn a. Chun, kei chun, ‘Amalek mi ka nih,’ tiin ka dawn a."
"And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, ‘Ka kâwla hin ngîr la, mi hung that el ta, ka la dam ting a, lunginzîngnain a mi tlâkkhum ta sih a,’ a ta."
"So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.","Chuongchun, a kâwla chun ka ngîr a, chuonga tlu dêr ta hnung chu a dam zo ta âwm hrim hrima ka hriet naw leiin ka that ta el a, a lua lallukhum le bânbun chu ka lâk a, ka pu kuomah hitaka hin ka hung lâk a nih,” a ta."
"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:","Chuongchun, David chun ama silfênhai chu a chel a, a keithlêr tah a, chuong ang bawk chun a kuoma mi um po pohai chun an thaw veh a;"
"and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.","chuongchu, Saula le a naupa Jonathan le LALPA mihai le Israel sûnghai chun an sûn a, an ṭah a, zântieng chenin bu an nghei a, kâwlhnâma sukhlum an ni tâk leiin."
"And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.","Chun, David chun a hriltu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Khâwtieng mi am i nih a?” a ta. Ama chun, “Hmêl- mak mi, Amalek mi naupa ka nih,” a tih a, a dawn a."
"And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “LALPA hrieknâl sukbohmang dinga a chunga kutthlâk chu iengtiziea ṭi lo am i nih a?” a ta."
"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.","Chuongchun, David chun tlang- vâlhai laia mi pakhat chu a ko a, “Va hnai la, va that rawh,” a ta. Chun, a va sât a, a thi tah a."
"And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “I thisen chu nangma lu chung ngeiah um raw se, nangma bâu ngeiin, ‘LALPA hrieknâl chu ka that a nih,’ tiin a phuong si cheh a,” a ta."
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,"Chuongchun, David chun Saula le a naupa Jonathan chu hi ṭaphla hin a ṭah a,"
"(and he bade them teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):","chun, thal hla chu Juda thlahai inchûktir dingin a tir tâwl a, ngai ta, Jaser bua chun ziek a nih."
"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!","Aw Israel, i ropuina chu i bâwlhmunahai that a na, Mi thilthawtheihai an tlu ta hi!"
"Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.","Gath-a chun hril naw unla, Askelon kawtthlêrahai chun phuong bawk naw ro; Chuong naw chun Philistin naunuhai lâwm an ta, Sertan lo naunuhai hlimin khêk pal rawi an tih."
"Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.","Nangni Gilboa tlânghai, In chungah dâidâw le ruo khawm tla naw raw se; thil inhlân ding khawm insuo bawk naw ro. Chutaka chun mi thilthawthei phaw chu tirdakumtakin an pei sih a; Saula phaw, hrieknâl lo mi phaw ang elin."
"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.","Thathai thisena inthawk le, mi thilthawthei thâua inthawk chun, Jonathan thal chu a lêt nawh a; Saula kâwlhnâm chu a thlâwnin a lêt bawk nawh."
"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.","Saula le Jonathan umdân chu dit a umin a mâwi a, An thi khawma an inṭhe nawh; Mupuihai nêkin an ṭuonrang lem a, Sakeibakneihai nêkin an hrât lem."
"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.","Nangni Israel naunuhai, Saula chu ṭa ro, Puon sen mawihaia inthuom cheu a, In puonahai rângkachaka cheimawinahai belpêktu cheu chu."
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.,Indo lai taka mi thilthawtheihai an tlûk el chu! I bâwlhmunahai Jonathan chu an that tah.
"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.","Ka unaupa Jonathan, i chungthua hin ka lunginzîng a nih; Ka chungah i ṭha êm êm hlak a, I mi hmangaina chu a mak a, Nuhmei hmangaina chu a khûm dai a nih."
"How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!","Mi thilthawtheihai chu an tluh a, Indona thuomhnawhai khawm a bohmang zo tah!"
"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, chuong hnunga chun Ammon thlahai lal chu a thih a, a naupa Hanun chu a aiawin ân lal a."
"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.","David chun, “A pa chun a mi lo lunginsiet angin kei khawma Nahas naupa Hanun chu lunginsiet vêng ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chun a pa chungchâng thua thlamuon dingin ama mihai a tir a. Chun, David mihai chun Ammon thlahai ram chu an va tlung a."
"But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?","Nisienlakhawm, Ammon thlahai lusahairawi chun an lal Hanun kuoma chun, “David hin i pa ân za leiin i kuoma hin thlamuontu a hung tir niin i ring am a ni? David hin khawpui a hne theina dingin a siehlawhai khawpuia hin enthlatu le enfietu dingin a hung tir a ni lem naw am a nih?” an ta."
"So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.","Chuongchun, Hanun chun David mihai chu a man a, an khâkhmul chenve a vâwpêk a; chun, an silfênhai chu a laitakah an mawng tlung chau- in a tanpêk bawk a, ân fetir tah a."
"When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.","Chun, David chu an hang hril chun, a tuok dingin mi a tir a, anni chu an inzak hle el sih a. Chun, lal chun, “In khâkhmulhai a mâwng sei hma po chu Jerikoah um hri unla, chu hnunga chun hung de ti niu,” a ta."
"And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chun David theida zâwng an lo ni tah ti an hung inhriet chun Ammon thlahai chun Beth-rehoba mi Suria mihai le Zobaa mi Suria mihai, sipai sîng hni le, lal Maaka mi sîng khat leh, Topa mihai sîng khat le sâng hni leh an inchah a, an ruoi a."
"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.","Chun, David chun chu chu a hrietin Joab le sipai huoisenhai po po a tir a."
"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chu an hung suok a, khaw lûtna kawtkhâr tienga chun ṭhanghmun an siem a; chun, Zoba mihai le Rehoba mihai Suria mihai le Toba le Maaka mihai ruok chu a tumin phûlah an um a."
"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:","Chuongchun, an hma tieng le an hnungtieng an hung thaw ding a ni ti Joabin a hriet chun Israel mihai laia a ṭha ṭha a thlangsuok a, Suria mihai chu do dingin ṭhanghmun a lo khawh a."
and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.,"Chun, mi dang po po chu a unaupa Abisai kutah a sie vawng a, Ammon thlahai chu thaw dingin ṭhanghmun a khaw bawk a."
"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.","“Suria mihai hi ka hne naw ding chun nangin mi ṭhangpui i ta, chun, nangin Ammon thlahai hi i hne naw ding chun hung ṭhangpui ka ti che."
"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.","Huoitakin um unla, ei mihai le ei Pathien khuohai sanin insuk pasal ei tiu; chun, LALPA chun ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw raw se,” a ta."
So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.,"Chuongchun, Joab le a kuoma mihai chun Suria mihai chu do dingin indona hmun tieng chu an va hnai a; chun, a hmaa chun an tlânsieh a."
"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chun Suria mihai an tlânsie ti an hriet chun anni khawm chu Abisai hmaa chun an tlânse ve tah a; khuoa chun an lût a. Chun, Joab chun Ammon thlahai chu a kîrsan a, Jerusalemah a fe tah a."
"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.","Chun, Suria mihaiin Israelhai hmaa chun an chan a hung chau tah ti an hriet chun an inpun khâwm a."
"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.","Chun, Hadadezer chun mi a tir a, Vadung khêla Suria mihai chu a ṭhuoi suok a, Hadadezer sipai hotu Sobak chun hma a ṭhuoi a; Helamah an hung a."
"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.","Chun, chu chu David an hril a; chun, ama chun Israel mi po po a ko khâwm a, Jordan vadung an kai a, Helama chun an feh a. Chun, Suria mihai chun David chu do dingin ṭhanghmun an lo siem a, an lo thawh a."
"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.","Chun, Suria mihai chu Israel- hai hmaa chun an tlânse tah a; chun, David chun Suria mi tawlailîr za sari chunga chuong le sakawr chung chuong mi sîng li a that a; chun, an sipai hotu Sobak khawm a that a, chutaka chun a thi tah a."
"And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.","Chuongchun, Hadadezer hnuoia lal siehlawa umhai po po chun Israel- hai hmaah an chan a chau tah ti an lo hriet chun, Israelhai leh inremna an siem a, an siehlawhaiah an um tah a. Chuongchun, Suria mihai chun Ammon thlahai chu an ṭhangpui ngam nâwk ta nawh a."
"And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.","Chun, kum dâm a hung invawi a, lalhai indo dinga an suok hlak lai chun, Davidin Joab chu a tir a, a mihai le Israel mihai po po leh; chun, Ammon thlahai chu an suk- bohmang a, Rabba khuo an inhuol a, David ruok chu Jerusalemah a um a."
"And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.","Chun, zântieng nisa innêma chun hieng hi a hung na, David chu a khuma inthawk chun a tho a, lal in inchunga chun a hang lêng a; chun, inchunga inthawk chun nuhmei pakhat insil lai hi a hei hmuh a, chu nuhmei chu hmêl ṭhatak a nih."
"And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?","Chun, David chun mi a tir a, chu nuhmei chanchin chu ân dawn feltir a. Chun, mi pakhatin, “Eliam naunu, Bathseba, Hit mi Uria nuhmei a ni naw am a nih?” a tih a."
"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house.","Chun, David chun mi a tir a, an va ṭhuoi tah a; chun, a kuoma a va tlung chun a lo zâlpui tah a; (a felnaw zo insukthieng laitak a na) chun, a in tieng a fe nâwk tah a."
"And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chu a hung inrai tah a, chun, “Nau ka vawn a ni tah,” tiin David chu mi ân hriltir a."
"And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.","Chun, David chun Joab kuomah, “Hit mi Uria chu ka kuomah inhung- tir rawh,” tiin ân chah a. Chun, Joab chun Uria chu David kuomah ân fetir a."
"And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.","Chun, Uriain a kuom a hang tlung chun, Joab le mihai chu ieng am an chang a, indonahai ieng am an chang ti ân dawn a."
"And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king.","Chun, David chun Uria kuomah, “I in tieng fe la, i kehai zu sâwp rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, Uria chu lal ina inthawk chun a suok a, chun, lal chun fâk dinghai leh a hnawtzui a."
"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.","Nisienlakhawm, Uria chu a lalpa siehlawhai lai lal in kawtkhâr bula chun a zâl ve ta el a, a in tieng chun a fe ta nawh a."
"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?","Chun, David chu, “Uria chu a in tieng a fe nawh,” ti an hril phingleh David chun Uria kuoma chun, “Inzin hung i nih a ni naw am a nih? Ieng- dinga i in tieng i fe naw am?” a ta."
"And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.","Uria chun David kuomah, “Pathien bâwm le Israelhai le Juda- hai chu bûkah an um a, chun, ka pu Joab le ka pu mihai chu ramhnuoiah an inkul bawk a; kei ka ina fein fain dâwnin, ka nuhmei kuomah ka zâl bîk ding maw? I hringna le i thlarau hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, chu chu thaw naw tawp ka tih,” a ta."
"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.","Chun, David chun Uria kuom- ah, “Vawisûn chu hitaka hin um la, zîngah fe de ti nih,” a ta. Chuong- chun, Uria chu Jerusalema chun chu ni le a zînga khawm chun a um tah a."
"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.","Chun, David chun a ko a, a hmaa chun a fâkin a dâwn a, a sukrui ta dêr a; chun, zântieng chun a in tienga fe loin a pu siehlawhai laia zâl ding chun a suok a."
"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.","Chun, a zîngah zîngkâr chun David chun Joab chu lekha a thawn a, Uria chu ân chawitir a."
"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.","Chun, lekhaa chun, “Uria chu râl zuolna laitaka inhmatâwngtir unla, an thata a thi hlauna dingin thlathlam ro,” tiin a ziek a."
"And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were.","Chun, Joab chun khuo chu ân huol vêl lai chun mi huoi huoi umna nia a hrieta chun Uria chu ân ṭhang- tir a."
"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.","Chun, khuoa mihai chu an hung suok a, Joab chu an hung thawh a, mi ṭhenkhat David mihai laia mi ngei khawm chu an thih a; chun, Hit mi Uria khawm chu a thih a."
Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;,"Chuongchun, Joab chun mi a tir a, indona chungchâng thu tieng po po chu David chu a hril a;"
"and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,","chun, a mi tir kuoma chun, “Lal kuoma indona chanchin po po i hril zo hnungin,"
"it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?","a lung a sen thuta, ‘Iengdinga thaw dinga khaw bul ela in fe am a na? Kula inthawkin kâp el an ti cheu ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
"who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.","Jerubbeseth naupa Abimelek kha tuin am a that a? Bu râwtnawina lung chunghnung lem nuhmeiin kula inthawkin a chungah a zuk thlâk a, Thebez-a khan a thi a ni naw am a nih? Iengdinga chuong kul bul ela fe am in ni a?’ a ti chun, ‘I siehlaw Uria Hit mi khawm kha a thi annaw,’ ti rawh aw,” tiin a hril a."
"So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.","Chuongchun, a mi tir chu a feh a, a va tlung a, Joabin a tirna san po po chu David chu a hril tah a."
"And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate.","Chun, a mi tir chun David kuoma chun, “Mihai chun an mi hung nawr a, phûlah an mi hung thawh a; keini chun an khaw lûtna kawtkhâr tlung rakin kan nawr ve thung a."
"And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.","Chun, kâptuhai chun kula inthawk chun i siehlawhai chu an kâp a, chuongchun, lal siehlaw ṭhenkhat- hai chu an thih a; chun, i siehlaw Hit mi Uria khawm kha a thi annaw,” a ta."
"Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.","David chun a mi tir kuoma chun, “Joab kuoma chun hieng ang hin va hril rawh, ‘Hieng hin i lungril chu suklâwm naw chuong naw raw se, kâwlhnâm chun tu tu khawm a thlierbîk si nawh a, nasa nâwkzuolin khuo chu thaw unla, sukse ro,’ tiin infui rawh,” a ta."
"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.","Chun, Uria nuhmei chun a pasal Uria a thi ti a hriet chun a pasal chu a sûn a."
"And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.","Chun, a sûn hunbi a bo hnung chun David chun ama in tieng ân ṭhuoitir a, a nuhmeiah a nei tah a, naupasal a neipêk a. Nisienlakhawm, David thilthaw chun LALPA a suklungni nawh a."
"And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.","Chun, LALPA chun David kuoma chun Nathan a tir a. A kuoma chun a feh a, “Khaw pakhata hin mi pahni an um a, pakhat chu mi hausa a na, pakhat chu mi pasie a nih."
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;,Mi hausa chun berâm ruol tamtak le ran ruol tamtak a nei a;
"but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.","mi pasie ruok khan chu berâmte alâ chiterek pakhat ân châwk, a ivai pakhat bak naw chu iengkhawm a nei nawh a, a kuoma a nauhai le khawsa an na, a thlêng awtpui le a no in- ṭâwmpui, a ângsûnga um, a naunu- hmei ang chiea a ngai a nih."
"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.","Chun, mi hausa kuoma chun inzin pakhat hi a va tlung a; chun, a kuoma mikhuol hung tlung chu ama berâm le ran chu that phal loin, mi pasie berâm chu a lâkpêk a, a kuoma hung inzinpa chu a thatpêk a,” a ta."
"And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:","Chuongchun, David chu chu mi chunga chun a lunginsen ta hle el a; Nathan kuoma chun, “LALPA hring- na sâlin ka hril hi, chu thil thawtu chu sukhlum el tlâk a ni chu,"
"and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.","chun, hieng ang thil a thaw lei le lunginsietna a nei naw leiin a berâmte chu a lêt liin a thung ding nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;","Chuongchun, Nathan chun David kuomah, “Chu mi chu nang hi i nih, LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, Israelhai lal ni dingin hriek ka nâl cheh a, Saula kuta inthawkin ka sansuok cheh a;"
"and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.","chun, i pu in ro chu kân hluotir cheh a, i pu nuhmeihai chu i ângsûng- ah ka sieh a, Israel le Juda sûngkuohai ka pêk bawk cheh a, chun, chuong chu tlâwm taluo a ni chun, thil dang khawm ka pêk belsa ding che annâwm."
"Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.","Iengtiziea LALPA thu chu ngainêpa, a mithmua thil ṭha naw i thaw el am a ni leh? Hit mi Uria chu kâwlhnâmin i sukhlum a, a nuhmei chu i nuhmei dingin i neipêk a, Ammon thlahai kâwlhnâmin i that a."
"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.","Chuleiin, tu hin kâwlhnâm chun i insûng chu inkiensan naw tawp a tih, nang chun mi ngainêpin Hit mi Uria nuhmei chu i nuhmei dingin i lâkpêk ta sih a."
"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Ngai ta, nangma sûngkuo laia inthawk ngeiin i chungah thil ṭha naw insuoktir ka ta, i mithmu ngeiah i nuhmeihai chu lâkpêk ka ti cheh a, i vênghai pêng ka ta, sûn khawvarah i nuhmeihai chu zâlpui an tih."
"For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.","Nang chun chu inrûkin i thawh a, kei ruok chun chu Israel mihai po po mithmuah sûn khawvarah ka thaw ding a nih,’ a tih,” a ta."
"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.","Chun, David chun Nathan kuomah, “LALPA chungah thil ka lo suksuol tah a nih,” a ta. Chun, Nathan chun David kuomah, “LALPA khawma i suol chu a sie hmang ve tah a; thi naw ti nih."
"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.","Amiruokchu, hi i thilthaw hin Pathien hrilsietna remchângtak LALPA hmêlmahai ta dinga i siem leiin naupang nangmaa inthawka pieng chu thi ngei a tih,” a ta."
"And Nathan departed unto his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.","Chuongchun, Nathan chun a in tieng a fe san tah a. Chun, Uria nuhmei David a neipêk naupang chunga chun LALPA chun a kut a thlâk a, a na ta hle el a."
"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.","David chun naupang ta ding chun Pathien kuomah a ngên rak a; chun, David chun bu dâm a nghei a, a lût a, zân khawvârin hnuoiah a zâl tah a."
"And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.","Chun, a sûnghai laia upahai chu an tho a, hnuoia inthawka keitho ding chun a kâwlah an ngîr a; nisien- lakhawm, a tho nuom nawh a, an kuoma khawm bu khawm a fâk bawk nawh."
"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, ni sari ni chun naupang chu a thi tah a. Chun, David siehlawhai chun naupang chu a thi tah ti hril chu an ṭih a, “Ngai ta u, naupang a dam lai khan a kuomah thu ei hril a, ei râwl a ngai si nawh a, naupang chu a thi tah ti iengtin am hril ngam tâng ei ti leh, ieng amanih inlaw el rawi a tih,” an ta."
"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.","Nisienlakhawm, David chun chuonga siehlawhai chu an inbiekrûk a hmu chun David chun naupang chu a thi a nih ti a hriet tah a; chun, David chun a siehlawhai kuomah, “Nau- pang chu a thi tah a ni maw?” a ta. Chun, anni chun, “A thi tah,” an ta."
"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.","Chuongchun, David chu hnuoia inthawk chu a tho a, ân sâwp a, sahriek ân nâl a, a puonhai ân thleng a; chun, LALPA inah a feh a; Pathien chibai a bûk a; chun, a in tieng chun a fe nâwk a; chun, bu a hei lam a, a hmaa chun an hung sieh a, a fâk tah a."
"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.","Chun, a siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “I thil thawzie hi iengtizie am a ni a? Naupang chu a dam lai khan bu dâm i nghei a, i ṭap a; nisien- lakhawm, naupang chu a thi tah a, i tho a, bu dâm i fâk ta lem a,” an ta."
"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?","Chun, ama chun, “Naupang kha a la dam lai khan bu dâm ka ngheiin ka ṭap luoh a, ‘Naupang chu a dam theina dingin LALPA chun a mi lung- insiet rawi mawh, tuin am hrieng ei ta?’ ka ti a na."
"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu a thi ta sih a, iengdingin am bu nghei tâng ka ta? Ka ko kîr nâwk thei ding am a nih?

"And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;","Chuongchun, David chun a nuhmei Bathseba chu a thlamuon a, a kuomah a lût a, a zâlpui a, chun, naupasal a nei a, a hminga chun Solomon a sak a. Chun, ama chu LALPAIN a hmangai a;"
"and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah’s sake.","chun, zâwlnei Nathan chu thu ân chawitir a; chun, ama chun LALPA hming chawiin a hminga chun Jedi- dia a sak a."
"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.","Chun, Joab chun Ammon thla- hai khawpui Rabba a rûn a, khawpui chu a lâk a."
"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.","Chun, Joab chun David kuomah mi a tir a, “Rabba chu ka rûn a; anih, tuihai khawpui chu ka lâk tah an- naw."
"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.","Chuongchun, mi la umhai po po chu ko khâwm la, khawpui chu do tumin ep la, la rawh, keiin khawpui chu ka lâk chun chu ka hming put el rawi a tih,” a ta."
"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.","Chuongchun, David chun mi po pohai chu a ko khâwm a, Rabbaa chun an feh a, an va rûn a, an lâk tah a."
"And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.","Chun, an lal lallukhum khum lai chu a lâkpêk a, a rikzie chu rângkachak talent bûk a na, lung- hluhai khawm a ṭhang a; chun, David chu an inkhumtir a. Chun, khawpuia inthawk chun râllâk sum tamtak a lâk a."
"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.","Chun, mipuihai chu a kei suok a, thingâtnahai dâm, hnuoi inletna thîrzumhai dâm, thîr hreipuihai dâm hmangin sin an inthawtir a; hnuoi rawchang dâm an insiemtir a.

"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.","Chun, David naupa Absalom chun farnu hmêl ṭhatak a nei a, a hming chu Tamar a nih. Chun, David naupa Amnon chun ama chu a hmangai a."
And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her.,"Chuongchun, Amnon chu a farnu Tamar lei chun a buoi ta hle el a, a damnaw tah a; ama hlak chu nu- nghâk inthieng a ni sih a; a chunga thil ieng amani hang thaw chu Amnon ta ding chun khirtak a nih."
"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.","Amiruokchu, Amnon chun ruol a nei a, a hming chu Jonadab a na, David unaupa Simea naupa a nih; Jonadab chu mi var vervêktak a nih."
"And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.","Chun, a kuomah, “Aw, nang lal naupa hi a ni têla iengtiziea chêr tel tel am i nih a? I mi hril nuom naw ding am a nih?” a ta. Chun, Amnonin a kuomah, “Ka unaupa Absalom farnu Tamar hi ka hmangai tlat el a nih,” a ta."
"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.","Chun, Jonadab chun a kuomah, “I khumah zâl zing la, damnaw tehlêm thaw la, chun, i pain a hung en pha che a kuomah, ‘Ka hni che a nih, ka farnu Tamar kha ka kuomah hung sienla, bei fâk ding mi hung pe sienla; chun, ka hmu theiah, ka mit- hmu ngeiah fâk ding mi buotsaipêk raw se; a kuta inthawk ngeiin lo fâng ka tih,’ lo ti raw khai,” a ta."
"So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.","Chuongchun, Amnon chu a zâl a, a damnaw tehlêm tah a; chun, lalin a va en chun Amnon chun lal kuomah, “Ka hni che a nih, ka farnu Tamar kha hung sienla, ka mithmu ngeia hin beiphêk pahni mi siempêk sienla, ama kuta inthawk ngei chun lo fâng ka tih,” a ta."
"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.","Chuongchun, David chun Tamar kuoma chun, “I ṭapa Amnon in tieng fe la, fâk ding va siempêk raw khai,” tiin a inah mi a tir a."
"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.","Chuongchun, Tamar chu a ṭapa Amnon in tieng chun a feh a; ama chu a lo zâl zing a. Chun, beihlawm chu a lâk a, a hmet a, a mithmuah beiphêk chu a siem a, beiphêkhai chu a em tah a."
"And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.","Chun, a emna chu a lâk a, a hmaa chun a bun a; nisienlakhawm, a fâk nuom nawh a. Chun, Amnon chun, “Mi po pohai hin mi suoksan vawng raw hai se,” a ta. Chuongchun, ama chu an suoksan ta vawng a."
"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.","Chun, Amnon chun Tamar kuoma chun, “I kuta inthawk ngeia ka fâk theina dingin fâk ding chu pindana hin hung la ta raw le,” a ta. Chun, Tamar chun a beiphêk siemhai chu a lâk a, a ṭapa Amnon kuomah pindana chun a lâk lût a."
"And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.","Infâktir dinga a kâwl hnaia a va fe chun a lo man a, a kuomah, “Ka farnu, hung ta zâl ei tih,” a ta."
"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.","Ama chun a dawn a, “Ni lo ve, ka ṭapa, mi thawlui naw rawh, Israelhai lai hin hieng ang thil hi thaw ding a ni nawh ie, hi thil suol invêtthlâktak hi thaw naw raw khai."
"And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.","Chun, keiin ka muolphona chu khâwlai am fepui ka ta? Chun, nang khawm Israelhai lai hin mi invêta ngai i ni el ding i sawnnaw. Chuleiin, lal be lem raw khai, i mi nei chu sêl chuong naw nih,” a ta."
"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.","Nisienlakhawm, a râwl chu a ngai nawh a, ama nêkin a hrât lem sih a, a thawlui a, a zâlpui tah a."
"Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.","Chuongchun, Amnon chun theida namênin a theida nâwk ta si nawh a, a theidana chu ama a hma- ngai laia a hmangaina nêka nasa lemin a nih a theida chu. Chuong- chun, Amnon chun a kuomah, “Tho la, fe hmang dai rawh,” a ta."
"And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Chuong ang ding chu a ni nawh, hienga indiknawtaka i mi tirhmang hi ka chunga i thil thaw ta nêk hman khan a ṭha naw lem a nih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a ngai chuong nawh a."
"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.","Chuongchun, a rawngbâwltu a siehlaw chu a ko a, “Hi nuhmei hi ka kuoma inthawkin insuoktir la, kawt kal tlat rawh,” a tih a."
"And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.","Zakawfuol ze tum tuma ṭiel a hâk a, chuong ang zakawfuol chu lal nunghâk inthienghai chun an hâk hlak a. Chuongchun, a siehlaw chun a ṭhuoi suok a, kawt a kal ta tlat a."
"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.","Chun, Tamar chun a lua chun vut a phul a, zakawfuol ze tum tuma ṭiel a hâk chu a keithlêr a, a lusîpah a kut a sui a, inringtaka ṭap malam peiin a fe tah a."
"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.","Chun, a ṭapa Absalom chun a kuomah, “I ṭapa Amnon chu i kuomah a hung lût a ni maw? nisienlakhawm, to el rawh, ka farnu, ama chu i ṭapa a ni annâwm, engto nuom naw rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, Tamar chu a ṭapa Absalom ina chun ngûitakin ân khum ta tlat el a."
"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.","Nisienlakhawm, lal Davidin chuong thil po po a hung hriet chun a lunginsen hle el tah a."
"And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.","Chun, Absalom chun Amnon kuoma chun a sie a ṭha, iengkhawm a hril nuom nawh a; Absalom chun a farnu Tamar chu a lo thawlui lei chun Amnon chu a theida hle a nih."
"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.","Chun, kum hni pumhlûm a bo hnung chun Ephraim kâwla Baal- hazora chun Absalom chun berâm hmul ân vâwtir a; Absalom chun lal naupahai po po chu a fiel a."
"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.","Chun, Absalom chu lal kuoma chun a feh a, “Ngai ta, i siehlaw chun berâm hmul ân vâwtir a, lal le a siehlawhai chu a siehlaw kuoma hin fe ve hai sienla,” a ta."
"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.","Chun, lal chun Absalom kuomah, “Ni lo e, ka naupa, kan rêng chun fe naw ning ung, sukkhaw taluo rawi kan ti che,” a ta. Ama chun a fiel a fiel a, amiruokchu, a fe nuom chuong nawh a, mal ruok chu a sâwm a."
"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?","Chuongchun, Absalom chun, “Annawleh, ka hni che hi, ka unaupa Amnon bêk kan kuomah hung raw se,” a ta. Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Iengdingin am fe bîk a ta?” a ta."
"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.","Nisienlakhawm, Absalom chun Amnon le lal naupahai chu an rênga a kuoma fe ve dingin a ngênpêk ṭâl a."
"And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.","Chun, Absalom chun a sie- hlawhai chu, “Ngai ta, Amnon chu uoin dâwna a hlim laiin in kuomah, ‘Amnon kha that ro,’ ka ti cheu chun that unla, ṭi naw ro, thu ka pêk ta cheu annâwm; insukhuoi unla, insukpasal ṭha unla,” tiin thu a pêk a."
"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.","Chuongchun, Absalom siehlaw- hai chun Amnon chunga Absalom thupêk ang chun an thawh a.

"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.","Chun, lampui kâra an la um laiin, “Absalomin lal naupahai po po a that ta vawng el a, pakhat khawm hla a nei nawh,” tiin David kuoma chun chanchin a hung tlung a."
"Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.","Chuongchun, lal chu a tho a, a silfênhai a keithlêr a, hnuoiah a zâl tah a; chun, a siehlawhai po po chu an silfênhai keithlêrin a kâwla chun an ngîr a."
"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.","Chun, David unaupa Simea naupa Jonadab chun a dawn a, “Ka pu hin lal naupasal tlangvâlhai po po chu an that vawng ti ring naw raw se, Amnon chau a thi a nih; a farnu Tamar a thawlui chena khan Absalom chun hieng anga thaw hi a tum hrim a nih."
"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.","Chuleiin, ka pu lal chun lal naupahai po po an thi amanih ti ringin, lung inhângpui naw raw se, Amnon chau a thi a nih,” a ta."
"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.","Absalom ruok chu a tlânhmang tah a.

"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.","Chun, Jonadab chun lal kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, lal naupahai chu an hung ie, i siehlawin a hril ang chie kha a ni ngei el,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.","Chun, a hril zo phingle chun, ngai ta, lal naupahai chu an hung tlung a, an râwl insuo meuin an ṭap a; chun, lal khawm chu a siehlawhai le chun an ṭap ta rak rak el a."
"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.","Absalom ruok chu a tlânhmang a; Gesur lal Ammihur naupa Talmai kuomah a feh a. Chun, David chun ni tin hin a naupa chu a sûn hlak."
"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.","Chuongchun, Absalom chu a tlânhmang a, Gesur rama chun a feh a, chutaka chun kum thum a va um a."
"And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.","Lal David chun Absalom kuoma fe chu ân hâwk êm êm a. Amnon chungchâng thua chun a thlamuong tah a, ama chu a thi ta sih a."
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.,Zeruia naupa Joab chun lal lungril chu Absalom chungah ân nghat ti a hriet a.
"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:","Chuongchun, Joab chun Tekoa khuoah mi a tir a, chutaka nuhmei var pakhat chu a vân ṭhuoitir a, a kuomah, “Lusûn angin insiem la, lusûnna puon sil la, sahriek khawm innâl loin, nuhmei sâwttak mithi sûn ta angin um rawh;"

"And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.","Chun, Tekoa khuoa nuhmei chun lal kuoma thu hril ding chun hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a, a bawkkhup a, “Aw lalpa, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” a ta."

"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.","Chun, i suoknu hin naupasal pahni ka nei a, an pahni chun loah an insuol a, tukhawm a ṭheltu ding an um si nawh a, a pakhat chun pakhat dang chu a vuok a, a sukhlum tah a."
"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.","Chun, ngai ta, an sûngkuo po po chun i suoknu hi an do hrawn a, ‘A unaupa thattu chu, a unaupa a that leia kan that ve theina dingin mi pe raw khai, chuongchun, rohluotu ding khawm sukbohmang nghâl kan tih,’ an ta; chuongchun, ka meiling la um sun chu sukhlum an ta, ka pasal chu hnuoi chunga hming le thla hrim hrim nei loin a um el ding a nih,” a ta."

"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.","Chun, Tekoa khuoa nuhmei chun lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, ka pu, bawsietna maw chu keia chunga le ka pa sûnghai chungah tla el raw se; chun, lal le lalṭhungpha chun maw chu phur naw raw se,” a ta."

"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.

"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.","Ama chun, “Hril ta la,” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun, “Annawleh, ieng leia Pathien mihai dodâla hienga thaw i tum am a nih a? Hieng thua inthawk hin lal chu thiemnaw chang angin ân lang a nih, lal chun a mi tlân hmang chu a ṭhuoikîr nâwk si naw lei hin."
"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.","Ei thi ngei ngei ding a na; chun, tuisik hnuoia inbaw tahnung rût nâwk thei ta lo ang hi ei na. Pathienin hringna hi a lâk hmang a ni nawh a, a tlân hmang chu amaa inthawka mi hran a ni nawna dingin rem a ruot a ni lem a nih."
"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.","Chuongchun, lalpa, ka pu kuoma hi thu hril dinga ka hung khawm hi mi ka ṭi lei a na, chun, i suoknu chun lal kuoma hin hril phawt ka ta, lal chun a suoknu hnina chu ân hlawtlingtir rawi mawh."
"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.",Lal chun kei le ka naupa hi Pathien ro hluo lo dinga mi sukbo- hmang tumtu kuta inthawkin i suok- nu hi sansuok dingin lo ngaisak i tih ka tih a.
"Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.","Chuongchun, i suoknu ta ding hin, lalpa, ka pu thu chu lung- muongumtak ni sienla, ka hni che a nih, a sie a ṭha lo thlier dingin lalpa ka pu chu Pathien vântirko ang el a ni sih a; chun, LALPA Pathien chu i kuomah um raw se, ka ti a nih,” a ta."
"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, nu- hmei kuoma chun, “Ka îndawn taphawt che chu ka kuomah ieng- khawm ip naw rawh aw,” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun, “Lalpa ka pu chun hril raw se chu,” a ta."
"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;","Chun, lal chun, “Hieng thua hrim hin Joab hin ṭhangna a nei am?” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun a dawn a, “Lalpa ka pu, i thlarau hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, lalpa ka pu hin a hril taphawt chu tukhawma vawitienga manih, changtienga manih an fe khêl thei âwm nawh a, i siehlaw Joab chun a mi tir a, hieng thuhai po po hi i suoknu hi a hril vawng a nih;"
"to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.","thil umdân sukdanglam dingin i siehlaw Joab chun hieng thil hi a thaw a nih; chun, ka pu chu khawvêla thil um po pohai hre theiin Pathien vântirko ang elin a var a nih,” a ta."
"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.","Chun, lal chun Joab kuomah, “Ngai ta, tuhin hi thil hi ka thaw ve tah a, chuleiin, tuhin fe la, tlangvâl Absalom chu va ṭhuoi nâwk raw le,” a ta."
"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king; and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.","Chun, Joab chu hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, chibai a bûk a, lal chun mal a sâwm a; chun, Joab chun, “Aw lalpa, ka pu chun a siehlaw hnina chu ân hlawtlingtir leiin vawisûn hin i siehlaw hin i mit ka tlung a nih ti ka lo hriet tah a,” a ta."
"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Joab chu a tho a, Gesura chun a feh a, Absalom chu Jerusalema chun a hung ṭhuoi tah a."
"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.","Chun, lal chun, “Ama in tieng fe sienla, ka hmêl chu hung hmu naw raw se,” a ta. Chuongchun, Absalom chu ama in tieng chun a feh a, lal hmêl chu a hmu ta nawh a."
Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.,"Tuhin Israelhai po po lai Absalom ang hrima hmêl ṭhata inpâk kai tukhawm an um nawh a, a ke lêra inthawka a lusîp chenin sawisêlna hrim hrim a um nawh a."
"And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.","A lu a vâw chun (kum khat peiah a vâw hlak a, a sam chu a rik êm leiin a vâw hlak a nih) a sam chu a bûk hlak a, lal bûk dâna shekel za hni a tling hlak a nih."
"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.","Chun, Absalom chun naupasal pathum le naunuhmei pakhat a nei a, a hming chu Tamar a na, hmêl ṭhatak a nih."
And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king’s face.,"Chuongchun, Absalom chu kum hni pumhlûm Jerusalemah a um a, nisienlakhawm, lal hmêl hrim hrim chu a hmu nawh a."
"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.","Chuongchun, Absalom chun lal kuoma tir dingin Joab chu ân chah a; nisienlakhawm, a fe nuom nawh a; chun, ân châ nawn nâwk a, nisien- lakhawm, a fe nuom chuong nawh a."
"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.","Chuongchun, a siehlawhai kuomah, “I aw, Joab lo chu ka lo kâwl a na, buṭei a nei a, va rawpêk vawng ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, Absalom sie- hlawhai chun lo chu an va raw tah a."
"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?","Chuongchun, Joab chu a tho a, Absalom kuomah a ina chun a feh a, a kuomah, “Iengdinga i siehlawhaiin ka lo an raw am?” a ta."
"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.","Absalom chun Joab chu a dawn a, “Ngai ta, ‘Iengdinga Gesura in- thawka hung am ka nih a? Chutaka chun um zing lang ka ta dingin a ṭha lem ding bah,’ tia lal kuoma tir dingin kân cha cheh a, chuleiin, lal hmêl chu mîn hmutir raw khai, chun, bawsiet- na nei ka lo ni chun mi sukhlum el raw se,” a ta."
"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.","Chuongchun, Joab chu lal kuoma chun a feh a, a hril a; chun, Absalom chu a ko a, lal kuomah a feh a; chun, lal hmaa chun hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a; chun, lalin Absalom chu a fâwp tah a."
"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.",Chuong thil hnunga chun Absalom chun tawlailîr le sakawrhai le mi sâwmnga a hmaa tlân dingin a buotsai a.
"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.","Chun, Absalom chu zîngkâr hin a tho a, kul kawtkhâr lampuia chun a lo ngîr hlak a; chun, lal kuoma thupawi hung hril ding taphawt chu Absalom chun a lo ko hlak a, “Khâwlai khuo am in nih a?” a lo ti pei hlak a. Chun, “I siehlaw hi Israel hnam laia hnam pakhat ka nih,” an ti pei hlak a."
"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.","Chun, Absalom chun, “I aw, i thu chu a ṭhain ân dik a, nisienlakhawm, ngaituotu dingin lalin tukhawm a ruot nawh,” a lo ti hlak a."
"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!","Chun, Absalom ma chun, “Mi tin thupawi hril ding nei amanih, hni ding nei amani taphawt chu ka kuoma an hung theina dingin; kei hi hi ram rorêltua hin mi siem sien ka va ti deh aw! chuongchun, feltakin ka rêlpêk hlak ding bah,” dâm a lo ti bawk hlak a."
"And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.","Hieng ang khawm hin a thawh a, tukhawm ama chibai bûk dinga hang hnai taphawthai chu a lo ban a, a chel a, a lo fâwp hlak a."
And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.,"Chuongchun, Israel mi lal kuoma thuhril dinga hung taphawthai chu Absalom chun chuong ang chun a lo thaw pei hlak a. Chuongchun, Absalom chun Israel mihai lungril chu a hlîppêk a."
"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.","Chun, kum li a hung invawi hnung chun, Absalom chun lal kuoma chun, “Ka hni che a nih, Hebron khuoah LALPA kuoma ka thutiem hlen dingin mîn fetir raw khai."
"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.","I siehlaw hin Suria rama Gesura ka um lai khan, ‘LALPAIN Jerusa- lema a mi ṭhuoi nâwk phawt chun LALPA rawng bâwl ka tih,’ tiin thu ka lo tiem tah a nih,” a ta."
"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Lung- muongtakin fe raw khai,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho a, Hebrona chun a fe tah a."
"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.","Nisienlakhawm, Absalom chun, “Tawtawrâwt ri in hriet phingleh, ‘Absalom chu Hebronah lal a nih,’ ti ro,” tiin Israel hnam po pohai lai mi a tir rûk ta hlau a."
"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.","Chun, Absalom kuoma chun, a mi fielhai, mi za hni Jerusalema inthawkin an fe veh a, lungril ṭhatak putin an feh a, iengkhawm an hriet ve nawh."
"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.","Chun, Absalom chun inthâwi- nahai chu ân hlân laiin, Gilon mi Ahithophel, David rorêlpui chu, a khuo Gilo a inthawkin ân chah a, an thu phierrûuk chu a nasa hle el a. Absalom tieng chun mipui chu an pung tul tul el sih a."
"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.","Chun, David kuoma chun, “Israel mihai lungril chu Absalom tieng a thle hle el,” tiin mitir a hung a."
"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.","Chun, David chun Jerusalema a mihai po po kuoma chun, “Tho unla, tlân suok ei tiu, tukhawm Absaloma inthawk hin ei suok thei âwm si nawh a, suok vak ro khai, chuong naw chun mi hung hnawt phâk vak el a tih; ei chunga hin thil ṭha nawtak hung intlun a ta, kâwlhnâmin khuo hi hung thaw rawi a tih,” a ta."
"And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.","Chun, lal mihai chun lal kuomah, “Ngai ta, i siehlawhai hi lal kan lalin a ruot ang peia thaw dingin kan inzo zing a nih,” an ta."
"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.","Chun, lal chu a suok a, a sûnghai po po chun an zui a. Chun, lal chun in nghâk dingin nuhmei sâwm thaikêm ruol chu a sieh a."
"And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.","Chun, lal chu a suok a, mipui po pohai chun an zui a, chun, in tâwpna taka chun an châwl hrih a."
"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.","Chun, a mi po pohai chun an fe khêl a, chun, Kerith mi po pohai, Peleth mi po pohai le Git mi za ruk Gath-a inthawka ama hung zuituhai chun lal chu an pêl pei a."
"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; return to thine own place.","Chuongchun, lal chun Git mi Ittai kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea nang hi i hung ve am?

"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.","Zâni ela hung i na, vawisûn hin a suk a tunga mi zui dingin ka ti ve ding che am a nih? Ka fe theina naah ka fe ding a na, nang chu kîr nâwk la, i unauhai po po hi ṭhuoi kîr rawh, lunginsietna le thutak i kuomah um raw se,” a ta."
"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.","Chun, Ittai chun lal chu a dawn a, “LALPA hringna le lal, ka pu hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, lal ka pu hi i umna taphawta chun thi le thi nîng a ta, dam le dam ning a ta, i siehlaw hi um ve pei a tih,” a ta."
"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.","Chun, David chun, Ittai kuoma chun, “Fe unla, fe pei ro le,” a ta. Chuongchun, Git mi Itai chu a mihai po po le an nauhai po po le chun an feh a."
"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.","Chun, inringtakin a ram phêkin an ṭap tah a, mipui chu an fe vawng a; thlalêr lampui tieng chu panin lal khawm chun Kidron vadung chu a kân a; chun, mipui po po chun an kân bawk a."
"And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.","Chun, Zadok hai, Pathien thu- thlungna bâwm zâwnin Levi mihai po po leh a kuomah an fe veh a; Pathien bâwm chu an innghat a, mipuiin khuo chu an suoksan kim vawng chenin Abiathar chu a hang feh a."
"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:","Chun, lal chun Zadok kuomah, “Pathien bâwm kha khawpui sûngah zâwn kîr nâwk ro, LALPA mittlunga ka um chun mi ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a ta; Pathien bâwm le a umna chu mîn hmutir nâwk a ta;"
"but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.","amiruokchu, ‘Nangmaah lâwm- na hrim ka nei nawh,’ a ti chun, ngai ta, hieng el hi ka na, ṭha a ti ang angin ka chunga hin thaw el raw se,” a ta."
"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou not a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.","Lal chun thiempu Zadok kuoma chun, “Hmu theitu i ni naw am a nih? I naupasalhai pahni i naupa Ahimaaz le Abiathar naupa Jonathan leh lungmuongtakin khawpuiah fe nâwk ro."
"See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.","Ngai ta, kei chu chanchin in mi hung inhriettir hmakhat chu thlalêra vadung kaiahai hin lo um ka tih,” a ta."
Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.,"Chuongchun, Zadok le Abiathar chun Pathien bâwm chu Jerusalema chun an fepui nâwk a; chun, chutaka chun an um tah a."
"And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.","Chuongchun, David chu Oliv tlâng hang fenaa chun a hang feh a, fe malam chun a ṭap malam pei a, a lu a khum a, ke ruokin a feh a; chun, a kuoma mi po pohai chun an lu an khum seng a, ṭap pum peiin an hang feh a."
"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.","Chun, tuin amanih David chu, “Ahithophel chu Absalom tienga ṭhangin thu phiertuhai lai a ṭhang ve,” tiin a hril a. Chun, David chun, “Aw LALPA, Ahithophel remruot chu invêtnaa inchangtir dingin ka ngên che,” a ta."
"And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.","Chun, David chu Pathien biekna tlâng sîp a hang lâwn kai chun, ngai ta, Ark mi Husai chu a zakaw keithlêr hâka, a lua pilvut kâi luomin ama tuok dingin a hung a."
"And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Ka kuoma i fe ve chun keia ta dinga phurrik i ni el ding a na."
"but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.","Amiruokchu, khawpui tieng chun i kîr a, Absalom kuomah, ‘Aw lalpa, i siehlawah um ka tih, kha hma tienga i pa siehlawa ka um ang khan tuhin i siehlawah um thung tâng ka tih,’ i va ti chun Ahithophel remruot mi hluopêktu ni lem i tih."
"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.","Chutaka chun thiempu Zadok le Abiathar khawm an um ve a ni naw am a nih?

"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.","Ngai ta, an naupasalhai pahni Zadok naupa Ahimaaz le Abiathar naupa Jonathan khawm an kuomah an um kha; chun, i thil hriet taphawt chu mi hril dingin anni chu i hung tir hlak ding annâwm,” a ta."
"So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, David ruolpa Husai chu khawpuia chun a lût a; chun, Absalom chu Jerusalema chun a lût tah a."
"And when David was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.","David chun tlâng sîp lâwn suokna a khêl dep chun, ngai ta, Mephiboseth siehlaw Ziba chun a lo tuok a, sabengtung pahni a hmang a, bei tlang zahni le grêp emṭâwl bâwr za le nipui thei za le uoin peng khat ân phurtir a."
"And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.","Chun, lal chun Ziba kuoma chun, “Hieng hi iengtizie am a nih a?” a ta.

"And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.","Chun, lal chun “Anleh, i pu naupa chu khâwlai am?” a ta. Ziba chun lal kuomah, “Ngai ta, Jerusa- lemah a um, ‘Vawisûn hin Israel- hai chun ka pa ram an mi pêk nâwk ding a nih,’ a ti nghe nghe annâw,” a ta."
"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.","Chun, lal chun Ziba kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, Mephiboseth thil nei po po chu i ta vawng a ni tah,” a ta. Chun, Ziba chun, “Chibai ka bûk takzet che a nih, aw lalpa ka pu, i mit tlunga um pei tum ka tih,” a ta."
"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.","Chun, lal Davidin Bahurim a tlung chun, ngai ta, Saula sûnghai laia mi Gera naupa a hming Simei a hung suok a, ṭawngsie inphur pum peiin a hung suok a."
"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.","David chu lungin a dêng a, lal David siehlawhai po po khawm chu; chun, mipui po po le sipai huoisenhai po po chu a changtieng le a vawitieng an um a."
"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:","Chun, Simei chun ṭawngsie ân phur sûng chun hieng hin a hril a, “Fe hmang dai rawh, fe hmang dai rawh, nang thisen insuo hmang le Belial mihriempa,"
"Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.","a rorêl âi i rêl tah Saula sûnghai thisen chu LALPAIN i chungah a hung inlettir tah a; chun, LALPAIN ram chu i naupa Absalom chu a pêk tah a; chun, ngai ta, thisen insuo- hmang i ni leiin nangma pawi chu nang bawkin i tâwk a nih,” a ta."
"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.","Chuongchun, Zeruia naupa Abisai chun lal kuomah, “Iengdinga hi ui thitlaw hin ka lalpa lal chu ṭawngsie ân phur mei mei am a nih a? a lu va tan el ka tih aw?” a ta."
"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?","Nisienlakhawm, lal chun, “Nangni Zeruia naupasalhai, nangni mi lo hrietpêk ding ieng am a um a?

"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more may this Benjamite now do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.","Chun, David chun Abisai le a siehlawhai po po kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, ka naupa ka rîla ra ngei chun mi that a tum a na, hi Benjamin mi hin a va tum nasa nâwk zuol âwm de!

"It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.","LALPA chun ka rimsikzie hi hung hmûng a ta. LALPA chun vawi- sûna hienga ṭawngsie a mîn phur hi a ṭha tiengin a mi hung thung el khawm a ni thei a nih,” a ta."
"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai chu lampuia chun an fe pei tah a; chun, Simei chu an râla tlâng panga chun a fe ve pei a, a fe malam chun ṭawngsie chu ân phur pei a, lunghai dâmin a dêng a, pilvut dâmin a theh a."
"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.","Chun, lal le a kuoma mi um po pohai chun Aiphim an tlung a, chu- taka chun an châwldam tah a."
"And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.","Chun, Absalom le mipui po po, Israel mihai chu Jerusalemah an feh a, chun, a kuomah Ahithophel khawm a ṭhang a."
"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, Long live the king, Long live the king.","Ark mi Husai, David ruolpa chun Absalom kuom a tlung chun, Husai chun Absalom kuomah, “Pa- thienin laltak humhim raw se, Pathienin laltak humhim raw se,” a ta."
"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?","Chun, Absalom chun Husai kuomah, “Hieng ang hi a ni maw i ruol i lunginsiet dân chu? Iengdinga i ruolpa kuoma i fe naw am?” a ta."
"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.","Chun, Husai chun Absalom kuomah, “Fe naw ning ah, LALPA le hieng mipui le Israelhaiin an ithlang thu thuin um ka ta, a kuomah um lem ka tih."
"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.","Chun, tu rawng am ka bâwl ding a na? Naupa hmaah rawng ka bâwl ding a ni naw am a nih? I pa hmaa rawng ka bâwl ang khan i hmaah bâwl ka tih,” a ta."
"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.","Chuongchun, Absalom chun Ahithophel kuoma chun, “Iengtin am ka thaw ding a na, i ngaidân hril ta?” a ta."
"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.","Chun, Ahithophel chun Absa- lom kuomah, “I pa thaikêm in nghâk- a siea umhai kuoma chun va lût rawh; chun, Israel mi po poin i pain a thîm che ti hrieng an ta, chuong- chun, nanga tienga ṭhang po po- hai kut chu a hung hrât ding a nih,” a ta."
So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.,"Chuongchun, Absalom ta ding chun in chungah puon in an zar a; chuongchun, Israel mi po pohai mithmuah a pa thâikêmhai kuoma chun a lût a."
"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.","Chuong laia rem a ruot, Ahithophel remruothai chu, Pathien thu ngai anga ngai a ni hlak a, chuong ang bawk chun, Ahithophelin David le Absalom rem a ruotpuihai po po chu ngai a ni hlak."
"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:","Chu naw khawm chu Absalom kuomah Ahithophel chun, “Tuhin mi sîng khat le sâng hni thlang suok ka ta, chun, vawizân hin David chu hnawt dingin inthawk ka tih;"
"and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;","a châu lai le a hrâtnaw laitak va nangchîng ka ta, va sukṭîng ka tih, chuongchun, a kuoma mi um po pohai chu tlân hmang an ta; chuongchun, lal chau chu va that el ka tih;"
and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.,"chun, mipuihai chu i kuomah hung ṭhuoi kîr vawng ka ta, i mi zawng chu mi po po hung kîr tluk a nih; chuongchun, mi po po inremin um tâng an tih,” a ta."
"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.","Chuongchun, chu thu chun Absalom le Israel upahai po po chu a suklâwm ta hleh a."
"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.","Chun, Absalom chun, “Tu hin Ark mi Husai chu ko ve phawt unla, a hril ve dân lo ngai phawt ei tih,” a ta."
"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.","chun, Husaiin Absalom kuom a hung tlung chun, Absalom chun, “Ahithophel chun hieng ang hin a hril a, a hril ang hin kan thaw ding am a nih? Thaw naw ding ni ta ang inla, nangin hang hril ve ta khai,” a ta."
"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.","Chun, Husai chun Absalom kuomah, “Tuta ṭuma Ahithophel remruot hi a ṭha naw a nih,” a ta."
"Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.","Chun, Husai chun, “I pa le a mihai chu i hriet a, sipai huoitak, mi kâwlhrâwngtak, phûla savawm a tê manpêk ang el an na; chun, i pa hi indo mi a na, mipui lai chun riek khawm riek kher naw ni."
"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.","Ngai ta, tu khawm hin khaw lai khursûnga manih, khawlai hmuna manih ân bi zing a ni ding a na; chun, an inthaw tîra mi ṭhenkhat an tlu nuol chun a hre taphawtin, ‘Absalom zuituhai chu an that ṭeu el ie,’ ti el an ta."
"And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.","Chuongchun, mi huoisentak, sakeibaknei lungril ang put mi meu khawm lo ṭîng a ta, Israel mi po po hlak chun i pa chu sipai huoitak a ni le a kuoma mi umhai chu mi huoisen- tak tak an ni ti an hriet vawng sih a."
"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.","Keia remruot ve dân chu, Israel mi po po chu Dana inthawkin Beer- seba tlung rakin an tamzie tuisuo- rieta phaiphin zât zetin i kuomah ko khâwm la; chun, indonaa khawm chun nang meu khawm fe ve la."
"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.","Chuongchun, khâwlai hmuna khawm ei tuok fûkna taphawtah hnuoia dâidâw tla ang elin bâwng ei ta, chun, ama le a kuoma mi umhai po po chu pakhat khawm hla nâwng ei tih."
"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.","Chu nawa khawm khuoa a lût chun, Israel mi po po, hruihruol chawiin chu khuoa chun va fêng ei ta, lung chiterek khawm um lo khawp rauin vadungah hnûkthla vawng ei tih,” a ti nghâl bawk a."
"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.","Chuongchun, Absalom le Israel mi po pohai chun, “Ark mi Husai remruot chu Ahithophel remruot nêk chun a ṭha lem,” an ti tah a. LALPA chun Absalom chunga chun thil ṭha naw ân tlungtir theina dingin LALPA chun Ahithophel remruot ṭhatak chu letthla dingin a lo ruot ta hrim a nih."
"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.","Chuongchun, Husai chun thiempu Zadok le Abiathar kuomah, “Chuong ang khâng ang chun Ahithophel chun Absalom le Israel upahai chu rem a ruotpêk a; chun, keiin chuong ang khâng ang chun rem ka ruot bawk a."
"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.","Chuleiin, ‘Vawizân chu thlalêra vadung kaiahai riek ta loin kân ngei ngei rawh, chuong naw chun lal le a kuoma um po pohai chu sukbohmang vawng rawi an tih,’ tiin David chu inhriltir vak ro khai,” a ta."
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.,"Jonathan le Ahimaaz chu En-rogelah an um a, suoknu pa- khat hin anni chu a va hril hlak a na, chun, anni chun lal David chu an va hril nâwk sâwng hlak a; khawpuia an lût chu tukhawma hmu lo ding a nih."
"But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.","Nisienlakhawm, naupangin a lo hmuh a, Absalom chu a hril a; chuongchun, an pahni chun an tlân hmang ta vat a, Bahurima mi pakhat, a tuola tuisunsuo nei mi pakhat kâwlah an va feh a, tuisunsuoa chun an lût tah a."
"And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.","Chun, nuhmeiin tuisunsuo sîn- nain a sîn a, a chunga chun bu a em a, tu hriet thei khawm a ni nawh."
"And Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.","Chun, Absalom siehlawhai chu chu ina nuhmei kuoma chun an va feh a, “Ahimaaz le Jonathan kha khaw lai am?” an ta. Chun, nuhmei chun an kuomah, “Vadung kai tâng an tih,” a lo tih a. Chun, an va zawng a, an hmu nawh a, Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a."
"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.","Chun, an fe liem hnung chun tuisunsuoa inthawk chun an hung suok a, lal David chu an va hril a, David kuoma chun, “Suok unla, vadung chu kai vak ro, hieng ang hin Ahithophel chun a phier cheu a nih,” an ta."
"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.","Chuongchun, David le a kuoma mi um po pohai chu an suok a, Jordan vadung an kai a, khuo a hung var chun pakhat khawm Jordan vadung kai lo an um nawh."
"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.","Chun, Ahithophel chun a rem- ruot ang chu an pawm nawh ti a hrietin a sabengtung chu a siem a, a suok a, a khuo tieng a fe tah a, a sûnghai khawsak dân ding a ruotpêk diem a, ân âwkhlum tah a; chuong- chun, a thih a, a pa thlânah an phûm tah a."
"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.","Chun, David chun Mahanaim a va tlung a. Chun, Absalom chun a kuoma Israel mi po pohai leh Jordan vadung an kai a."
"And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.","Chun, Absalom chun, Joab aiah Amasa chu sipaihai hotuah a sieh a. Amasa chu mi pakhat a hming Ithra, Ismael mi, Joab nu Zeruia zuorpuinu Nahas naunu Abigail pâwltu naupa a nih."
And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.,"Chun, Absalom le Israel mihai chun Gilead rama chun ṭhanghmun an va khuor a."
"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,","Chun, Davidin Mahanaim a tlung chun Ammon thla Rabba khuoa mi Nahas naupa Sobi hai, Lodebar khuoa mi Ammiel naupa Makir hai, Rogelim khuoa Gilead mi Barzillai hai chun,"
"brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,","khumhai dâm, maihûnhai dâm, pil bêlhai dâm, bu dâm, buṭei dâm, beiphit dâm, bu zêu dâm, dailuo dâm, bê dâm,"
"and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.","khuoizu dâm, bâwng nêne kîng dâm, berâm le bâwng nêne kîng thûm dâm, David le a kuoma mi umhai fâk dingin an hung chawi a, “Mipuihai chu thlalêra chun an phîngṭamin an chauin an dang châr êm êm tah a nih,” ti a ni sih a."
"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.","Chun, David chun a kuoma mi umhai chu a tiem a, sipai sâng chunga hotu dâm, za chunga hotu dâm a siem a."
"And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.","Chun, David chun mihai chu a tirsuok a, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Joab chun ân rawi a, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Joab unaupa Zeruia naupa, Abisaiin ân rawi a, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Git mi Ittai chun ân rawi a. Chun, lal chun mipuihai kuomah, “Keima ngei khawm in kuomah fe ve ngei ngei ka tih,” a ta."
"But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun, “Fe ve lo e, keini rawi hi chu tlân hmang ta ang ni inla khawm, pawi ti naw ni hai a; chun, a chenve lai rau khawm hi va thi inla khawm an ûksak bar âwm nawh a, nang chu keinirawi sîng tlukin i hlu sih a, chuleiin, khawpuia inthawka mi ṭhangpui dinga inzosa zinga i lo um chu a ṭha lem a nih,” an ta."
"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.","Chun, lal chun an kuomah, “Ṭha in ti ang pei chun thâwng ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, lal chu kul kawtkhâr bula chun a ngîr a; chun, mipui po po chu za têl têl le sâng têl têl chun an suok ta zut zut el a."
"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.","Chun, lal chun Joab le Abisai le Ittai chu, “Keima leiin tlangvâl Absalom chu indawitakin va thaw ro khai,” tiin thu a pêk a. Mipui po poin Absalom chungchâng thuah lalin sipai hotuhai po po thu a pêk lai chu an hriet a."
So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.,"Chuongchun, mipuihai chu Israel mihai chu do dingin indona hmun tieng chun an fe tah a; chun, an indona chu Ephraim rampui hnuoiah a nih."
"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.","Chun, chutaka chun David mihai hmaa chun Israel mihai chu an tlâwm tah a; chun, chutaka chun chu ni chun mi sîng hni zet an that a."
For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.,"An indona chun chuong lai ram po po chu a huop vawng el sih a, chu ni chun kâwlhnâm nêk hmanin rampui chun a lem tam lem a nih."
"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.","Chun, Absalom chun David mihai chu a vân tuokpui ta thut a. Chun, Absalom chu a sabengtung lien chi chungah a chuong a; chun, sa- bengtung chu thingsaisuo kau inbuktak hnuoiah a lût a, a lu chu thingsaisuoa chun ân tâng tah a, hnuoi tâwk lo, vân tâwk lo chun ân khai ta zing el a; chun, sabengtung hlak chu a fe pei tah a."
"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.","Chun, tuin amani hin a hmuh a, Joab a hril a, “Ngai ta, thingsaisuoah Absalom inkhai zingin ka hmu,” a ta."
"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.","Chun, Joab chun a hriltu kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, chu chu i hmu sih a, iengdinga i sukhluma hnuoia i suk- thlâk nghâl naw? chuong chun thaw la chu tangka sâwm le kâwngkhi ka pêk ding che bah,” a ta."
"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.","Chun, mi chun Joab kuomah, “Tangka sâng khawm hmu ding ni lang lal naupa chungah ka kut thlâk naw hrim hrim ka tih; kan na hriet ngeiah lalin nang le Abisai le Ittai kuomah, ‘Tlangvâl Absalom chu tukhawma tâwk naw raw se,’ tiin thu a pêk si cheu a."
"Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.","Ringumlotakin lo that ta ringawt inla, (lal kuoma chun ieng- khawm thup thei a ni âwm si nawh a) nang chu în sukfihlîm nâwk el âwm sih a,” a ta."
"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.","Chuongchun, Joab chun, “Hieng hin chu i kuomah ka um zing thei naw tawp el a,” a ta, fei pathum a chawi a, thingsaisuo laia Absalom dama lo la umzing lungkhura chun a sun a."
"And ten young men that bare Joab’s armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.","Chun, Joab râlthuom chawitu tlangvâl sâwm chun an hung inhuol a, Absalom chu an sun a, an that tah a."
"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.","Chun, Joab chun tawtawrâwt a hei mût a, Israel hnawttu mipuihai chu an hung kîr tah a, Joab chun mipuihai chu a lo dang tlat el tah a."
"And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.","Chun, Absalom ruong chu an lâk a, rampui hnuoia khursûng in- thûktaka chun an peilût a, a chunga chun nasatakin lung an dêng khâwm a, chun, Israel mihai po po chu mâni puon in sengah an tlân tah a."
"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument, unto this day.","Absalom chun a dam laiin lal ruoma chun lung intieng a lo intieng diem tah a, “Ka hming a dei nawna dingin, naupasal khawm ka nei si nawh a,” a ta. Chu lung intieng hminga chun ama hming ân puttir a, tu chen hin Absalom hriet zingna ti a nih."
"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.","Chuongchun, Zadok naupa Ahimaaz chun, “Va tlân ka ta, LALPAIN a hmêlma phuba a lâkpêk dân chanchin hi lal chu va hril ka tih,” a ta."
"And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.","Chun, Joab chun a kuomah, “Vawisûn chu chanchin chu va hril naw rawh, ni dangah chanchin chu la hril lem rawh, lal naupa chu a thi ta leiin, vawisûn chu chanchin ieng- khawm va hril naw rawh,” a ta."
"Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.","Chuongchun, Joab chun Kus mi kuoma chun, “Fe la, i thil hmu chu lal va hril raw le,” a ta. Chun, Kus mi chun kûnin Joab chu chibai a bûk a, a tlân tah a."
"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?","Chuongchun, Zadok naupa Ahimaaz chun Joab kuomah, “Ieng- khawm ni sienla, Kus mi kha va hnawtzui ka tih,” a ti nâwk a. Chun, Joab chun, “Ka naupa, chanchin hril man chu i hmu âwm si nawh a, iengdingin am tlân i ta?” a ta."
"But come what may, said he, I will run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “Iengkhawm ni sien tlân ka tih,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Tlân el raw le,” a ta. Chuongchun, Ahimaaz chu phaizâwl tieng lampuiah a tlân a, Kus mi chu a lekhêl a."
"Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.","Chuongchun, David chu dai- kawtkhâr pahni inkâra chun a lo ṭhung a; chun râl vêngtu chu kul kawtkhâr tuolpuo lem chung tieng chun a hang lâwn a, a hang ngha vêl a, mi pakhat a khât baka hung tlân a hmu a."
"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.","Chun, râl vêngtu chu a khêk a, lal chu a hril a. Chun, lal chun “Mi pakhat bak a ni chun chanchin hung hril ding ni ngei a tih,” a ta."
"And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.","Chun, a hung vat vat a, a hung hnai ta deu deu a.

Chun, lal chun, “Ama khawm chun chanchin a hung intlun ve ding a ni chu,” a ta."
"And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.","Chun, râl vêngtu chun, “A hmasa lem tlân dân chu Zadok naupa Ahimaaz tlân dân ni âwm- takin ka hriet,” a ta. Chun, lal chun, “Ama chu mi ṭhatak a na, chanchin ṭhatak a hung intlun ding nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.","Chun, Ahimaaz chun a ko a, lal kuomah, “A ṭha vawng ie,” a ta.

"And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.","Chun, lal chun, “Tlangvâl Absa- lom kha a la dam de maw?” a ta.

"And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.","Chun, lal chun, “Ka sîra hin la hung ngîr hri ta,” a ta. Chun, a sîra chun a hung ngîr a."
"And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.","Chun, ngai ta, Kus mi chu a hung tlung a; chun, Kus mi chun, “Lalpa, ka lalpa ta dingin chan- chin ka hung intlun a nih, i chunga helhai po po phuba chu LALPAIN vawisûn hin a lâkpêk ta che a nih,” a ta."
"And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.","Chun, lal chun Kus mi kuoma chun, “Tlangvâl Absalom chu a la dam de maw?” a ta.

"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!","Chuongchun, lal chu a lungin- zîng ta hle el a, kul kawtkhâr chunga pindana chun a hang feh a, a ṭap a; chun, a hang fe malam chun, “Aw, ka naupa Absalom, ka naupa, ka naupa Absalom, i aia chun kei hi hang thi lem lang aw, Aw Absalom, ka naupa, ka naupa!” a ta."
"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.","Chuongchun, Joab chu an hril a, “Ngai ta, lal chun Absalom chu a ṭah a, a sûn ie,” an ta."
"And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son.","Chuongchun, chu nia an hnena chu mi po po ta dinga sûnna a lo ni ta lem a; “Lal chu a naupa lei chun a lungngai nasa khawp el a,” an ti chu mipui chun chu ni chun an lo hriet ta sih a."
"And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.","Chun, mipuihai chu indonaa mi an tlânsieh a, an inzak a, inrûka an fe hmang angin chu ni chun a rûkin khawpuia chun an lût a."
"And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!","Chun, lal chun a hmai a hup a, “Aw ka naupa Absalom, Aw Absalom, ka naupa, ka naupa,” tiin lal chu a ṭap a ṭap a."
"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;","Chun, Joab chu inah lal kuoma chun a lût a, “I hringna dâm, i nau- pahai le i naunuhai hringna dâm, i nuhmeihai le i thaikêmhai sanhim- tuhai chu vawisûn hin inzaktakin i siem ta hi;"
"in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.","nangma hmangaituhai che i theidah a, nangma theidatuhai che chu i hmangai tlata hin.

"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.","Chuleiin tho la, suok el rawh, i mihai suklungawi zâwngtakin thu hril rawh, i suok naw chun LALPA sâlin ṭawng kân khâm a nih; mi pakhat khawm vawizân hin i kuoma um um naw ni hai; chun, chu chu i ta dingin i tleirâwla inthawka tu chena i chunga thil ṭha naw hung tlung po pohai nêk hmanin ṭha naw lem a tih,” a ta."
"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.","Chuongchun, lal chu a tho a, kul kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a; “Ngai ta u, lal chu kul kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a,” tiin mipui po po chu an hril a; chun, mipui po po chu lal hmaa chun an va fe tah a."
"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.","Israelhai ruok chu anni puon in sengah an fe tah a. “Lal chun ei hmêlmahai kuta inthawkin a mi sansuok a, Philistin mihai kuta inthawkin a mi sandam tah a; chun, tuhin hi rama inthawk hin Absalom chu a tlân hmangsan a."
"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?","Chun, Absalom ei lal dinga hriek ei nâl chu indonaah a thi tah sih a, iengdinga lal chu baukhat bêka a ko kîr zâi in rêl naw am a ni leh?” tiin Israel mi po pohai chu an insêl ta mur mur el a."
"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, to bring him to his house.","Chuongchun, lal David chun thiempu Zadok le Abiathar kuoma chun, “Juda upahai kuoma chun, ‘Iengdinga lal chu a in tienga ṭhuoi kîr ding thuah a muongtaka ṭhang am in nih a?

"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants.","Chuongchun, Judahai po po lungril chu mi pakhat lungril ang elin a sukthle ta duol a; chuongchun, lal kuomah, “I mihai po po le khan hung kîr nâwk ro,” ti dingin mi an tir tah a."
"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.","Chuongchun, lal chu a kîr nâwk a, Jordan a va tlung a. Chun, Judahai chu lal lo tuok a, lal chu Jordan lo ṭhuoikai dingin Gilgala chun an feh a."
"And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.","Chun, Bahurim khuoa mi Ben- jamin mi Gera naupa Simei chu in- hmawtakin lal David tuok ding chun Judahai ruolin a hung thla veh a."
"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.","Chun, a kuoma chun Benjamin mi sâng le, Saula sûnghai siehlaw, Ziba, a naupasalhai sâwm le panga le, a siehlaw sâwmhnihai leh an ṭhang ve a; chun, lal mithmua chun Jordan chu an kai a."
"And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good.

"And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “Ka lalpa chun khawhlona neiah mi ruot naw hrâm sienla, lalpa ka puin Jerusalem a suoksan nia i siehlaw hin indik nawtaka a lo thaw tahai kha hre zing bawk naw la, lal chun lungrilah vawn zing naw raw se."
"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.","I siehlaw hin thil ka lo suksuol ti kân hriet a; chuleiin, ngai ta, Josef sûng po pohai laia ka pu lal chu tuok dingin vawisûn hin a hung thla hmasa tak ka hung ni nghe nghe annaw,” a ta."
"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah’s anointed?","Nisienlakhawm, Zeruia naupa Abisai chun a dawn a, “LALPA hriek- nâl chu ṭawngsie ân phur leiin Simei hi sukhlum ding a ni naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
"And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?","Chun, David chun, “Nangni Ze- ruia naupasalhai, nangni hin in mi lo hriet pêk ding ieng am a um a?

"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.","Chun, Saula naupa Mephi- boseth chu lal tuok dingin a hung thlah a; lal a fe suoka râlmuonga a hung kîr nâwk ni chen chun a kehai chu a chei nawh a, a khâkhmul chu a chep ruol bawk nawh a, a puonhai khawm chu a sâwp nawh a."

"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Aw, lalpa ka pu, ka siehlawin a mi hlêm a nih; i siehlaw hin, ‘Lal kuoma ka fena dingin sabengtung chei ka tih,’ ka tih a, i siehlaw hi ka ke ân bâi sih a."
And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.,"Chun, lalpa ka pu kuoma hin i siehlaw hi a hêk a, nisienlakhawm, lalpa ka pu chu Pathien vântirko ang a na, chuleiin ṭha i ti ang angin thaw el rawh."
For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?,"Ka pa sûnghai po po chu lalpa ka pu hmaa chun sukhlum vawng âwm an na, nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw hi i buthlêng awtpuituhai lai ân ṭhangtir a.

"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “I chungchâng thu hi iengdinga i hril nâwk hlak am? Nang le Ziba chun ram chu insem ro ka ti a nih,” a ta."
"And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.","Chun, Mephiboseth chun lal kuomah, “E, amân nei vawng el raw se, lalpa ka pu chu inah râlmuongin a hung tlung ta sih a,” a ta."
"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.","Chun, Gilead mi Barzillai chu Rogelim-a inthawkin a hung thlah a, lal chun Jordana ṭhuoikai dingin a kuomah Jordan a kai veh a."
"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.","Barzillai chu upatak a na, kum sâwmriet mi zet a nih; Mahanaima lal um sûng khan fâk ding dâm a lo tumpêk a, mi neinungtak a nih."
"And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.","Chun, lal chun Barzillai kuoma chun, “Ka kuoma fe ve la, ka kuomah Jerusalemah châwm ka ti che,” a ta."
"And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?","Chun, Barzillai chun lal kuom- ah, “Ieng chen tak am la damin lal kuoma Jerusalema chun hang fe vêng ka ta?"
I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?,"Tuhin kum sâwmriet mi ka na, a sie le ṭha khawm thlier thei am ka la nih?

Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?,I siehlaw hin lal kuoma Jordan râl kai ve chau hi ka tum a nih; iengdingin am lal chun chuong ang chun ṭhat man chu mi thung ve kher a ta?
"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.","Lunginsiettakin i siehlaw hi mîn fetir nâwk el la, ka nu le pa thlân umna keini khuo ngeiah thi de ning.

"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, “Kim- ham chu ka kuomah fe vêng a tih, ṭha i ti ang peiin a chungah thâwng ka tih; chun, thil iengkhawm i mi hni ta- phawt chu thawpêk pei ka ti che,” a ta."
"And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.","Chun, mipui po pohai chu Jordan râl an kai a; chun, lal khawm chu a kai veh a; chun, lal chun Barzil- lai chu a fâwp a, mal a sâwm a; chun, ama hmun tieng a fe nâwk tah a."
"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.","Chuongchun, lal chu Gilgala chun a kai a. Kimham chu a kuoma chun a kai ve a; chun, Juda mi po pohai chun lal chu an ṭhuoi kai a; Israel mi khawm a zâtve an ṭhang."
"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?","Chun, Israel mi po po chu lal kuomah an hung a, lal kuoma chun, “Iengdinga kan unau Juda mihai hin an chang bîk cheh a, lal le a sûnghai le David mihai po po khawm Jordan râla an ṭhuoi sa vawng el?” an ta."
"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?","Chun, Juda mi po pohai chun Israel mihai chu an dawn a, “Lal chu keini tieng hnai a ni lei a nih, iengdinga hi thua hin in lunginsen el am?

"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.","Chun, Israel mihai chun Juda mihai chu an dawn a, “Lala hin chan sâwm kan nei a, Davida hin nangni nêkin chan kan nei lem a nih.

"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.","Chun, chu hnunga chun David chun, “Juda ram khâwlai ama- niah ka hang fe ding?” tiin LALPA a rawn a. Chun, LALPA chun a kuomah, “Hang fe raw khai,” a ta.

"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.","Chuongchun, David chu chutaka chun a hang fe tah a, a nuhmeihai pahni Jezreel mi Ahinoam le Kar- mela Nabal nuhmei Abigail le khan."
"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.","Chun, David chun a kuoma mi um po pohai chu a ṭhuoi a, mi tin an sûngkuohai seng leh, Hebron khuoa chun an um a."
"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.","Chun, Juda rama mihai an va feh a, Juda mihai chunga lal dingin David chu hriek an nâl tah a.

"And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun in chungah zainêmna le thutak inlang- tir sienla, hieng thil in thaw lei hin kei khawma in lunginsietna man chu thung ka ti cheu."
"Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.","Chuongchun, in kuthai chu hung hrât sienla, huoitakin um ro, in lalpa Saula chu a thi ta sih a; chun, Juda chihai chun an chunga lal dingin hriek an mi nâl ta bawk a,” a ta."
"Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;","Chun, Nera naupa Abner, Saula sipai hotu chun Saula naupa Is- boseth chu Mahanaimah a ṭhuoi a,"

"Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.","(Saula naupa Is-boseth chu Israel chunga ro a rêl ṭan lai chun kum sâwmli mi a na, kum hni ro a rêl a).

And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.,Davidin Hebrona Juda chihai chunga ro a rêlna chu kum sari le thla ruk a ni tah a.
"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.","Chun, Nera naupa Abner le Saula naupa Is-boseth siehlawhai chu Mahanaima inthawk an suok a, Gibeonah an feh a."
"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.","Chun, Zeruia naupa Joab le David siehlawhai chu an fe suok a, Gibeon dîla chun an intuok a; chuong- chun, pâwl khat chu dîl râl khing- tieng chun an ṭhung a, pâwl khat dang chu dîl râl khingtieng chun."
"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.","Chun, Abner chun Joab kuom- ah, “Tlangvâlhai chu hung inthawk- hai sienla, ei hmaa hin hang inthaw ta hai sienla,” a ta. Chun, Joab chun, “Hung inthawk e â,” a ta."
"Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.","Chuongchun, an inthawk a, an ni zât chin ruot chie chu an kai a, Benjamin chi Saula naupa Is-boseth tienga ṭhang chu sâwm le pahni; chun, David siehlawhai chu sâwm le pahni bawk."
"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.","An khingpuihai chu an lu sengah an inman a, mâni bitumhai chu an nâkah kâwlhnâmin an insun seng a; chuongchun, an tlu ta vawng el a; chuleiin, chu hmun chu Helkath-Hazurim an ti tah a; chu chu Gibeona um a nih."
"And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.","Chuongchun, chu nia an inthaw chu a nasa ta hle a, chun, Abner le Israel mihai chu David siehlawhai hmaa chun an tlâwm tah a."
"And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.","Chun, chutaka chun Zeruia naupasalhai pathum Joab le Abisai le Asahel hai chu an um a, Asahel chu sazukpui ang ela ngal hrât a nih."
And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.,"Chuongchun, Asahel chun Abner chu a hnawt a, Abner a hnawt chu changtieng le vawitieng khawm pêt hlek loin a hnawt a."
"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.","Chuongchun, Abner chu a hang nghale a, “Nang i ni maw Asahel?” a hei tih a. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Kei ka nih ie,” a ta."
"And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.","Chun, Abner chun, a kuomah, “I changtieng amanih, i vawitieng amani khan pêt la, tlangvâl pakhat kha man la, a râlthuom kha lâkpêk rawh,” a ta.

"Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.","Nisienlakhawm, a pêt nuom chuong nawh a, chuleiin, Abner chun a feiṭhut tiengin a phîngah a sun a, a fei chu a hnungtieng a tlang a, chutaka chun a tlu ta tawp a, chu hmuna chun a thi tah a; chun, Asahel a tlûka a thina hmun hung tlung taphawthai chu chutaka chun an ngîr chawt pei a."
"But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.","Nisienlakhawm, Joab le Abisai chun Abner chu an hnawt pei a, chun, Gibeon thlalêr lampuia Gia dep Amma tlâng an tlung chun nisa a tla tah a."
"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.","Chun, Benjamin thlahai chu Abner kuoma chun an pungkhâwm a, pâwl khatah an insiem a, tlâng sîpa chun an va ngîr tah a."
"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?","Chuongchun, Abner chun Joab chu a ko a, “Kâwlhnâm hin a vât zing ding am a nih?

"And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.","Chun, Joab chun, “Pathien hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ieng- khawm lo hril naw la chu mipuihai chu zîngkâr khan an fe hmang ta ding a na, an unauhai chu an hnawt naw ding bah,” a ta."
"So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.","Chuongchun, Joab chun taw- tawrâwt chu a hei mût a, mipuihai chu an ngîr ta ṭhuop a, Israel mihai chu an hnawt ta nawh a, an thaw nâwk ta nawh a."
"And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.","Chuongchun, Abner le a mihai chu chu zân chun zânkhawvârin an feh a, chun, Jordan an kai a, Bithron an fe thleng rak a, Mahanaim an tlung tah a."
"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.","Chun, Joab chu Abner a hnawt chu a kîr tah a; chun, mipuihai po po a hei ko khâwm chun David rawihai sâwmpakuo le Asahel an lo kim ta nawh a."

"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.","Chuongchun, Asahel ruong chu an lâk a, Bethlehema a pa thlânah an phûm a. Chun, Joab le a mihai chu zânkhawvârin an feh a, Hebron an tlung chun khuo a var a."
"And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.","Chun, chutaka chun Benjamin mi, Bikri naupa a hming Seba, Belial mi pakhat a lo um hlau el a; tawtawrâwt a mût a, “Davida hin chanvo ei nei ve nawh a, Jesai naupaa hin rohluo ding ei nei bawk nawh, aw Israel mihai, in puon in tieng seng fe ro,” a ta."
"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Israel mi po poin David an zui chu an mâksan a, Bikri naupa Seba chu an zui tah a; Juda mihai ruok chun Jordana inthawka Jerusalem chenin an lal chu an inkawppui ta tlat a."
"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.","Chuongchun, David chun Jeru- salema a in chu a tlung a; chun, lal chun nuhmei sâwm a thaikêmhai in nghâk dinga a siehai chu a ṭhuoi a, a khum a, an fâk ding a pêk a, nisien- lakhawm, an kuomah a lût nawh a. Chuongchun, an thi ni chena khuma umin, hmeithaiin an um tah a."
"Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.","Chun, lal chun Amasa kuomah, “Ni thum sûngin Juda mihai mi ko khâwmpêk la, chun, nang khawm hung ṭhang ve bawk la,” a ta."
So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.,"Chuongchun, Amasa chu Juda mihai ko khâwm dingin a fe tah a; amiruokchu, a hun ruotpêk nêkin a va thang sâwt tah a."
"And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.","Chuongchun, David chun Abisai kuomah, “Bikri naupa Seba hin Absalom nêk hmanin ei pawi a tâwk ding a nih ie, i pu mihai hi ṭhuoi la, hnawt ro khai; chuong naw chun khaw kul neia dam lût hman a ta, ei hmu phâk nawa hin insuo hlau rawi ei tih,” a ta."
"And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.","Chuongchun, Joab rawihai, Kereth mihai le, Peleth mihai le an mi hrâthai po po chun ama an zui suok tah a; Jerusalema inthawk chun Bikri naupa Seba chu hnawt dingin an suok tah a."
"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.","Gibeona lungpui umna an va tlung chun Amasa chun anni chu a lo tuok a. Chun, Joab chu indona thuomhnawin ân chei a; chun, a chunga chun kâwlhnâm a bâwm pumin, kâwngkhia chun a pai a; chun, a fe malam chun a kâwlhnâm chu damtein a phawi a."
"And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.","Chun, Joab chun Amasa kuoma chun, “Unaupa, i ṭha pei de maw?” a ta. Chun, Joab chun Amasa chu fâwp tumin a khâkhmul chu a kut changtiengin a chel a."
"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.","Nisienlakhawm, Amasa chun Joabin kâwlhnâm a chawi chu a ngai- sak nawh a; chuongchun, a phînga chun a sun a, a rîlhai chu a sukthlâk nuoi el a, a sun nawn nâwk ta nawh a; chuongchun, a thi tah a. Chuong- chun, Joab le a unaupa Abisai chun Bikri naupa Seba chu an hnawt tah a."
"And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.","Chun, a kâwlah Joab rawihai laia tlangvâl pakhat chu a ngir a, “Joab le David tienga ṭhang taphawt chun Joab hi zui pei raw se,” a tih a."
"And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.","Chun, Amasa chu lamlien laitakah a thisenin a lo inchie nuoi el a. Chun, ama chun mi po po ngîr zinga a hmu chun Amasa ruong chu lamliena inthawk chun phûl tienga sawnin puonin ân khum a, a kâwla hung taphawt chu an ngîr peia a hmu leiin."
"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.","Chun, lamliena inthawka sie hmang a ni hnung chun Bikri naupa Seba chu hnawt dingin mi po po chun Joab chu an zui tah a."
"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.","Chun, Abel chen le, Beth-maaka chenin Israel hnam po pohai le Ber mihai po po khawm chu a sir vawng a; chun, an pungkhâwm a, ama an zui ve a."
"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.","Chun, Beth-maakaa Abel khuoa chun an inhuol a; chun, a khaw hrûla chun hnuoi an dêng pâwng a, kul hrûla chun a ngîr a, chun, Joab kuoma mi um po pohai chun kul chu sukchim dingin an suk tlut tlut a."
"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.","Chuongchun, nuhmei var pa- khat khuoa inthawk chun a hung khêk a, “Khai khai, Joab kuomah, ‘Hung hnâi raw khai, i kuomah thu lo hril ka ti khai,’ a tih, hang ti ro khai,” a tih a."
"And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.","Chun, a kuoma chun a va fe hnai a, chun, nuhmei chun, “Joab i ni maw?” a tih a. “Nih e,” a tih a, a dawn a. Chuongchun, a kuomah, “I suoknu thuhril hi ngai ta,” a tih a. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Ka lo ngai ie,” a tih a."
"Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.","Chuongchun, “Tienlai chun, ‘Abel khuoa hin inrawn phawt an ta,’ an ti hlak a, chuong ang chun thu an suktâwp hlak."
I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?,"Kei hi Israelhai laia inrem nuom le ringum pâwl ka na, nang chun Israel khuo, a khaw bulpui hi suksiet i tum a ni hi, LALPA ro chu iengdinga sukhmang i tum am a na?” tiin a hril a."
"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.","Chun, Joab chun a dawn a, “Chuong ang chu a ni naw tawp el, sukhmang amanih, suksiet amanih ka tum naw hrim hrim. Chuong ang tieng thu chu a ni nawh;"
"The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.","Ephraim tlâng rama Bikri naupa Seba chun lal David ngei chu dodâlin a kut ân let a; ama chu mi pe el unla, khuo chu suoksan el kan tih,” a tih a. Chun, nuhmei chun Joab kuomah, “Ngai ta, a lu chu kulah hung pei liempêk kan ti che,” a tih a."
"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chu a varna hmang chun mipui po pohai lai chun a feh a. Chun, Bikri naupa Seba lu chu an tan a, Joab kuom tieng chun an thedawk a. Chun, tawtawrâwt a mût a, mâni puon in tieng seng, khuoa inthawk chun an indar tah a. Chun, Joab chu Jerusalemah lal kuoma chun a fe nâwk tah a."
Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;,"Joab chu Israelhai po po sipai hotu a na, chun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu Kereth mi le Peleth mihai hotu a nih;"
and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;,"chun, Adoniram chu sinthawa ruoiluihai hotu a nih; chun, Ahilud naupa, Jehosaphat chu chanchin ziektu a na;"
and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;,"Seva chu lekha ziektu a na, chun, Zadok le Abiathar chu thiempu an nih;"
and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister unto David.,"chun, Jair mi Ira khawm chu David thiempu a nih."
"And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.","Chun, David damlai chun a kum bi sirin kum thum ṭâm a tlah a; chun, David chun LALPA chu a rawn a. Chun, LALPA chun, “Thisen insuotu Saula le a sûnghai lei a nih; Gibeon mihai a that el si a,” a ta."
"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);","Chun, lal chun Gibeon mihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, (Gibeon mihai chu Israel thlahai an ni nawh a, Amor mi la um sunhai kha an ni lem a; Israel thlahai chun an chunga chun ṭawng an lo inkhâm tah a; Saula chun Juda thlahai le Israel thlahai ta dinga ṭhahnem a ngai leiin that a tum el hlak a nih)."
"and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?","David chun Gibeon mihai kuoma chun, “Iengam thawpêk ka ti cheu a? LALPA ro chu mal in sâwm theina dingin ieng ang inremna am siempêk ka ti cheu a?” a ta."
"And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.","Chun, Gibeon mihai chun a kuomah, “Saula le a sûnghai le kan chungthua hin tangka le rângkachak tieng thu a ni nawh a, Israel mihai lai hin mi sukhlum theina kan nei bawk nawh,” an ta. Chun, ama chun, “In hril ang taphawt chu thawpêk ka ti cheu,” a ta."
"And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “A mi sukbohmangtu le Israel ram sûng hrim hrima khawm um loa, sukbo- hmang dinga a mi phiertu chu,"
"let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them.","a naupasalhai pasari mi pe la, LALPA mi ruot Saula umna khuo Gibea khuoa chun LALPA hmaah khai kan tih,” an ta. Chun, lal chun, “Pe e â,” a ta."
"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.","Nisienlakhawm, lal chun LALPA kuomah David le Saula naupa Jonathan kâra, an pahni inkâra ṭawng inkhâmna leiin Saula naupa Jonathan naupa Mephiboseth chu a hum a."
"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:","Lal chun Aia naunu Rizpain Saula naupasal pahni a neipêk Armoni le Mephiboseth chu a ṭhuoi a; chun, Meholath mi Barzillai naupa Adriel, Saula naunu Mikalin nau- pasal panga a neipêkhai leh;"
"and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell all seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.","chun, Gibeon mihai kuta chun ân hlân a, chun, anni chun LALPA hmaah thingah an khai a, chuong- chun, an pasari chun hmunkhatah an thi seng a, bu sîk hun, buṭei sîk hun vêl laiin an sukhlum a."
"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.","Chun, Aia naunu Rizpa chun saiip puon a lâk a, bu sîk ṭantira inthawka vâna inthawka tuiin a hung burkhum chena a umna dingin, lungpui chungah ân zar khum a; an chunga sûna chunglêng vatehai fûk le ramsahai um khawm a phal nawh a."
"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.","Chun, Aia naunu Saula thai- kêm Rizpa thilthaw chu David chu an hril a."
"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;","Chun, David chu a feh a, Philistin mihaiin Gilboaa Saula an that nia Philistin mihaiin Beth-san muol laia an khai inrutu, Jabes- Gilead mihai kuoma inthawkin Saula ru le a naupa Jonathan ruhai chu a lâk a."
and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.,"Chutaka Saula ru le a naupa Jonathan ruhai chu a lâk a; chuong- chun, an khaihai ru khawm chu an lâk khâwm a."
"And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.","Chun, Saula ru le a naupa Jonathan ruhai chu Benjamin rama Zela khuoa a pa Kis thlânah an phûm a, chun, lal thupêk ang pei chun an thawh a. Chun, chu hnunga chun chu ram chunga chun Pathien a lungâwi tah a."
"And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;","Philistin mihai chun Israel mihai chu an do nâwk a; chun, David chu a mihai le chun an fe thlah a; Philistin mihai chu an zu do a, chun, David chu a hung chau ta hle el a."
"and Ishbi-benob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.","Chun, Isbi-benod, mi lien naupasalhai laia mi, a fei rikzie chu dâr Shekel za thum, kâwlhnâm thar pai chun David chu that a tum a."
"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Zeruia naupa Abisai chun a san a, Philistin mi chu a thawh a, a that tah a. Chun, David mihai chun, “Israelhai khâwnvar hi i sukmit nawna dingin indo dingin kan kuomah suok ve ta dêr naw ti nih,” tiin a chungah ṭawng an inkhâm a."
"And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.",Chu hnunga chun Philistin mihai leh Gob khuoah indona a um nâwk a; chutaka chun Husath mi Sibbekai chun mi lien naupasalhai laia mi Saph a that a.
"And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.","Chun, Philistin mihai leh Gob khuoah an indo nâwk a; chun, Bethlehem mi Jaare-oregim naupa Elhananin Git mi Goliath a that a, a fei ngul chu puon khâwngtu puon- kawl ang a nih."
"And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.","Chun, Gath khuoah indona a um nâwk a, chutaka chun mi insâng- tak el a kut khingtieng khingtienga kutpâr paruk, a ke khingtieng khingtienga kepâr paruk, a rênga sâwmhni le pali nei hi a um a; ama khawm chu mi liena inthawka pieng a nih."
"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, slew him.","Chun, Israel mihai chu a va cho a, David unau Simei naupa Jonathan chun a lo that a."
"These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.","Chun, chuong palihai chu Gath khuoa mi liena inthawka pieng an na, chuonghai chu David le a mihai kutah an thih a."
"And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:","Chun, David chun a hmêl- mahai po po kuta inthawk le Saula kuta inthawk LALPAIN a sansuok ni chun hi hla thu hi LALPA kuomah a hril a;"
"and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;","chuongchun, ama chun: “LALPA chu ka lungpui le ka kulpui le a mi sanhimtu a na, ka ta ngei a nih;"
"God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence.","Ka lungpui, Pathien ama chu ring ka ta, Ka phaw le ka sandamna ki, ka kulbîng insâng le kân humhimna a nih; Ka sandamtu, nangin inpâwngnêknaa inthawkin i mi sandam hlak."
"I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.","Inpâktlâk LALPA chu ko ka ta, Chuongchun, a mi dotuhaia inthawka sandamin um ka tih."
For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:,"Thina hung insawk chun a mîn huol vêl a, Pathien ngaisak nawna tuilien chun a mi suklau a."
The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.,"Seol hruihruolhai chun a mi khuop vêl a, Thina chânghai chun a mi âwk bawk a."
"In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry came into his ears.","Ka lunginzîngin LALPA chu ka ko a, Anih, ka Pathien chu ka ko hlak. Chun, ama chun a biekina inthawk chun ka râwl chu a hriet a, Chun, ka khêkri chu a naa chun a lût tah a."
"Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.","Chu phingle chun hnuoi hi ân hning a, ân thin tah a, A lunginsen leiin vân innghatna chenin ân hnîngin ân thin tah a."
"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.","A hnâra inthawk chun meikhu ân tung ta ngut ngut a, A baua suok mei chun a kâng ta dur dur a; Chu chun meihawl khawm chu a sukchawk ta dur dur a."
"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.","Ama chun vânhai khawm a sukkûn a, a ṭum tah a, A ke hnuoiahai chun inthim sâmup hi a hung um a."
"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.","Cherub chungah a chuong a, a vuong tah a, Anih, thli thlaahai chun an hmuh a."
"And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.","Inthim chu ama inhuol vêlna bûktêah a siem a, Tuihai, vâna sûm sâmuphai chu fâwkkhâwmin,"
At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.,"A hmaa varna lei chun, Meilinghai chu a chawk a."
"Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.","LALPA chu vâna khin a hung inri dur dur a, Achunghnungtak chun a râwl ân suoh a."
"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.","Chun, thalhai chu a kâp suok a, anni chu a sukdar a, Kâwl dâm ân leptir a, a sukbuoi tah a."
"Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.","Chu phingleh LALPA kâwkna leia, A hnâra inthuok suokin a mût rak lei chun, Leihnuoi innghatnahai chu suklangin a um tah a."
"He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;","Ama chun chung tienga inthawkin a hung ban a, a mi chel a, Tui tamtaka inthawk chun a mi hnûk dawk a."
"He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.","A mi dotu hrâttaka inthawk chun a mi sanhim a, A mi theidatuhaia inthawk leh, keia ta ding chun an hrât talaw sih a."
They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.,"Anni chun ka vângsiet ni chun an mi hung thawh a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu kân nghatna tak a nih."
"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.","Ama chun hmun inthâwltakah a mi ṭhuoi suok a, Ka chunga a lâwm leiin a mi lo sanhim tah a nih."
Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.,"LALPA chun ka felzie ang peiin ka chungah a thawh a, Ka kuthai ân thieng ang ngeiin a mi thung a nih."
"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.","LALPA lampuihai chu ka hrawh a, Ka Pathien kuoma inthawk chun suoltakin ka fe hmang ngai si nawh a."
"For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.","A rorêlna po po ka hmaah a um hlak a, A thuruothai hlak chu ka nghatsan ngai si nawh a."
I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity.,"Ama kuoma chun hrilsietbo ka ni bawk a, Ka rîtlonaa inthawkin kân siekieng hlak a."
"Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun ka felzie ang peiin a mi lo thung tah a; A mithmua kân thiengzie ang peiin."
With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;,"Mi lunginsiet theihai kuoma chun lunginsiet theitakin insuklang i ta, Mi ṭha famkimhai kuoma chun ṭha famkimin insuklang i tih."
With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.,"Mi inthieng kuoma chun inthiengin insuklang i ta, Chun, mi kâwmaw kuoma chun kâwmaw angin insuklang i tih."
"And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.","Rinum tuor mihai chu sandam i ta, Mi chapohai ruok chu i suktlâwm theina dingin an chungah i mit a fu zing a."
"For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.","Aw LALPA, khâwnvar i ni sih a; LALPA chun kân thimna hi sukvar a tih."
For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.,"Nangma ṭhangpuiin râl ka baw sih a, Ka Pathien ṭhangpui bawkin kul kân châwmhlên a nih."
"As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.","Pathien chu a lampui a ṭha famkim a, LALPA thu chu inchien a ni tah. Ama ringtuhai po po ta dingin ama chu phaw a nih."
"For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?",LALPA naw chu tu am Pathien an um? Ei Pathien naw chu tu am lungpui an um a?
God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way.,"Pathien chu ka kulpui nghettak a na, Mi ṭha famkim chu a lampuiah a ṭhuoi hlak."
"He maketh his feet like hinds’ feet, And setteth me upon my high places.","Ka kehai chu sazukpui ke angin a siem a, Ka hmun insângahai a mîn umtir hlak."
"He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.","Ka kuthai hi râl kâp dingin ân chûktir hlak a, Chuongchun, ka bânhai hin dâr thalngul a kuoi zo hiel a."
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great.,Nangin i sandamna phaw chu i mi pêk bawk a; I înngaitlâwmna chun i mi siem lien tah.
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.,"Ka hnuoia ka kalchawina chu i suklien a, Chuongchun, ka kehai hi ân tleu nawh a."
"I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.","Ka hmêlmahai chu ka hnawt phâk a,ka sukbohmang a, Sukbohmang dêra an um hmakhat chun ka kîr nawh."
"And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet.","An tho nâwk thei nawna dingin ka sukbohmang dêr a, ka sât fik a; Anih, ka ke hnuoiah an tlu tah a."
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.,"Nangin inthawnaa ding chun ka taiah hrâtnain i mi hrên sih a, A mi hung thawtuhai chu ka hnuoiah i tukdawl tah a."
"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.","A mi theidatuhai chu ka sukbohmang theina dingin, Nangin a mi dotuhai chu mi hnunginnghatin în umtir ta bawk a."
"They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.","An ngha vêl a, nisienlakhawm, sandamtu ding tukhawm an um nawh a; LALPA ngei chu an hang en a, nisienlakhawm, a dawn si nawh."
"Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.","Chu phingle chun hnuoia pilvut ang elin ka vuok phit a, Khawlai chirhak ang elin ka sukhmât a, ka sukdar tah a."
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.,"Nangin ka mihai insuolnaa inthawk khawmin i mi sanhim tah a, Hnam tin lu chu ni dingin i mi vawng ṭha a. Ka hriet ngai naw hnam chun ka rawng bâwl tâng an tih."
"The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.","Hnam danghai chu ka kuomah inpêng an ta, Ka chanchin an hriet phingleh ka thu zâwm an tih."
"The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.","Hnam danghai chu chul an ta, An kulbînghaia inthawk dâm chun inthin pumin hung suok an tih."
"Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,","LALPA chu a hring zing a, ka lungpui chu inpâkin um raw se; A mi sandamna lungpui, Pathien chu chawimawiin um raw se."
"Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,","Phuba mi lapêktu le, Hnam tin ka hnuoia tukdawltu Pathien ngei chu."
"And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.","A mi dotuhaia inthawka a mi la suoktu, Anih, nangin a mi thawtuhai chungtieng chun i mi dawm kâng a; Mi nunsiea inthawk chun i mi sanhim hlak."
"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA, hnam tinhai lai chun lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, I hming inpâkin hla sak bawk ka tih."
"Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.","Ama chun sandamna ropuitak a lal a pêk hlak a; A hrieknâl chungah, David le a thlahai chung ngeia chun, Kumkhuoin a zainêmzie inlangtir a tih,” a tih a."
"Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised on high saith, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel:","Hieng hi David thuhril nuhnung tak a nih, Jesai naupa David chun a hril a; “Insângtaka dawm sânga, Jakob Pathien hrieknâl, Israelhai hla mawitak phuoktu chun a hril a;"
"The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me, And his word was upon my tongue.","LALPA thlarau chun keima mi hmangin a hril a, A thu chu ka leiah a um a."
"The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, That ruleth in the fear of God,","Israelhai Pathien chun a hril a, Israelhai lungpui chun: ‘Mi chunga feltaka rorêl hlaka, Pathien ṭi puma rorêl hlak chu,"
"He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springeth out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.","Nisa a hung suok a, sûm um dêr lo, Zîng khawvar ang hi nîng a ta; Raw sûr zoa khuo hung inthienga, Hnuoia hlohna inder no hlap ang hi nîng a tih."
"Verily my house is not so with God; Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things, and sure: For it is all my salvation, and all my desire, Although he maketh it not to grow.","Ei sûngkuo chu Pathien kuoma inthawk a ni naw am a nih? Chatuon thuthlung ka kuomah a thlung a; Iengkim fel le suknghet tlatin; Ka sandamna kim le duthusâm kim, Ân der suoktir naw ding maw?"
"But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with the hand;","Mi rilohai chu an rênga a hnâwla hnâwlhmang mi, hling ang nîng an ta, Kuta lâk mi an ni si nawh."
But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear: And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.,"A tâwktu ding chun thîr le fei ngul ruoi lem ding a na, Chuongchun, an hmuna raw- hmang vawng nîng an tih,’ tiin a mi biek a,” tiin."
"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.","Hieng hi David sipai huoisenhai hming chu a nih; Takemon mi Joseb-bassebeth chu sipai hotuhai laia hotu tak a na, ama chu ṭum khata mi za riet thattu Aznit mi Adino an ti bawk kha a nih."
"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.","Chun, a dawttu chu Aho mi naupa Dodai naupa Eleazar a na, ama chu Philistin mihai indo dinga an pungkhâwm a, an cho a, Israel mihai an fe hmang vawng laia David kuoma sipai huoisen pathumhai laia pakhat kha a nih."
"He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.","Ama chu a tho a, Philistin mihai chu kut kham rak khawpin, a kâwlhnâm khawm inlet theilo rak khawpin a that a, chu ni chun LALPAIN nasatakin a ngampêk a; chun, mipuihai chu a hnungah râllâk thil la ding ngawtin an hung kîr nâwk a."
"And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.","Chun, chu dawttu chu Hara mi, Agee naupa Samma a na. Dailuo umna hmunah Philistin mihai chu lâk tumin an inkhâwm a, chun, mipuihai chun Philistin mihai chu an tlânsiet san a."
"But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great victory.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu chu hmuna chun a ngîr a, a vêng tlat a, Philistin mihai chu a that a, chun, LALPAIN nasatakin a ngampêk a."
"And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.","Chun, sipai huoi sâwmthum laia pathumhai chu an zu feh a; bu sîk lai takin David kuomah Adullam pûkah an feh a; chun, Philistin sipai- hai chun Rephaim kâwnah ṭhang- hmun an khuor a."
And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.,"Chuong lai chun David chu kulbîngah a um a, chuong lai bawk chun Philistin sipaihai chu Bethle- hemah an um a."
"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!","Chun, David chun tui a châk êm êm el a, “Bethlehema tuisunsuo tui, kul kawtkhâr kâwla mi kha dâwn dinga mi pe um ta ve hai sienla aw,” a ta."
"And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.","Chuongchun, sipai huoisen pathumhai chun, Philistin sipaihai chu an nêr thleng a, kul kawtkhâr kâwla mi, Bethlehema tuisunsuo chu an va thâl a; an chawi a, David kuomah an fepui a, nisienlakhawm, a lo dâwn nuom nawh a, LALPA ta dingin a bunthlâk ta lem a."
"And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.","“Aw LALPA, hi hi ka thaw naw dingzie chu, thi huoma fehai thisen chu ka dâwn ding am a nih?” a ta; chuongchun, a dâwn nuom ta nawh a. Chuong thilhai chu sipai huoisen pathumhai chun an thaw a nih."
"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.","Zeruia naupa Joab unaupa Abisai chu sâwmthumhai laia hotu tak a na, ama chun za thumhai chunga chun a fei chu a phawi a, anni chu a that a, Pathumhai laia chun hming ṭhat a hlaw a."
Was he not most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.,"Sâwmthumhai laia chun chawimawi tlâk tak a ni naw am a nih? Chuleiin, an hotuah an siem a, nisienlakhawm, a chunghnung tak pathum laia tiemsa a kai nawh."
"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.","Chun, Kabzeel mi huoi naupa Jehoiada naupa Benaia thil nasatak thawtu chun Moab mi Ariel naupasal pahnihai chu a that a; chun, a zu feh a, vûr tlâk hun laiin khursûngah sakeibaknei a zu that bawk a."
"And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.","Chun, Aigupta mi, mi lientak a that a; Aigupta mi chun a fei a chawi a, nisienlakhawm, ama chun hmawl chawiin a zuk pan a, Aigupta mi fei chawi chu a lâkpêk a, ama fei ma chun a sun hlum tah a."
"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.",Jehoiada naupa Benaia chun chuong ang thil chu a thaw leiin sipai huoisen pathumhai laia chun hming- ṭhat a hlawh a.
"He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.","Mi sâwmthumhai nêk chun chawimawi tlâk a ni hrim a, nisienla- khawm, achunghnung tak pathum- hai laia tiemsa a kai nawh. Chun, David chun ama vêngtu hotuah a sieh a."
"Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,","Joab unaupa Asahel chu sâwmthumhai laia pakhat chu a na; Bethlehem khuoa mi Dodo naupa Elhanan,"

"And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.","Chun, LALPA lunginsenna chu Israelhai chungah a ṭuong nawk ta thut a, “Fe la, Israel mihai le Juda mihai tiem vawng rawh,” tiin David chun an pawi tâwk dingin a chawktho a."
"And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.","Chun, lal chun a kuoma um sipai hotu Joab kuoma chun, “Israel hnam po po lai hin Dana inthawka Beer- Seba chenin invâk vêl la mi ieng zât am an ni ka hriet theina dingin tiem vawng ro,” a ta."
"And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?","Chun, Joab chun lal kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chun mipuihai sukpungin, ieng zâta tam khawm, a lêt za khawm, lalpa ka pu a hin hmu hman raw se; nisienlakhawm, lalpa ka pu chun chu chu iengdinga hriet ân hâwk am a ni leh?” a ta."
"Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, lal thu chun Joab le a sipai hotuhai chu a hne tah a. Chuongchun, Joab le a sipai hotu- hai chu Israelhai tiem ding chun lal kuoma inthawk chu an suok tah a."
"And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:","Chun, Jordan râl an va kai a, chun, Gad ruom laitak changtieng panga khaw um Aroera chun Jazer chenin umhmun an khuor a;"
"then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,","chun, Tahtim-hodsi le Gilead ram an tlung a; chun, Dan-jaan an tlung a, Zidon panin an fe pei a,"
"and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.","chun, Tura kul dâm an va tlung a; chun, Hiv mihai le Kanaan mihai khuohai po po an tlung a, chun, Judai simtieng Beer-sebaah an feh a."
"So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.","Chuongchun, ram po po chu an fang suok hnung chun, thla kuo le ni sâwmhni zoah Jerusalemah an fe nâwk tah a."
And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.,"Chun, Joab chun mihriem zât chin chu lal a pêk a; chun, Israel rama chun kâwlhnâm chawi mi, mi huoisen nuoi riet an um a; chun, Juda mi chu nuoi nga an um a."
"And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.","Chun, mihriem an hang tiem zo chun David lungril chu a na ta hle el a.

"And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,","Chun, zîngkâra David a hang tho chun David zâwlnei, zâwlnei Gad kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a,"
"Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.","“Fe la, David kuomah, ‘LALPA- IN hieng ang hin a tih; thil kawng thum ka ruotpêk cheh a, i chunga ka thaw dingin pakhat thlang rawh,’ a tih a,” tiin."
"So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.","Chuongchun, Gad chu David kuomah a feh a, a kuomah, “I rama hin kum sari ṭâm hung tlâk am, i hmêlma hmaa an hnawt sûng cheh a, thla thum lo tlân hmang hri am, i rama ni thum hri hung inlêng? a mi tirtu ieng angin am ka dawn ding a na, inngaituo la, mi hril raw khai,” a ta."
"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.","Chun, David chun Gad kuom- ah, “Ka lunginzîng hle el a, LALPA kutah tlulût phawt el lang; a zângaina chu a nasa hle sih a; mihriem kuta chen chu mîn tlûklûttir naw hram rawh,” a ta."
So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.,"Chuongchun, LALPA chun Israel mihai lai chun zîngkâra in- thawkin hun ruot ang chen chu hri ân lêngtir a, chuongchun, mipuihai laia mi chu Dana inthawka Beer-Seba chenah mi sîng sari an thih a."
"And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.","Chun, vântirkoin sukse dinga Jerusalem tienga a kut a hang inlet chun LALPAIN thil ṭha naw thaw a tum chu ân lêt a, mihai sukbo- hmangtu vântirko kuoma chun, “A hun tah ie, i kut inlet ta naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, LALPA vântirko chu Jebus mi Arauna hrizâwl bula chun a um a."
"And David spake unto Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.","Chun, Davidin mi sukhlumtu vântirko a hmu chun LALPA a biek a, “Ngai ta, ka lo suol tah a, indik nawtakin thil ka lo thaw tah a nih; nisienlakhawm, hieng berâmhai hin ieng thil am an thawh a?

"And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.","Chun, chu ni chun Gad chu David kuomah a feh a, a kuomah, “Hang fe la, Jebus mi Arauna hrizâwlah LALPA ta dingin mâichâm hang siem rawh,” a ta."
"And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.","Chun, David chu LALPAIN thu a pêk anga, Gadin a hril ang chun a hang fe tah a."
"And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.","Chun, Arauna chu a hei ngha a, ama tieng pana lal le a rawihai hung chu a hmuh a, chuongchun, Arauna chu a suok a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin lal hmaa chun a bawkkhup a."
"And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.","Chun, Arauna chun, “Iengdinga ka pu lal chu a siehlaw kuoma hi hung am a nih a?” a ta. Chun, David chun, “Mipuihai laia inthawka hri hi ân kieng theina dingin LALPA ta dinga mâichâm siemna dinga i hrizâwl hi inchaw dingin,” a ta."
"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:","Chun, Arauna chun David kuomah, “Lalpa ka pu chun âwm a ti chu la sienla, inhlân raw se, en ta, pumrawhmanga inhlân dingin bâwngchalhai chu an um a; chun, thing dingin hrizâwl hmangruohai le sebâwng thuomhnawhai chu a um bawk a."
"all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.","Aw, lalpa, hieng po po hi Arauna chun lal a pêk vawng a nih,” a ta. Chun, Arauna chun lal kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chun hung dawn raw se che,” a ta."
"And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.","Chun, lal chun Arauna kuomah, “Ni lo e, a man neiin ân châwk ngeiin inchawpêk lem ka ti che, iengkhawm insêng loin LALPA ka Pathien kuom- ah pumrawhmang thilinhlân inhlân naw tawp ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chun hrizâwl le sebâwngchal- hai chu tangka shekel sâwmngain ân châwk tah a."
"And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.","Chun, David chun chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le inremna thilinhlânhai ân hlân a.

"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.","Saula sûnghai le David sûnghai chu sâwttak an indo a, David chu a hung hrât tiel tiel a, Saula sûnghai ruok chu an hung hrât naw tiel tiel tah a."
"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;","Chun, David chun Hebron khuoa chun naupasalhai a nei a, a naupa hmasa tak chu Ammon, Jezreel mi Ahinoam le an inkâra mi a nih;"

"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.","Chun, Saula sûnghai le David sûnghai chu an indo lai chun, Abner chu Saula sûnghai laia chun ân sukhrât ta deu deu a."
"Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?","Saula chun hmei a nei a, a hming chu Rizpa, Aia naunu a nih. Chun, Is-boseth chun Abner kuomah, “Ieng- dinga ka pa hmeinu kuomah i fe am?” a ta."
"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.","Chuongchun, Is-boseth thuhril chun Abner chu a suklungsen ta êm êm el a, “Judahai ui lu el am ka nih?

"God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;","LALPAIN a kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm ta anga David ta dinga ka thaw naw chun Abner chu a law law law el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin."
"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.","Saula sûnghaia inthawka ram chu lâkpêk a, Israel le Judahai chungah Dana inthawka Beer-seba chena David lalṭhungpha tungding dinga ka va thaw naw chun,” a ta."
"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.","Chuongchun, a ṭi êm leiin Abner chu a dawn khawm a dawn ngam ta nawh a."
"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.","Chun, Abner chun ama aiawin David kuoma chun, “Hi ram hi tu ta am a nih a?” tiin mitirhai a tir a; chun, “Ka kuomah thu thlung rawh, chuongchun, ngai ta, Israel mi po po i kuom tienga ṭhang dingin ka kut chu nangma tieng ṭhang a tih,” tiin a hril nâwk a."
"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.","Chun, ama chun, “Aw le, i kuoma chun thu thlung ka tih, ami- ruokchu, nangma kuomah thil pakhat ka phût ding a nih, chu chu hi hi a nih; mi hmu dinga i hung phaleh Saula naunu Mikal kha i hung ṭhuoi phawt naw chun ka hmêl hmu thei naw ti nih,” a ta."
"And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.","Chun, David chun Saula naupa Is-boseth kuoma chun, “Philistin mihai ser vun za khata kân châwk ka nuhmei Mikal chu mi hung pe rawh,” tiin mihai a tir a."
"And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.","Chun, Is-boseth chun mi a tir a, a pasal La-is naupa Paltiel kuom ngeia inthawk chun an ṭhuoi tah a."
"And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.","Chun, a pasal chu a kuoma chun a feh a, ṭap malam peiin a feh a, Bahurim chenin a zui a. Chuongchun, Abner chun a kuomah, “Fe rawh, kîr nâwk el rawh,” a tih a, chun, a kîr nâwk tah a."
"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:","Chuongchun, Abner chun Israel mihai upahai chu a biek a, “Kha hma khan David chu in chunga lala um dingin in dit hlak a;"
"now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.","tuhin siem ta ro khai LALPAIN David chungchâng thua chun, ‘Ka siehlaw David kutin ka mi Israelhai chu Philistin mihai kuta inthawk le, an hmêlmahai po po kuta inthawkin sansuok ka tih,’ tiin a hril a nih,” tiin."
"And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.","Chun, Abner chun Benjamin mihai na hrieta chun a hril bawk a; chun, Abner chu Israel mihai le Benjamin sûng po pohaiin ṭha an ti ang taphawt Hebrona David na hrieta hril dingin a fe bawk a."
"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.","Chuongchun, Abner chu Hebrona David kuoma chun mi sâwmhni leh an feh a. Chun, David chun Abner le a kuoma mi sâwm- hnihai ta ding chun ruoi a ṭheh a."
"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.","Abner chun David kuoma chun, “Tho ka ta, i kuoma thu an thlung theina ding le, i duthusâm angtaka ro i rêl theina dingin Israel mi po pohai ka lalpa kuoma hin hung kei khâwm dingin fêng ka tih,” a ta. Chun, David chun Abner chu ân fetir a, chuong- chun, lungmuongtak chun a fe tah a."
"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.","Chun, ngai ta, David mihai le Joab mihai rammu chu an hung a, râllâk tamtak an hung lâk a, nisienlakhawm, Abner chu Hebrona David kuoma chun a lo um ta nawh a; a lo infetir ta sih a, ama khawm chu lungmuongtakin a lo fe tah a nih."
"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.","Joab le a kuoma mipui po po an hung tlung chun, “Nera naupa Abner chu lal kuomah a hung a, ama chun a lo infetir nâwk tah a, lungmuong- takin a fe nâwk tah,” tiin Joab chu an hril a."
"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?","Chuongchun, Joab chu lal kuoma chun a feh a, “I thil lo thaw hi iengtizie am a ni leh? Ngai ta, Abner chu i kuomah a hung a, iengdinga în fetir a, a fe dai el am a ni ta leh?"
"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.","Nera naupa Abner chu i hriet a, i suok i lût le i thilthaw iengkim hriet tuma hung a na,” a ta."
"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.","Chun, David kuoma inthawka Joab a hung suok chun Abner hnawt ding chun mi a tir a, Sira tuisunsuoa inthawkin an hung ṭhuoikîr a, nisien- lakhawm, David chun a hriet nawh."
"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.","Chun, Abner chun Hebron a hung tlung chun Joab chun kul kawt- khârah biekrûk dingin a ṭhuoi hran a, a unau Asahel thisen suok thungna dingin a phîngah a sun hlum tah a."
"And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:","Chun, a nakiea Davidin a hung hriet chun, “Nera naupa Abner thisen insuo thua hin kei le ka ram chu LALPA mithmuin inthieng kum- khuong kan ta,"
"let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.","Joab lu chungah tla sienla, a pa sûnghai po po chunga leh; Joab sûng- haia inthawka thil pût amanih, phâr amanih, hmawl ringsana um mi amanih, kâwlhnâma thi amanih, ṭâm amanih hung um loin um naw raw se,” a ta."
"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.","Chuongchun, an unaupa Asahel chu Gibeona indonaa a that leiin Joab le a unau Abisai chun Abner chu an that tah a."
"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.","Chun, David chun Joab le a kuoma mipui po pohai kuoma chun, “In puonhai chu keithlêr unla, saiip puon sil unla, Abner chu sûn ro,” a ta. Chun, lal David chun hlâng chu a zui a."
"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.","Chun, Abner chu Hebrona chun an phûm a, lal chun a râwl ân suoh a. Abner thlâna chun a ṭap tah a; mipui po po khawm an ṭap a."
"And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?","Chun, lal chun Abner chu a ṭah a, “Abner chu invêt thiin a thi el ding a ni maw?"
"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.","I kut hai chu khuop a ni nawh a, i ke hai chu kawl inbun a ni bawk nawh, Mi rilo nauhai hmaa mi a tlûk anga i tlûk el ta chu?” a ta. Chun, mi po po chun ama an ṭa nâwk a."
"And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.","Chuongchun, sûn a la ni laiin David chu bu infâktir dingin mi po po chu an hung a; nisienlakhawm, David chun, “Nisa tlâk hmaa bu amanih thil dang amani khawm a fâka ka fâk vai chun Pathien chun a law law mi law raw se, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” tiin ṭawng ân khâm a."
"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.","Chu chu mi po poin an hriet chun an lâwm êm êm a, lal thilthaw taphawthai chun mipuihai po po chu a suklâwm pei a."
So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.,"Chuongchun, mipui po po le Israel mi po pohai chun Nera naupa Abner thata um chu lal thu a ni nawh ti an hriet tah a."
"And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?","Chun, lal chun a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Vawisûn hin Israel mi lien, mi ropuitak a thi ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.","Lal dinga hrieknâl ni lang khawm, vawisûn hin ka hrât naw a nih; chun, hieng Zeruia nauhai hi ka ta dingin tuor hla an um taluo a nih; LALPAIN thil ṭha naw thawtu chu a suolzie ang peiin thung raw se,” a ta."
"And when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.","Saula naupa Is-boseth chun Hebronah Abner chu a thi ti a lo hriet chun a kuthai a hung hrât ta nawh a, chun, Israel mi po pohai chu an ṭi tah a."
"And Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:","Chun, Saula naupa Is-boseth chun sipai pâwl hotu pahni a nei a; pakhat hming chu Baanah a na, a dang hming chu Rekab a nih, Benjamin thla Beeroth mi Rimmon naupasalhai an nih; (Beeroth chu Benjamin rama ngai a ni sih a;"
"and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).","Beeroth khuoa mihai chu Gittaim-ah an tlân a, tu chen hin chutaka chun an um tah a)."
"Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.","Saula naupa Jonathan chun naupa ke inbai a nei a, Jezreela inthawka Saula le Jonathan chan- chin an lo hriet chun kum nga mi a na; a dawntunu chun a pawm a, a tlânhmangpui tah a; chun, tlân- hmangpui dinga ân hmâwna kârah ân thlâk a, a ke a hung inbai tah a. A hming chu Mephiboseth a nih."
"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.","Chun, Beeroth mi Rimmon nau- pahai Rekab le Baana chu an feh a; Is-boseth ina chun, nisa inding lai- takin, a sûn châwl lai takin an feh a."
"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.","Bu la ni âwmtakin insûng ril tieng chun an lût a, a phîngah an va sun a; chun, Rekab le a unaupa Baana chu an tlânhmang tah a."
"Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.","Chun, inah an va lût a, a zâlna pindana khuma zâl chu an sun a, an that a, a lu an tan a, a lu chu an lâk a, Araba lampui tieng fe thlengin zânkhawvârin an feh a."
"And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.","Chun, Is-boseth lu chu Hebrona chun David kuomah an hung lâk a, lal kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, hi nanga that tumtu, i hmêlma Saula naupa Is-boseth lu, LALPA chun kan lalpa phuba vawisûn hin Saula le a thlaa inthawkin a lâkpêk ta a ni hi,” an ta."
"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,","Chun, David chun Beeroth mi Rimmon naupa Rekab le a unaupa chu a dawn a, an kuomah, “LALPA ka lunginzîngna po poa mi sandamtu hringna sâlin ka hril a nih;"
"when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.","chanchin ṭha hung tluna inngaiin ‘Ngai ta, Saula chu a thi tah,’ tiin mi pakhatin a mi hung hril a, ama chu ka man a, Ziklaga chun ka that a; chu chu a chanchin ṭha hung intlun mana ka lo pêk chu a nih."
"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?","Mi fel ama insûng luma, a khumlaizâwl ngeia mi, mi suolin an that a thisen man chu nangnia in- thawk hin ka phût nâwk zuolin, hnuoia inthawk hin ka va sukbo- hmang âwm ngei cheu deh aw,” a ta."
"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.","Chuongchun, David chun a tlangvâlhai chu thu a pêk a, anni chun an that a, an kut le an kehai an tanpêk a, Hebrona dîl panga chun an khai a, Is-boseth lu ruok chu an lâk a, Hebrona Abner thlâna chun an phûm tah a."
"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.","Chuongchun, Israel chihai po po chu Hebrona David kuomah an hung a, “Ngai ta, i ru le i tisahai kan na."
"In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.","Kha hmaa Saula kan chunga ân lal laia Israelhai ṭhuoi suok le ṭhuoi lûttu i ni hlak a; chun, LALPA chun i kuomah, ‘Ka mi Israelhai chu châwm i ta, Israelhai chungah hotuin um i tih,’ a tih a,” an ta."
So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.,"Chuongchun, Israel upahai po po chu Hebrona chun lal kuomah an va feh a; chun, lal David chun Hebrona chun LALPA hmaah an kuomah thu a thlung a, chun, David chu Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek an nâl a."
"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.","David chu ân lal tîr lai chun kum sâwmthum mi a na, kum sâwmli sûng ân lal a."
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.,"Hebrona chun Judahai chungah kum sari le thla ruk ân lal a; chun, Jerusalemah Israelhai le Judahai po po chungah kum sâwmthum le kum thum ân lal a."
"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.","Chun, lal le a mihai chu chu rama chêng Jebus mihai chu rûn dingin Jerusalemah an feh a; chuonghai chun David a hung lût thei naw ringin David kuomah, “Hitaka hin hung lût naw tawp i tih, mitdel le kebaihaiin lo dang an ti che,” an ta."
Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.,"Nisienlakhawm, David chun Zion kul chu a lâk a, chu chu David khuo chu a nih."
"And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and smite the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.","Chun, David chun chu ni chun, “Jebus mihai thawtu taphawt chu tuiluongnaah hang fe hai sienla, David theidatu mitdel le kebai chu that raw hai se,” a ta. Chuongchun, “Mitdel le kebai chu ina chun lût naw nihai,” an ti hlak a."
"And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.","Chun, David chu kula chun a um a, David khuo tiin ân bûk tah a. Chun, David chun Milloa inthawkin a vêlin kul a siem a, a sûngtieng leh."
"And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.","Chuongchun, David chu a hung ropui ta deu deu a, LALPA, sipaihai Pathien chu a kuoma a um pei leiin."
"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.","Chun, Tura lal Hiram chun David kuomah mi a tir a, sidar thinghai a thawn a, themthiemhai le lung suttuhai a tir bawk a, David ta ding chun in an bâwlpêk a."
"And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.","Chun, David chun LALPAIN Israelhai chungah lalah ama chu a sukdet a, a mi Israelhai leiin a ram chu a chawimawi a nih ti a hriet tah a."
"And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.","Chun, David chun Hebron a suoksan hnungin Jerusalema chun thaikêm le nuhmei a nei belsah a; chuongchun, David chun naupasal- hai le naunuhmeihai a la nei sa ta rawp a."
"And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,","Chun, Jerusalema a neihai hming chu hieng hi an nih; Sammua, Sobab, Nathan, Solomon,"
"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,","Ibhar, Elisua, Nepheg, Japhia,"
"and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.","Elisama, Eliada, le Eliphelet hai hi an nih."
"And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.",Philistin mihai chun David chu Israelhaiin lala um dingin hriek an nâl ti an hrietin Philistin mihai po po chu David zawng ding chun an hang fe tah a; David chun chu chu a lo hrietin a kulbînga chun a feh a.
Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.,"Chun, Philistin mihai chu an hung a, Rephaim ruoma chun an inzar a."
"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.","Chun, David chun, “Philistin mihai thaw dingin kan hang fe ding am a nih? ka kuta hin anni chu pêng i ti?” tiin LALPA a rawn a. LALPA chun David kuoma chun, “Hang fe rawh, Philistin mihai chu i kutah ka pêk ngei ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
"And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.","Chuongchun, David chu Baal- perazima chun a feh a, chutaka chun David chun anni chu a hneh a, “LALPAIN ka hmêlmahai chu tuiting inṭhe ang elin ka hmaah a mi sukdarpêk tah,” a ta. Chuleiin, chu hmun hming ding chun Baal-perazim ân bûk a."
And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.,"Chutaka chun Philistin mihai chun an milimhai an mâksan a, David le a mihai chun an lâk a."
"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu an hang fe nâwk a, Rephaim ruoma chun an inzar nâwk a."
"And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.","Chun, Davidin LALPA a hang rawn chun, ama chun, “Hang fe naw rawh, an hnungtieng fe huol la, thingtheihmi kûng zâwna khin hang thaw rawh."
"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.","Chun, thingtheihmi kûng lêra fe ri ṭhup ṭhup ang i hriet pha chun châng rawh, Philistin sipaihai thaw dingin i hmaah LALPA a suok tah tina nîng a tih,” a ta."
"And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN thu a pêk angin David chun a thawh a, Philistin mihai chu Gebaa inthawka Gezer chenin a that a."
"And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.",David chun Israel mihai laia thlang ṭhieu mi sîng thum ân khâwm nâwk a.
"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth above the cherubim.","Chun, David chu a tho a, Juda rama Baala khuoa inthawkin cherub- hai chunga chuong sipaihai LALPA hming an inputtir Pathien bâwm chu zu la dingin a kuoma mi um po pohai le chun an inthawk tah a."
"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu taw- lailîr tharah an sieh a, tlânga um Abinadab ina inthawk chun an lâk suok a, Abinadab naupasalhai Uzza le Ahio chun tawlailîr thar chu an khal a."
"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.","Chun, tlânga Abinadab ina inthawk chun, Pathien bâwm pum chun an lâk suok a; Ahio chu Pathien bâwm hma tieng chun a feh a."
"And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of instruments made of fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.","Chun, David le Israel mi po pohai chun LALPA hmaah thil inri thei chi hran hran fâr thinga siem le, ṭing- ṭanghai dâm, perkhuonghai dâm, khuongtêhai dâm, tawtawrâwt bi neihai dâm, dârbenthekhai dâm an sut a."
"And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.","Chun, Nakon hrizâwl an tlung chun Uzza chun Pathien bâwm chu a hei ban a, a chel a; sebâwng chu a pêm a pêm leiin."
And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.,"Chun, LALPA lung chu Uzza chunga chun a sen ta thut a, a thil- thaw indik naw lei chun Pathienin chutaka chun a sukhlum tah a; Pathien bâwm kâwla chun a thi tah a."
"And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.","Chun, LALPA chu Uzza chunga a hung ṭuong ta lei chun David chu a lunginsen a, chu hmun chu Perez- uzza ân bûk a; chu chu tu chen hin a la ni ta zing a."
"And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?","Chu ni chun David chun LALPA chu a ṭih a, “Iengtin am LALPA bâwm hi ka kuom hung tlung thei a ta aw?” a ta."
So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.,"Chuongchun, David chun David khuoa chun LALPA bâwm chu a kuomah a lâk nuom ta nawh a, David chun Git mi Obed-edom ina chun a sie ta lem a."
"And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu Git mi Obed-edom ina chun thla thum a um a, chuongchun, Obed-edom le a sûng- hai po po chu LALPAIN mal a sâwm a."
"And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.","Chun, lal David chu, “Pathien bâwm leiin Obed-edom sûngkuo le a in le lo po po LALPAIN mal a sâwm a nih,” ti an hril a. Chuongchun, David chun Pathien bâwm chu Obed-edom ina inthawk chun David khuoa chun lâwmtakin a zu lâk tah a."
"And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.","Chun, LALPA bâwm zâwntuhai chu pên ruk an fe phingleh se- bâwngchal le ran châwm thâuin an inthâwi a."
And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.,"Chun, David chu a theitâwpin LALPA hmaah a lâm a, David chun puonzaiinhmi thiempu zakawsîng a hâk a."
"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.","Chuongchun, David le Israel mi po pohai chun khêk dur dur pum le tawtawrâwt mût ruoi ruoi pumin LALPA bâwm chu an lâk tah a."
"And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu David khuoa a lût lai chun Saula naunu Mikal chun tukvera inthawk hin a lo thlîr a; LALPA hmaa David lâm le inchâwm chu a zuk hmuh a, a hmusit lungril tah a."
"And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, LALPA bâwm chu an lâk lût a, a siena dinga Davidin a zar, puon in sûnga a hmun dinga chun an sie tah a; chun, David chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thilinhlân chu LALPA hmaa chun ân hlân a."
"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, Davidin pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thil inhlânhai ân hlân zo chun, sipaihai LALPA hmingin mipuihai chu mal a sâwm a."
"And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.","Chun, mipui po po, Israel mi pumpuihai chu a nuhmei a pasalin mi tin el chu bei hlawm khat le sa tlin khat le grêp ra emṭâwl bâwr khat a sem seng a. Chuongchun, mi po po chu mâni in tieng an fe ta seng a."
"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!","Chuongchun, David chu a sûnghai malsâwm dingin a fe tah a.

"And David said unto Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.","David chun Mikal kuoma chun, “I pa le a sûnghai po po aiah mi thlang a, LALPA mi Israelhai chunga lal dinga mi ruottu LALPA hmaah i sawnnaw, LALPA hmaa chu lâm âwm hrim ka nih."
"And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.","Hieng nêk hmanin inzapui la um ka tih, kei le kei khawm lân sit pei bawk ka ta; amiruokchu, chuong sie- hlaw nunghâkhai i hrilhai chawi- mawi chun um ka tih,” a ta."
And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.,"Chuongchun, Saula naunu Mikal chun a thi chenin nau a nei ta nawh a."
"And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,","Chun, lal chu a inah a um a, LALPAIN an vêla a hmêlmahai po poa inthawka râlmuonga ân umtir hnung chun,"
"that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.","lal chun zâwlnei Nathan kuom- ah, “Hi, kei chu sidar thing inah ka um a, Pathien bâwm ruok chu puon in elah a um a,” a tih a."
"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.","Chun, Nathan chun lal kuomah, “I lungrila a um ang tak chun va thaw rawh, LALPA i kuomah a um annâwm,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,","Chun, chu zân vêk chun Nathan kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a,"
"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?","“Fe la, ka siehlaw David chu va hril rawh, ‘LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ka umna dingin nangin in i mi bâwlpêk ding am a nih?"
"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.","Israel thlahai Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suoka inthawkin tu chen hin inah ka um ngai nawh a, puon ina le biekbûkah ka um pei lem hlak a."
"In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?","Israel thlahai lai po poah, ka fena taphawtahai khawm, ka mi Israelhai châwm dinga thu ka ipêk rorêltuhai kuomah, Iengdinga sidar thinga in i mi bâwlpêk naw am a na,’ tiin ka hril hlak am a nih?"
"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;","Chuleiin, ka siehlaw David kuomah, Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘berâm tlatna hmuna inthawka i berâm vêng lai chun ka mi Israelhai chunga hotu dingin ka lâk cheh a;"
"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.","chun, i fena taphawtah i kuomah ka um pei a, i hmaa chun i hmêlmahai ka sukbo pei a, hnuoia mi ropuitakhai hming ang hming ropuitak siempêk ka ti che."
"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,","Chun, ka mi Israelhai ta dingin hmun ruot ka ta, anni ngei puol hmuna an um a, an insawn ta nawna dingin anni chu phun ka ta, kha hma ang khan mi rilohaiin sukrimsi ta naw ni hai a;"
and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.,"ka mi Israelhai chunga rorêl- tuhai ka ruot lai ang kha ni bawk ta naw nih; chun, i hmêlmahai po poa inthawk hin inchâwltir ka ti che.

"When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.","I nihai a kina, i puhai kuoma i zâl pha chun, i hnunga i thla, i rîla ra ding chu tungding ka ta, a ram chu sukdet ka tih."
"He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.","Ama chun ka hming dingin in bâwl a ta; chun, a ram lalṭhungpha chu kumkhuoa dingin suknghet ka tih."
"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;","A pa nîng ka ta, ama chu ka naupa nîng a ta, thil a suksuol chun mihriem nauhai hmawl le mihriem nauhai vuoknain thunun ka ta;"
"but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.","nisienlakhawm, i hmaa ka sawnhmang Saula kuoma inthawka ka lâk hmang ang khan ka zangaina chun ama chu mâksan naw nih."
And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.,"Chun, i sûngkuo le i ram chu chatuona suknghet tlat nîng a ta, i lalṭhungpha chu chatuona suknghet nîng a tih,’ a tih,” tiin LALPA thu a hung tlung a."
"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.","Chuong thu po po ang le, chu inlârna ang chie chun Nathanin David kuoma chun a hril a."
"Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?","Chuongchun, lal David chu a lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a ṭhung a, “Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, tu am ka na, ka sûnghai tu am an na, hi chen chen hi i mi ṭhuoi?"
"And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!","Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, chuong khawm chu nanga mithmua chun thil chîn tham el chu a na, nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw sûngkuo hung umdân ding chu kum tamtak sûnga khan i lo hril ta bawk a, Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, hienghai khawm hi mihriemhai thaw dân ang bawk a na."
"And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.","David hin i kuomah ieng am hril nâwk chuong tâng a ta? I siehlaw hi i hriet vawng si, Aw Lalpa PATHIEN."
"For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.",I siehlaw hriet dingin i thu lei le nangma lungril ang peiin hieng thil ropuitak hi i thaw tah a.
"Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.","Chuleichun, Aw LALPA Pa- thien, nang chu i ropui a nih, kan naa kan hriet angin nanga ang hrim hrim an um nawh a, nangma naw chu Pathien hrim hrim an um bawk nawh."
"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?","Aigupta rama inthawk le hnam tin le an pathienhaia inthawka i ta dinga în tlansuok, i mihai hmaa i ta dinga thil ropuitak le i ram ta dinga thil ṭiumtak thaw ding le ama hming ropuitak siem dinga Pathienin ama mihai ni dinga a hung intlansuok i mi Israelhai ang hrim hrim hi khawvêla hin hnam dang tu am an um a?"
"And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.","Chuongchun, i mi Israelhai chu chatuona i mihai an ni theina dingin i ta dingin i suknghet tah a; chun, LALPA, nang chu an Pathien i hung ni tah a."
"And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.","Chuongchun, Aw LALPA Pa- thien, i siehlaw chungchâng thu le a sûnghai chungchâng thu i hril chu chatuona dingin suknghet la, i hril ta ang khan thaw rawh."
"And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.","Chun, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chu Israelhai Pathien a nih,’ tiin, i hming chu chatuona chawimawiin um raw se; chuongchun, i siehlaw David sûng- hai hi i hmaa suknghetin um an tih."
"For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.","Aw Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien, i siehlaw kuomah, ‘Sûngkuo chu inngîrpêk ka ti che,’ tiin i phuong ta sih a, chuleiin, i siehlaw hin hi ṭawngṭaina hi i kuomah ân tlun ngam a nih."
"And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:","Aw LALPA Pathien, Nang chu Pathien i na, i thu chu thutak a na; chun, hi thilṭha hi i siehlaw kuoma chun i tiem tah a;"

"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.","Chun, chu hnunga chun David chun Philistin mihai chu a thawh a, a hne tah a; chuongchun, David chun Philistin mihai thuneina khaw- pui chu a lâkpêk tah a."
"And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.","Chun, Moab mihai a thaw nâwk a, a hnuoiah ân zâltir a, inkhina hruiin ân khih a; tlar hni chu suk- hlum dingin ân khih a, tlar khat chu a tluona hring dingin ân khih a.

"David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.",David chun Euphrates vadunga a ram la dinga a fe malamin Zoba leh Rehob naupa Hadadezer chu a thawh a.
"And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.","Chuongchun, David chun a sakawr chung chuong mi sâng khat le za sari le sipai sîng hni a manpêk a; chun, David chun tawlailîr kei mi sakawrhai po po chu an thahrui a satpêk a, tawlailîr za hnûktu ding ruok chu a hlah a."
"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.","Chun, Damaskaa Suria mihai Zoba lal Hadadezer san dinga fehai chu David chun Suria mihai laia mi chu sîng hni le sâng hni a that a."
"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.","Chuongchun, David chun Suria rama Damaskaa chun sipaihai a sieh a; chuongchun, Suria mihai chu David siehlawhai an hung ni tah a, thilpêkhai an hung pêk hlak a.

"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.","Chun, David chun Hadadezer rawihai rângkachak phawhai chu a lâkpêk a, Jerusalem tieng a phur a."
"And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.","Chun, Hadadezer khuo Betaa inthawk dâm, Berothaia inthawk dâmin dâr tamtak a lâk a."
"And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,","Chun, Hamath lal Toi chun Hadadezer sipaihai po po David chun a hne ti a lo hriet a."
"then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:","Hadadezer chu a thawh a, a hne leiin chibai bûk dingin le lâwmpui dingin Toi chun a naupa Joram chu David kuomah a tir a, Hadadezer chun Toi hi a lo do hlak hrim a na.

"And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.","Chun, David chu Chi Ruoma, Suria mi sîng khat le sâng riet a thaw hung tieng chun a hming ân thang tah a."
"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.","Chun, Edoma chun râl vêng sipai a sieh a, Edom ram hmun tinah sipai a sie nghuon el a; chuongchun, Edom mihai po po chu David sie- hlawhai an hung ni tah a; chuong- chun, LALPAIN David chu a fena tieng taphawtah ân hnetir ta pei a."
And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.,"Chuongchun, David chun Israel mi po pohai chungah ro a rêl a; chun, David chun a mihai po po chunga chun feltakin ro a rêl a."
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;,"Chun, Zeruia naupa Joab chu sipai hotu tak a na; chun, Ahilud naupa Jehosaphat chu chanchin ziektu a nih;"
"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;","chun, Ahitub naupa Zadok le Abiathar naupa Ahimelek chu thiempu an nih; chun, Seraia chu ziektu a nih;"
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.,"chun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu Kereth mi le Peleth mihai hotu a nih; chun, David naupasalhai chu thiempu an nih."
"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?","Chun, David chun, “Jonathan leia lunginsietna kân langtir theina dingin Saula sûnghai laia mi um an la um am aw?” a ta."
"And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.","Chun, Saula sûnghai siehlaw pakhat a hming Ziba a um a, David kuoma fe dingin an ko a; chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ziba i ni maw?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ni e, kei i sie- hlawpa hi,” a ta."
"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.","Chun, lal chun, “Pathien lungin- sietna ka suklang theina dingin Saula sûnghai laia mi an la um naw am a nih?” a ta. Chun, Ziba chun, “Jonathan chun naupasal pakhat a la nei a, a kehai khawm ân bai nghe ngheh a,” a ta."
"And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ama chu khaw lai am a um a?” a ta. Chun, Ziba chun lal kuomah, “Lo-debarah, Ammiel naupa Makir inah a um,” a ta."
"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.","Chuongchun, lal David chun mi a tir a, Lo-debara inthawk, Ammiel naupa Makir ina mi chu an va ṭhuoi a."
"And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!","Chun, Saula nau Jonathan nau- pa Mephiboseth chu David kuoma chun a hung a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a. Chun, David chun, “Mephiboseth,” a ta. Ama chun, “En ta, i siehlaw hi,” a tih a, a dawn a."
"And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, i pa Jonathan zârah lunginsiet ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, i pu Saula ram po po inneitir nâwk ka ti cheh a; chun, ka dawkânah buthlêng awt ve rawp ta hlak i tih,” a ta."
"And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?","Chun, chibai a bûk a, “Kei, ui thitlaw ang el, i siehlaw hi ieng am a nia i ngaisak a ni leh?” a ta."
"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son.","Chuongchun, lal chun Saula siehlaw Ziba chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Saula thil po po le, a sûnghai thilhai po po chu i pu naupa hi ka pêk vawng a nih."
"And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.","Chun, a ta dingin hnuoi inlet- pêk i ta, nang le i naupasalhai le i siehlawhai leh; chun, i pu naupa chun fâk dinghai a nei theina dingin i thawsuokhai chu hung lâng i ta, i pu naupa Mephiboseth ruok hin chu ka dawkânah buthlêng awt rawp a tih,” a ta. Ziba chun naupasal sâwmpanga le siehlaw sâwmhni a nei a."
"Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.","Chuongchun, Ziba chun lal kuomah, “Lal ka puin a siehlaw kuoma thu a pêk ang po po hin i siehlaw hin thâwng a tih,” a ta.

"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.","Mephiboseth chun naupasal naupang hi a nei a, a hming chu Mika a nih. Chun, Ziba ina um po pohai chu Mephiboseth siehlawhai an na."
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.,"Chuongchun, Mephiboseth chu Jerusalema chun a um tah a, lal dawkâna chun buthlêng a awt ve rawp ta sih a; a ke chu khinghnia inbai a nih."
