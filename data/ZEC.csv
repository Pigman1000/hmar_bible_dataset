"In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,","Daria inlal kum hnina a thla rietnaah, Iddo naupa, Berekia naupa zâwlnei Zekaria kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
Jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers.,“In thlatuhai chunga khan LALPA chu a lungni naw êm êm a.
"Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chuleiin, nangin an kuomah, LALPA chun, hieng hin a tih tiin hril rawh: Sipaihai LALPA chun, ka kuomah hung kîr ro, a tih; chuongchun, in kuomah hung kîr vêng ka tih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith Jehovah.","Inhmaa zâwlneihaiin an kuoma, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: in thilthaw rilohai le, in um dân khawhlonahaia inthawk khan hung kîr ro,’ a tih tia a hril a, ngai si lohai le, keia tieng khawm pawisa si lohai, in thlatuhai ang khan um naw ro, LALPA chun a tih."
"Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?",In thlatuhai chu khâw lai am an um tah a? Zâwlneihai khawm chu an dam zing am a nih?
"But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.","Amiruokchu, ka thuhai le ka thuruothai, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai thu ka ipêkhai chu, chuonghai chun in thlatuhai chu an hnawtphâk tah ni lo am a nih?

"Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,","Daria inlal kum hnina, thla sâwmpakhatna Sebat thla, ni sâwm- hni pali ni chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
"I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.","“Zâna hin thil ka hmuh a, mi pakhat sakawr sen chunga chuong hi ka hmuh a, ama chu hmun inruom inhmui thing lai hin a ngîr zing a; chun, a hnunga chun sakawr sen dâm, a buong dâm, a vâr dâm hi an um a."
"Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.","Chun, keiin ‘Aw pu, hienghai hi ieng am an nih a?’ ka ta. Vântirko kei mi betu chun ka kuomah, ‘Hieng hi ieng am an ni inentir ka ti che,’ a ta."
"And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.","Chun, inhmui thing buk laia ngîrpa chun a dawn a, ‘Hienghai hi LALPAIN hnuoi chung kil tin kil tanga fe dinga a tirhai chu an nih,’ a ta."
"And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.","Chun, anni chun LALPA vântir- ko inhmui thing laia ngîr chu an dawn a, ‘Hnuoi chung kil tin kil tanga chun kan fe tah a, ngai ta, leihnuoi po po chu a ṭhung ṭawk ṭawkin, râlmuongin a um a nih,’ an ta."
"Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun a dawn a. ‘Aw sipaihai LALPA, kum sâwmsari sûng rau an chunga nasa- taka lunginsenna i nei, Juda khaw- puihai le Jerusalem chunga hin ieng chen am zângaina nei loin i um ding a na?’ a ta."
"And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, even comfortable words.","Chun, vântirko kei mi betu chu LALPA chun thu ṭhatakhai, thu thlamuongumtakhai chun a dawn tah a."
"So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.","Chuongchun, vântirko a mi betu chun ka kuomah, ‘Hieng ang hin khêk rawh: Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Jerusalem le Zion chu nasatakin ka thîk a nih."
"And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.","Chuongchun, hnam nuomsaa umhai chunga chun ka lungni naw êm êm a; lungni naw dep chu ka ni deh a, anni chun sukrinumna chu an sukzuol pei sih a, tiin,’ a ta."
"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun a tih: ‘Zângaina leh Jerusalema chun ka hung kîr nâwk a; chutaka chun ka in chu bâwl a ni ding a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih; chun, Jerusalem chunga hin inkhina hmawl keimar nîng a tih."
"Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.","La khêk nâwk la, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ka khawpuihai chu hausakna leiin hung inzar lien a ta; chun, LALPA chun, Zion chu la thlamuon nâwk a ta, Jerusalem chu la thlang nâwk a tih,’” tiin."
"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.","Chun, ka mithai ka hang inlên a, ka en a; chun, ki pali hi ka hmu a. Chun, vântirko a mi betu kuoma chun, “Hieng hi ieng am an nih a?” ka tih a."
"And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.","Ama chun, “Hi kihai hi Juda le Israel le Jerusalem sukdartuhai chu an nih,” tiin a mi dawn a."
And Jehovah showed me four smiths.,"Chun, LALPA chun thîrsu pali hi a mîn hmutir a."
"Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.","Chun, keiin, “Hieng hi ieng thaw dinga hung am an na?” ka tih a. Ama chun, “Hieng hi Juda sukdartu kihai chu an nih a, tukhawma an lu dawm kâng an ngam ngai nawh a; nisienlakhawm, hienghai hi, sukdar dinga Juda ram chunga an ki inlettu hnamhai kihai chu pei thla dinga, anni chu sukhmang dinga hung an nih,” a tih a."
"Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.","LALPA kâwlinlephai siemtu ngei chu, LALPA kuoma chun ruo nuhnung huna hin ruo ngên ro; chun ama chun ruopui sûr chu pêng a tih, loa thlaihna tin kuoma chun."
"For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.","Milim chun teplo mei mei a hril a, a lo dawngtuhai khawm chun khêl thu chu an hmu sih a; manga mang- tuhai khawm chun khêl mei mei an mang a, a thlâwn elin an insukthla- muong a nih; chuleiin, berâm angin anni lampui chu an hrawh a, sukrimsikin an um hlak, berâmpu a um naw leiin."
"Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.","Berampuhai chunga chun ka lunginsenna chu a chawk a, kêlchal- hai chu ka hrem ngei ding a nih; sipaihai LALPA chun a berâmruol Juda sûngkuohai chu a hung sir tah a, indonaa sakawr ṭhatak angin a siem ngei ding a nih."
"From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.","Amaa inthawkin a kiha lung dâm, amaa inthawkin a kilna dâm, amaa inthawkin indona thalngul dâm, amaa inthawkin rorêltu dâm an hung suok tlâng vawng ding a ni sih a."
"And they shall be as mighty men, treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.","Chun, indona chun an hmêlma- hai chu kawtthlêra chirhak chîl anga chîlin mi thilthawtheitakhai hung nîng an ta, LALPA chu an kuomah a um zing leiin, anni chu do an tih; chun, sakawr chunga chuong mihai khawm chu sukhamhaiin um an tih."
"And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.","Chun, Juda insûng chu hung sukhrât ka ta, Josef insûng chu sandam ka tih; chun, anni chu hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk ka tih, an chungah lunginsietna ka nei sih a; chun, anni chu ka lo pei thlâk naw ang hrimin um tâng an tih; chun, an thu chu ngai bawk ka ta, LALPA an Pathien ka ni sih a."
"And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.","Chun, Ephraimhai kha chu mi thilthawtheitak ang nîng an ta, uoin leiin an lungril chu hlim a tih; anih, an thlahai chu hmûng an ta, lâwm an tih; an lungril khawm chu LALPAA chun lâwm bawk a tih."
"I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.","An ta dingin faifûk ka ta, anni ko khâwm ka tih; anni chu kân tlan ta sih a; a lo pung ta ang bawk khan hung insukpung an tih."
"And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.","Chun, anni chu mipuihai laia chun tûng ka ta; ram hlataka khawm mi hre zing an tih; chun, an nau le têhai leh um an ta, hung kîr nâwk an tih."
"I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.",Aigupta rama inthawk khawm- in anni chu hung ṭhuoi suok nâwk ka ta. Assuria rama inthawkin la khâwm nâwk ka tih; Gilead le Lebanon rama chun ṭhuoi lût ka ta; an ta dinga hmun indai naw hielin.
"And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.","Chun, ama chun sukrinumna tuisuoriet chu fe thleng a ta, tui- suorieta chun a fâwnhai chu thâwng a ta. Nile li inthûkhai po po khawm chu kang intan a tih; chun, Assuria chapona chu sukhnuoi nîng a ta, Aigupta lalhmawl chu fe hmang tâng a tih."
"And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah.","Chun, anni chu LALPAA chun sukhrât ka ta, chun, ama hmingin a suk a tungin fe tâng an tih, LALPA chun a tih."
"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.","Aw Lebanon, i kawtkhârhai hawng rawh, I sidar thinghai chu meiin a kâng hmang theina dingin!"
"Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.","Aw fâr thing, inrûm rawh, sidar chu a tlu leiin; A ṭhatakhai chu suksiet an ni ta sih a! Basana thingsaisuohai, inrûm ro, Ramhâk chu a chau ta sih a!"
A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.,"Berâmpuhai inrûm ri chu e, An ropuina suksiet a ni ta sih a! Chu, sakeibaknei vânglai inrûm râwlri chu! Jordan ramngaw chu suksiet a ni ta sih a."
Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;,"LALPA ka Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Sathattu berâm ruol chu châwm rawh,"
"whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.","ân chawtuhai chun anni chu an that a, anni chu suolah an inngai nawh a; chun, anni zawrtu khawm chun, ‘LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se, ka hausa sih a’, an ta; an berâmpuhai ngei khawm chun anni chu an lunginsiet nawh."
"For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.","Ram hluotuhai chu ka lunginsiet ta naw ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih; nisienlakhawm, en ta, mihai chu, mi tin el chu mâni tuolbâwmhai kutah pêng ka ta, an lalhai kuta leh; chun, ram chu thâwng an ta, an kuta inthawk chun anni chu sansuok naw ningah,” tiin."
"So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.","Chuongchun, sathattu berâm ruol chu ka châwm a, berâm ruol chautak el nang chu. Chun, hmawl pahni ka lâk a, pakhat chu Ditsak kân bûk a, a dang chu Pumkhatna kân bûk a; chun, berâm ruol chu ka châwm tah a."
"And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.","Chun, thla khat sûngin berâmpu pathumhai chu ka pei thlâk a; ka lungrilin anni chu a nghawk a, anni lungril khawma kei an mi nghawk bawk sih a."
"Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.","Chun, kei chun, “Châwm ta naw ning cheu, a thi thi chu thi sienla; pei thlâka um um chu pei thlâkin um sienla; a la damhai khawm chun anni le anni sa chu infatuo raw hai seh,” ka ta."
"And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.","Chun, ka hmawl Ditsak chu ka lâk a, ka sât bawng tah a, hnamhai po po le ka thuthlung ka siem chu ka sût theina dingin."
And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, chu ni chun sût a lo ni tah a, chuongchun, berâm ruol, nang kei mi pawisatu chun LALPA thu a nih ti i hriet a."
"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “In ngaia a ṭha chun ka hlaw chu mi pe unla, a ni naw chun, hrên el ro,” ka ta. Chuongchun, ka hlaw ding chun tangka sâwmthum an bûk tah a."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Sum bâwmah the lût el rawh, man ṭhatak, annia ka man hi,” a tih a, chuong tangka sâwmthum chu ka lâk a, LALPA ina sum bâwma chun ka the lût tah a."
"Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.","Chun, ka hmawl dang pakhat Pumkhatna chu ka sât bawng nâwk a, Juda le Israel inkâra inunauna chu ka suktan theina dingin."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Berâmpu invêt hmangruohai kha la la nâwk rawh."
"For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.","En ta, rama chun Berâmpu pei thlâka umhai chu kankuo ngailo ding le, sukdara um chu zawng ngailo ding le, suktlieka um khawm chu sukdam ngailo ding chu, ka tungding nâwk ding a ni sih a; ama chun a hliem le a hrisêl khawm chu châwm chuong naw nih a, a thâu thâu sa chu fa lem a ta, an tinhai chu nawi tamtakin kei nawi a tih,” a ta."
"Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.","Berâmpu, berâm ruol mâk- santu chung chu a va rik de!

"The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:","Israel chungthua LALPA thu phurrik chu, Vânhai chu kei- phar a, leihnuoi lungphûmhai chu phûm a, mihriem chu a sûnga a thlarau siempêktu LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:"
"Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.","“Ngai ta, a vêla hnamhai po po ta dingin Jerusalem chu inthinna noah siem ka ta, chun, Juda chunga khawm, Jerusalem inhuol nia chun chuong ang chu nîng a tih."
"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.","Chu nia chun hieng hi hung nîng a ta, hnam po pohai ta dingin Jerusalem chu lung phurriksakah siem ka ta, chuonga amaa insukrik- tuhai po po nasataka sukhliem nîng an ta; chuongchun, hnuoi chunga hnam po pohai a chunga chun inhâwrkhâwm an tih,” tiin."
"In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.","LALPA chun a tih, “Chu nia chun sakawr tin chu maktinain hrem ka ta, a chunga chuongtu chu invêt- nain; chun, Juda insûng chunga chun ka mit meng ka ta, hnam tin sakawr chu mit indelnain hrem ka tih."
"And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.","Chun, Juda lalhai chun an lung- rilin, ‘An Pathien sipaihai LALPAA chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chu ka hrâtna an nih,’ la tîng an tih."
"In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and they of Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.","“Chu nia chun Juda lalhai chu thing laia mei thuk ang le, buphal laia meiser angin siem ka ta; vawitienga le changtienga, an vêla hnam po pohai chu sukbo an ta; chun, Jerusalem chu ama hmun Jerusalem- a ngei chun a la chêng ding a nih,” tiin."
"Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.","LALPA chun a hmasatakin Juda puon inhai khawm chu sanhim a ta, David sûngkaw ropuina le Jerusalem hluotuhai ropuina chu Juda chung- tienga chawimawia a um nawna dingin."
"In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them.","Chu ni chun LALPA chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chu hliekhûng a ta, chu nia anni laia hrât naw chu David ang nîng a ta; chun, David sûngkuo chu Pathien ang, an hmaa LALPA vântirko ang chu nîng a tih."
"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.","Chun, chu nia chun Jerusalem hung thawtu hnam po pohai chu suksietna ding zawng vêng ka tih."
"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.","Chun, David sûngkaw chunga le, Jerusalem hluotuhai chunga chun zângaina le hni châkna thlarau buok ka ta, kei an mi sun tahnung chu mi en an tih; miin a nau khât ta dinga an sûn hlak angin ama chu sûn an ta, miin a nau lutîr chu nasataka a tuorpui hlak angin nasatakin tuorpui an tih."
"In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.","Chu ni chun, Megiddo ruoma Hadad-rimmon ṭa angin, Jerusalema chun nasataka sûnna um a tih."
"And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;","Ram chun sûngkaw tinhai chu a tum sengin sûn a tih; David sûngkaw pahnam chu a tumin, an nuhmeihai khawm a tumin; Nathan sûngkaw pahnam chu a tumin, an nuhmeihai khawm a tumin;"

"all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.","sûngkuo po po a umhai chu, sûngkaw tin chu a tumin, an nu- hmeihai khawm a tumin."
"In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.","“Chu ni chun inthieng nawna le suolnaa dingin, David sûng- kuo le Jerusalema chêngtuhai ta dingin tuikhur hawngpêk nîng a tih,”"
"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.","Sipaihai LALPA chun a tih, “Chu nia chun hieng hi hung nîng a tih: rama inthawk hin milimhai hming chu pei thlâng ka ta, hriet zing ni ta naw ni hai; chun, zâwlneihai le thlarau inthieng nawhai chu hi rama inthawk hin infe hmangtir ka tih."
"And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of Jehovah; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.","Chun, anni mi tukhawma an thu an la hrillâwk zing chun, an nu le pa anni neitu ngei chun, ‘Dam naw ti ni; LALPA hmingin khêlthu i hril sih a,’ tîng an tih; chuongchun, a thu hril lai le le chun a nu le pa ama neitu chun ama chu sunthleng an tih."
"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:","Chun, chuong ni chun hieng hi hung nîng a ta, thu a hrillâwk lai chun, zâwlnei po pohai, mi tin el chun mâni thilhmulâwk chu inzâpui an ta; hlêm dingin puon inhmul sil naw bawk an tih;"

"And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms?

"Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.","“Aw kâwlhnâm, ka berâmpu chunga le, mi ka ruolpâwl chunga chun har rawh,” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih. “Berâmpu chu vaw la, berâmhai chu indar an tih; chun, a chînhai chunga chun kei khawma ka kut inlet ka tih,” tiin."
"And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.","LALPA chun, “Chu nia chun hieng hi hung nîng a ta, ram po poa chun, chutaka hmun hni chu sât thlâk nîng an ta, thîng an tih; chun, a hmun thumna chu hla nîng an tih."
"And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.","Chun, a hmun thumna chu meiah infethlengtir ka ta, tangkaruo chu sukthieng a ni angin sukthieng ka ta, rângkachak chu fie a ni ang- in fieng ka tih: chun, ka hming lam an ta, kei khawma anni chu ngai tâng ka tih; ‘Ka mihai an nih,’ tîng ka ta; chun, anni khawma, ‘LALPA chu ka Pathien a nih,’ mi tîng an tih,” a ta."
"Behold, a day of Jehovah cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.","Ngai ta, LALPA ni chu a hung tlung ie, nangmaa inthawka râllâk sum i sûnga an insem ni ding chu."
"For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.","Jerusalem chu do dingin hnam po po chu ka kei khâwm ding a ni sih a; khawpui chu lâk nîng a ta, inhai chu kâpkhumin um an ta, nuhmeihai chu ṭhuoi hmangin um an ta, chun, a khawpui chenve zet chu salah fêng an ta, mi la um sunhai ruok chu khaw- puia inthawka sât thlâk ni naw ni hai."

"And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.","Chu nia chun a kehai chu Oliv tlânghai, Jerusalem sak ela umhai chunga chun ngîr a ta, chun, Oliv tlânghai chu a laia chun saktieng le thlangtienga chun kakintan a ta, chuongchun, ruom nasatak hung um a tih; chun, chu tlâng chenve chu hmârtieng insawn a ta, a chenve dang chu simtieng insawn a tih."
"And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee.","Chun, ka tlânghai ruoma chun tlânsieng in ta; tlânghai ruom chun Azel a tlung rak ding a ni sih a: anih, Juda lal Uzzia inlal laia simkhaw- leihnuoi inhnînga in tlânsiet ang khan, tlânsieng in tih; chun, LALPA ka Pathien chu hung a tih, a kuoma mi inthienghai po po leh."

"And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.","Chun, ram inthienga chun LALPA chun a chanpuol dingin Juda chu hluong a ta, Jerusalem chu thlang tâng a tih.”"
"Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.","Mi po pohai, LALPA hmaa chun to ṭhiep ro khai: a chêngna inthienga inthawk chun a hung thohar ta sih a."
"And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.","Chun, thiempu lal Josua LALPA vântirko hmaa ngîr le, Setan chu a khingpui ni dinga a changtienga ngîr chu a mîn entir a."
"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Aw Setan, LALPA chun a kâwk che hi!

"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.","Chun, Josua chu silfên ṭawptakin ân thuom a, vântirko hmaa chun a ngîr tah a."
"And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him.

"And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.","Chun, keiin, “A lu chungah lu- kâwm mawitak inkâwmtir raw hai se,” ka ta.

"And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun Josua kuomah a hril a,"
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ka lampuihaiah i fe a, ka iphût chu i thaw bawk chun, ka insûng ro rêl i ta, ka in inhuonna tuollaihai chu vawng ṭha bawk i tih.

"Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.","Tuhin thiempu lal aw Josua, nang le i hmaa i rawihai ṭhung hlakhai le chun ngai ta u; inchikna dinga mihai an ni sih a; ngai ta u, a Kau, ka siehlaw chu ka hung lâk suok ding a ni sih a."
"For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.","En ta u, Josua hmaa chun lung pakhat sîr sari nei ka sie a; ngai ta u, chutaka chun thil ziek ker ka ta, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih, chun, ni khat sûngin chu ram suolna chu sawn hmang ka tih."

"And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chu a hung nâwk a, mi a in lai sukhar angin a mi hung sukhar tah a."
"And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;","Ka kuoma chun, “Ieng am i hmu a?” a ta.

"And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chu kân dawn a, “Pu, hieng hi ieng am an na?” tiin."
"Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chun ka kuomah, “Hieng hi ieng am an ni i hriet naw maw?” tiin a mi dawn a. Kei chun, “Aw pu, ka hriet nawh,” ka ta."
"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Ama chun ka kuomah, “Hi hi Zerubbabel kuoma LALPA thu, ‘Sipai- in ni loin, thilthawtheina khawma ni loin, amiruokchu, ka thlarauin,’ tiha sipaihai LALPAIN a hril chu a nih,” a ta."
"Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.","Aw tlâng lien, tu am i na?

"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chu nawa khawm LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.,"“Hi in lungphûm hi Zerubbabel kuthai chun a lo phûm tah a; a kuthai chun zo khawm zo ngei a tih; chun, nang chun sipaihai LALPA chun a mi hung tir a nih ti hre tâng i tih."
"For who hath despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.","Thil chînhai ni chu tuin am a hmusit hlak hrim a?

"Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?","Chun, keiin a kuomah, “Hieng oliv thing pahni sathâu khâwnvar siena sîr changtienga mi le vawi- tienga mi hi ieng am an nih a?” ka ta."
"And I answered the second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil out of themselves?","A vawi hninaa khawm kân dawn nâwk a, a kuomah, “Rângka- chak hriek hung suokna rângkachak dâwt pahni kâwla oliv kau pahni hi ieng am an nih a?” ka ta."

"Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.","Chun, ka mithai chu ka hang inlên nâwk a, lekha zuol vuong lai ka hmuh a, ka en zing a. Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Ieng am i hmuh a?” a ta."

"Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off on the other side according to it.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hi hi ṭawngsie ram pumpui chunga fe suok hlak chu a nih, tukhawm inru ta- phawt chu phêk khingkhata ziek anga pei thlâk nîng a ta, tukhawm inkhâm taphawt chu phêk khing- tienga ziek anga pei thlâk a ni ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
"I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.","Chun, sipaihai LALPA chun, “Infe suoktir ka ta, inru ina chun lût a ta, ka hminga khêla inkhâmtu ina le chun: chuongchun, a in sûnga chun chêng a ta, chun, chutaka a lunghai le a thinghai le chun kâng hmang a tih,” a ta."
"Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chu a fe suok a, ka kuomah, “Tuhin i mit hang inlên la, hi a fe suok hi ieng am a na en ta,” a ta."
"And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land","Kei chun, “Ieng am a na?” ka ta. Ama chun, “Hi hi bâwm a fe suok chu a nih,” a ta. “Hi hi ram po poa an khawhlona chu a nih,” a ti bawk a."

"And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.","Chun, “Hi hi Khawhlona a nih,” a ta; bâwm sûnga chun a nam lût nâwk a; a bau chu suon riktak chun a sîn nâwk a."
"Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.","Chun, ka mithai ka hang inlên a, nuhmei pahni hung suok hi ka hmuh a, ka en zing a, an thlahaia chun thli hi a um a; anni chun vakâwl thlahai ang hi thla an nei a; chun, vân le hnuoi inkâra chun bâwm chu an khai a."

"And he said unto me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.","Ama chun, “Sinar rama a in bâwlpêk dingin, bâwl zo a ni pha chun chutaka chun bâwm chu ama inṭhut- na ngeia chun sie nîng a tih,” a tih a."
"And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.","Chun, ka mithai ka hang inlên nâwk a, tlâng pahni inkâra sa- kawr tawlailîr pali hung suok hi ka hmuh a, ka en zing a; chu tlânghai chu dârsen tlâng an nih."

"And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.","Vântirko chun a mi dawn a, ka kuomah, “Hieng hi vân thlarau pali, leihnuoi po po Lalpa hmaa ngîr hlaka, fe suok hlakhai chu an nih.”"
The chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.,"Tawlailîr sakawr dum ihnûk chu hmâr ram tieng a fe suok hlak a; a vâr ihnûk chun a zui a; chun, a râng ihnûk chu simtieng rama chun a fe suok a."

"Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts unto me, saying,","Chun, sipaihai LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?","“Hi rama mi po pohai le thiem- puhai kuoma chun hieng ang hin thu hril rawh, ‘Hi kum sâwmsari sûnga thla sarina le thla nganaa bu in ngheia in insuklungngai hin, keia kuoma, keima kuom ngeia bu nghei am in ni ngût le?"
"And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?",In fâk a in dâwn lai khawmin in ta dingin in fâkin in dâwn ni lo am a nih?
"Should ye not hear the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?","Hausakna le Jerusalem le a vêla khawpuihai le Simtieng le ram- phaihai chu hluo a ni laia, zâwlnei hmasahai hmanga LALPAIN thu a khêkpuihai chu in ngai naw ding am a nih?’ tiin,” a ta."
"And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,","Chun, Zekaria kuoma chun LAL- PA thu chu a hung tlung a, “Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin thu a hril a nih:"
"Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;","Rorêlna ṭha chu suksuok un- la, mi tinin mâni unau chungah zângaina le lunginsietna inlangtir raw se;"
"and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.","hmeithai amanih, fahrâ ama- nih, mikhuol amanih, mi pasie amani khawm chu nêksâwr naw unla, chun, nangni tukhawma mâni unau chung- ah a lungrilin thil suol suongtuo naw raw se,” tiin."
"But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.","Nisienlakhawm, an pawisa nuom nawh a, an liengko an her- hmang a, an hriet nawna dingin an nahai an suksêt a."
"Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.","Anih, an lungrilhai chu lungthîr angin an siem a, chuong ni naw sien chu dân le inhmaa zâwlneihai hmanga a thlaraua sipaihai LALPA- IN a pêk thuhai chu an hriet ta ding bah; chuleiin, sipaihai LALPAA in- thawka lunginsenna nasatak chu a hung tlung tah a."
"And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts;","Chun, ama a khêk laiin an ngai nawh a; chuongchun, anni chu khêk an ta, kei khawma ngai naw ningah, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.","amiruokchu, an la hriet ngailo hnam po po laia chun thlivirin anni ka sukdar tah a. Chuongchun, ram chu râusanin a um tah a, tukhawm an fe thlengin an kîr nâwk ngai ta nawh a: ram duthusâm tak chu râusanah an siem ta leiin."
"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,","Chun, sipaihai LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Zion chu îtthîkna nasatakin ka îtthîk a, lungsenna nasatak leh ama chu ka îtthîk a nih,” tiin."
"Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Ziona chun ka hung kîr a, Jerusalem sûnga chun chêng ka tih; chun, Jerusalem chu, ‘Thudik khawpui,’ ti nîng a ta; sipaihai LALPA tlâng chu, ‘Tlâng inthieng,’ ti nîng a tih,” tiin."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Jerusalem kawtthlêrhaia chun pitar le putarhai, tar êm êm leia kuta funghrawl ṭhunhai chu la um an tih."
And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.,"Chun, a khawpui kawtthlêrhai chu pasaltê le nuhmeitê kawt- thlêrhaia inhnelin la sip bawk an tih,” tiin."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Chuong nihaia chun hi chi hlaa umhai mithmua hin a mak hle chun, keia mithmua khawm a mak hle naw ding am a nih?” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Ngai ta, ka mihai chu saktieng ram le thlangtieng rama inthawkin sandam ka ta;"
"and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.","anni chu hung ṭhuoi ka ta, Jerusalem sûnga chun chêng an tih; chun, anni chu ka mihai nîng an ta, kei chu, felna le indiknain an Pathien nîng ka tih,” tiin."
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “LALPA in, biekin ngei chu, bâwl a ni theina dinga lungphûm phûma a um nia, zâwlnei lo um tahai baua inthawka thuhai vawisûn nia hretu- hai, in kuthai chu sukhrât ro."
"For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.","Khâng nihaia khan chu mi- hriem ta dingin inhlawfâkna a um nawh a, ran ta ding khawma inhlaw- fâkna hrim a um nawh a; hmêlma leiin mi a lût le suok ta ding khawma muongna hrim a um nawh: mi po po mâni tuolbâwmhai kalin ka sie sih a."
"But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Amiruokchu, tuhin chu hi chi hlaa umhai ta ding hin chu khâng lai nihaia ang kha chu ka ni ta naw ding a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
"For there shall be the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.","Inremna chi chu a um ta ding a ni sih a; grêphrui chun a ra insuong a ta, leihnuoi khawm chun a hlâwkna chu insuo bawk a ta, vânhai khawm chun daidaw chu hung pêng an ta; hi chi hlaa umhai hi chuong thilhai po po chu inhluotir ka tih."
"And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.","Chun, hnam tinhai laia ṭawng- sephur in ni ang khan, aw Juda sûng- kuo le Israel sûngkuo, hung sanhim ka ti cheu a, malsâwmna hung ni tâng in tih: ṭi naw unla, in kuthai chu sukhrât phawt phawt el ro,” tiin."
"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not;","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a, “In thlatuhaiin lunginsen dinga an mi chawktho laiin in chunga thil ṭha naw thaw ka lungril a, chu chu kân sîr naw bawk angin, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih;"
so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.,"chuong ang tak chun, hieng nihaia hin Juda insûng le Jerusalem chunga hin thil ṭha thaw ka lungril a nih, ṭi dêr naw ro."
These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;,"Hienghai hi thil in thaw dinghai chu an nih: mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm kuomah thu indiktak hril raw se: in kul kawtkhârhaia chun inremna le indikna rorêlna chu suksuok unla,"

"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,","Chun, sipaihai LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih: Thla lina bu ngheina le, thla ngana bu ngheina le, thla sarina bu ngheina le, thla sâwmna bu ngheina chu Juda sûngkuo ta ding chun hlimna le lâwmna le thafânna ruoiṭhehai an ni lem ding a nih: chu- leiin, indikna le inremna hi ngaina ro,” tiin."

"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Chuong nihaia chun hnam po po laia mi sâwmin, ‘Pathien chu i kuomah a um ti kan hriet sih a; keini khawma hung zui vêng kan ti che,’ tiin Juda mi chu a puonhmawrah an la chel ngei ding a nih,” tiin."
"The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah);","Hadrak ram chunga LALPA thu phurrik chu, Damaska chu ân nghatna hmun nîng a tih; mihriem le Israel hnam po po mit chu LALPA tieng a ngha ta sih a;"

"And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.","Tura chun kul dettakhai a ta dingin a bâwl a, tangka chu pilvut ang el le rângkachak inthieng chu khawlai chirhak ang elin a sie- khâwl a."

"And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.",Asdoda chun hnam inthlapawl chu chêng an ta; Philistin mihai chapona chu sât thlâng ka tih.
