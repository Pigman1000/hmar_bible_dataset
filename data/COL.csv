"We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,","In ta dinga ṭawngṭai rawpin, Pathien ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pa kuoma chun lâwmthu kan hril hlak:"
"having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints,","Chu chu, Krista Isua in ringna le mi inthieng po pohai chunga in hmangaina chu kan lo hriet leiin le,"

"who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;","Ama chu hmu thei naw Pathien angpui, nau lutîr, thilsiemhai po po nêka chunghnung lem a nih."
"for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him;","Amaa chun iengkim siem a ni sih a; vâna umhai, hnuoia umhai leh, hmu thei lo le hmu theihai le chun, lalṭhungphahai khawm, rorêlnahai khawm, inlalnahai khawm, thunei- nahai khawm, iengkim amaa chun, ama ta ding bawka siem a nih."
"and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.","Chun, ama hi chu iengkim um hmain a um hrim a nih, amaa chun iengkim a ngir khâwm bawk a nih."

For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in him should all the fulness dwell;,"Pa lungni zâwngtak chu hi hi a ni sih a: Pathien famkimna tinrêng chu amaa a um zing le,"
"and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, I say, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.","a kraws thisen chun inremna hung siemin, amaa chun iengkim, ama ngeia chun hnuoia thil umhai le vâna thil umhai khawm, ama le inremtir hi."

"yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu a taksa thina ngei khan ama leh ân remtir ta cheu a nih, a hmaa chun inthiengtak le hmêlhemlo le, sawisêl boa ân ngirtir theina ding cheuin."
"if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister.","Amiruokchu, in ringna chun innghatsan neiin dettakin in um ding a nih.

"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church;","Tuta ka tuorpêkna cheua hin ka lâwm a, Krista rinum tuor bâk chu a taksa leiin ka taksaa hin ka sunzawm pei a nih, a taksa chu kohran hi a nih."

"For I would have you know how greatly I strive for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;","Nangni le Laodikeia umhai le, taksaa ka hmêl hmu naw phawthai ta dingin iengti raua nasain am ka thaw pêk ṭâl ṭâl zie cheu hi in hriet ka nuom sih a."

"This I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.","Tûkhawma bau thiema an hlêm nâwna ding cheuin, chuong chu ka ti a nih."
"For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.","Ka taksain in kuomah um naw lang khawm, in felzie le Krista in ring detzie hre zingin lâwmtakin thlaraua chun in kuomah ka um sih a."
"As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,","Chuleiin, Krista Isu, Lalpa chu in pawm ang khan amaa chun um ro."
"rooted and builded up in him, and established in your faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.","Amaa zung kei le, rem sâng deu deua umin, an inchûktir ang cheu khan, lâwmthu hrilna hauin, in ringnaa chun dettakin um ro."
"Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:","Fimkhur ro, chuong naw chun, tûkhawmin Krista thu ang ni loin, mihriem thurosie le khawvêl A AW B ang lemin an thu var le hlêmna mei meiin râl lâkin la rawi an ti cheu."
"for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,",Amaa chun Pathien famkimna tinrêng chu taksa neiin a um zing sih a.
"and in him ye are made full, who is the head of all principality and power:","Amaa chun in famkim ta bawk a, ama chu inlalna le thuneina po po lu a nih."
"in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;","Krista sertannaa chun mihriem tisa suol chu hlîp vawngin, ama bawka chun kuta sertan ni lova sertan in ni kha."
"having been buried with him in baptism, wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.","Baptismaa chun a kuoma phûm in lo ni ve ta sih a, chu bawka chun mithi laia ama keithotu Pathien sinthaw awi leia a kuoma keitho in ni ve kha."
"And you, being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, I say, did he make alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;","Chun, nangni bawsietnahai le tisaa sertan nâwna leiin thi in lo nih a, nangni ngei chu ama leh a sukhring cheu in ni kha. Ei baw- sietnahai po po a mi ngaidam a."
"having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;","Batna lekha thupêka ziek, ei chunga um a mi kal hlaktu chu a thaibo ta sih a; chu ngei chu krawsa hemdein a lâk hmang tah a."
"having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.","Chun, inlalna le thuneinahai chu hlîp thlain, chu krawsa chun chuonghai chu hnein, ân langa inhriettirnain a hmang tah a."
"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day:","Chuongchun, fâk thua manih, dâwn thua manih, ruoiṭhe ni thua manih, thla thar thua manih, châwlni thua manih tûkhawmin sawisêl naw raw hai se cheu;"
which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s.,"chuonghai chu thil hung tlung dinghai hlim a nih, a tak ruok chu Krista ta a nih."
"Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,","Mâni insukhnuoi fâwmna le vântirko biekna ngaisâng a, inlârnaa innghat a, an tisa tieng nuom zâwng hlêmna mei meia insukpuithu mi an um a; chuong ang mihai chun in lâwmman chu inchântir naw raw hai se cheu."

"If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances,","Khawvêl dânhai chu Krista kuoma in thi san ve ta chun, iengdinga khawvêla la hring anga hieng thupêk,"
"Handle not, nor taste, nor touch","“Them naw la, intem naw la, tâwk bawk naw” ti mihriemhai dân siemfâwm le inchûktirna hnuoia hin in intuklût am?"

"Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.","Hieng vântirko biek ding ti dâm, mâni insukhnuoi ti dâm le, tak- sa sukrinum ding tihai hi thaw âwm takin ân lang ngei; nisienlakhawm, taksa nuom zâwng hnêna ding chun iengkhawm a ṭhahnem chuong dêr nawh."
"If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.","Chuongchun, Krista kuomah keithoin in um ve ta chun, chung tieng, Pathien changtienga ṭhung Krista umnaa thil umhai chu zawng ro;"
"Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.","chung tienga thil umhaia chun in lungril innghat tlat ro, hnuoia thil umhaia chun innghat loin."
"For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.","In thi tah a, in hringna chu Pathiena chun Krista kuomah thupin a um sih a."
"When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.",Krista in hringna chu a hung inlâr pha chun nangni khawm ama kuomah ropuiin inlâr vêng in tih.
"Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;","Chuongchun, nangnia um hnuoi tieng thilhai chu sukhlum ro, inditna dâm, inthieng nawna dâm, hurna dâm, châkna suol dâm, duâmna dâm hi, duâmna chu milim biekna a ni sih a."
for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:,Chuong thilhai lei chun a nih Pathien lunginsenna chu awi naw nauhai chungah a hung tlung hlak chu.
"wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things;","Nangni khawm inhmaa chuong ang thilhaia in hring lai khan, chuonghaia chun in um hlak kha."
"but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:","Tu ruok hin chu nangni khawmin hieng po po, inngâwkna dâm, lunginsenna dâm, theidâna dâm, hrilsietna dâm, in baua suok ṭawng zâmawhai hi sukbo ro."
"lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,","Khêl inhril tuo naw ro, mihriem hlui chu a thilthawhai leh in hlîp thlâk tah a."
"and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:","Mihriem thar chun in inthuom ta sih a, chu mihriem thar chu, hriet famkimna nei dingin a siemtu angpui anga siem tharin a um mêk a nih;"
"where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.","chutaka chun Grik mi le Juda mi, sertan le tan lo, hnamchawm dâm, Skuthia mi dâm, suok dâm, suok naw dâm khawm an um thei nawh, Krista chu iengkim ni lemin, iengkimah a um bawk a nih."
"Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;","Chuongchun, Pathien mi thlang, mi inthieng le dittakhai angin inlai- natna lungril dâm, ngilneina dâm, inngaitlâwmna dâm, thuhnuoirawlna dâm, dawtheina dâm chun inthuom ro."

"and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.","Chun, chuong po po chunga chun hmangaina inbel ro, chu chu khuop famkimna a nih."
"And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.","Chun, Krista thlamuonna chun in lungrilah ro rêl raw se; chuong ang ni dingin taksa pumkhata ko in ni hrim in sawnnaw; lawm nachâng hre bawk ro."

"Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.","Pahai, in nauhai suknuor naw ro, chuong naw chun, an bei dawng rawi a tih."
"Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:","Suokhai, tisaa in hotuhai thu hi iengkimah zâwm ro; mihriem suk- lâwmtuhai ang ela mit rawng bâwl loin, lungril hmunkhat puta Lalpa ṭi dêk pumin zâwm lem ro."
