"in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;",Chatuona hringna beiseina chu Pathien khêl hril thei naw chun leilung insieng hmain a tiem a;
"but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;","nisienlakhawm, ama hun taka- hai chun a thu chu thuinchaa chun a suklang tah a, chu thuincha chu Pathien ei Sandamtu thupêk ang peia inkawltir ka nih."
"to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.","Tita, ringna hmunkhata ka nau taktak kuomah: Pa Pathien le Krista Isu ei Sandamtu kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna um raw se."
"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;","Hi lei hin Kret thlierkâra khan ka mâksan che a nih: thil sukfel bâkhai chu i sukfel pei theina ding le, thu ka pêk che ang khan khaw tinah upahai i ruotna dingin;"
"if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.","tukhawm, sawisêlbo, nuhmei pakhat nei, nauhai Pathien thu awi, inhawi chên taluona kawnga sawisêl hlaw naw, dân naw anga um naw, an ni ta phawt chun."
"For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;","Kohran hotu chu Pathien sum enkawltu a ni leiin sawisêlbo a ni ding a nih; mi kâwmaw, lunginrawm, uoin inrui hmang, mi vaw hmang, hlêpna inthieng nawa mi duâm a ni ding a ni nawh."
"but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;","Mi lâwm dân thiem, a ṭha tieng dit, lungril indiktak, mi fel, mi inthieng, insûm thei mi a ni lem ding a nih."
"holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.","Inchûktirna indik tak kawnga chun mi ân fui theina ding le, sêltuhai chu thiemnaw ân changtir theina dingin inchûktirna ang pei thu ringum chu pawm tlat mi a ni bawk ding a nih."
"For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,","Dân ang nawa um, thu hril mei meihai le hlêmtuhai tamtak an um sih a, sertanhai laia mi an ni deu tak."
"whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.","Chuonghai bau chu huppêk ding a nih, hlêpna inthieng naw dit leia thu inchûktir naw ding inchûk- tirin, mihai a sûng sûngin an chawk khawhlo hlak sih a."
"One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.","Anni laia mi an zâwlnei pakhat ngeiin, “Kret thlierkâra mihai chu khêlhlip dâm, sahrâng suol dâm, thabo buhehai an ni rawp hlak,” tiin a hril kha."
"This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,","Chu thu inhriettir chu ân dik a nih. Chuleiin, ringnaa chun an indik theina dingin natakin kâwk rawh."
"not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.","Judahai tienami thu le, thutak nghatsantuhai thupêkhai chu an ngaisak nawna dingin."
To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.,"Mi inthienghai ta ding chun ieng- kim ân thieng hlak; nisienlakhawm, mi inthieng naw le ring nawhai ta ding chun iengkhawm ân thieng hrim a um ngai nawh, an lungril le an sie le ṭha hrietna hrim khawm ân thieng ta nawh."
"They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.","“Pathien kan hriet,” tiin an ṭhang hlak a; nisienlakhawm, tirdak- um dâm, thu awi naw dâm, thil ṭha tinrêng thaw kawnga Pathien dit naw zâwnghai an nih, an thilthawin an inphatsan hlak sih a."
But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:,Nang ruok chun inchûktirna indiktak le inhme thu hril rawh.
"that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:","Putarhai chu insûm thei, inzâ- um, lungril feltak; ringna le hmangai- na le selnaa indiktak ni dingin infui rawh."
"that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;","Pitarhai khawm chu an um dân hrima Pathien inza mihai, hêktuhai le uoin he mihai ni lo a, thil ṭha tieng inchûktirtuhai an hung ni a,"
"that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,","la nunghâk deuhai chu an pasalhai hmangai ding dâm, an nau- hai hmangai ding dâm,"
"to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:","lungril feltaka um ding dâm, inthiengtaka um ding dâm, mâni in sin thaw ding dâm, ngilneia um ding dâm le, mâni pasalhai thu thua um dinga an thunun theina dingin infui rawh; Pathien thu chu hrilsieta a um nawna dingin."
the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:,Chuong ang bawkin la tlangvâl deuhai chu lungril feltak put dingin infui bawk rawh.
"in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,","Iengkimah thil ṭha thaw kawnga sukhmutuah insuklang la, în chûk- tirnaa chun, I takzie dâm, în zâumzie dâm,"
"sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.","i thu hril indikzie dâm sawisêl ruol lo chu ân lang a, khing tienga ṭhanghai laia miin ei chunga thil ṭha naw hrim hril ding an hriet naw leia an inzakna dingin."
"Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying;","Suokhai chu an puhai kuoma in- tuklût ding le, iengkima an lâwm- zâwnga um dingin infui rawh. An sêl el ding a ni nawh a,"
"not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.","kutkem hmang lo ding le, ringumna indik le ṭha po po suklang lemna dinga, Pathien ei Sandamtu inchûktirna thu chu iengkima an chawimawi theina dingin infui rawh."
"For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,",Mi po po sandamna dingin Pathien lunginsietna chu a hung inlang ta sih a.
"instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;","Pathien ngaisak nawna le, khawvêl châknahai bânsanin, tulai khawvêla hin insûm le feltak le Pathien ngaisakin ei um ding a nih ti mîn chûktirin,"
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;,beiseina lâwmum ei Pathien ropuitak Sandamtu Isu Krista ropui- na inlârna chu nghâk dingin a mîn chûktir a.
"who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.","Ama chun bawsietna po poa inthawka a mîn tlan theina dingin le, chi thlang bîk, thil ṭha thawa ṭha- hnemngaia, ama ta dinga a sukthieng theina dingin ei aiin ân pêk kha."
These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.,"Thuneitakin, chuonghai chu hril la, kâwk rawh. Tûkhawmin hmu- sit naw raw hai se che."
"Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,","Lalhai le thuneituhai kuoma intuklût ding dâm, thu awi ding dâm, thil ṭha tinrêng thawa inzo ding dâm,"
"to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.","tûkhawm hrilsiet naw ding dâm, kâwmaw insuo naw ding dâm, mi po po kuomah thuhnuoirawlna tinrêng suklanga nuninnêm ding dâmin anni inhriet suotir nâwk rawh."
"For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.","Eini khawm inhma khan invêt tak dâm, thu awi naw dâm, hlêma um dâm, châkna le lâwmna tinrêng rawng bâwl dâm, suol le îtthîk hmanga um dâm, tirdakum dâm, intheida tuo dâm ei ni sih a."
"But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien ei San- damtu ngilneizie le, mihriem chunga a hmangaizie chu a hung inlang lai khan,"
"not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,","thil feltaka thaw, eini ngeia thawhai chu, chu lei chun ni loin, Thlarau Inthieng siem tharna sâwpna le siem ṭhat nâwkna chun, a lunginsietna chun a mi sandam tah."
"which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;","Chun, Thlarau Inthieng chu Isu Krista ei sandamtu zâra chun nasa- takin ei chungah a buok kha."
"that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.","Chuongchun, a lunginsietnaa thiem inchangtira hung umin, cha- tuona hringna beiseina ang peiin rohluotu dinga siemin um thei ei tih."
"Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:","“Pathien ring tahai chun thil ṭha thaw pei dingin ngaituo raw se,” ti thu hi ring a um a nih, chuong thu chanchin chu huoitaka i hril tlat ka nuom a nih. Chuong thu chu mi- hriemhai ta dingin a ṭhain a ṭhahnem a nih."
"but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.","Nisienlakhawm, indawnna invêt dâm, thlatuhai thu suina dâm, insêlna dâm, Dân thua insuolna dâm chu nghatsan pei rawh; chuong chu thil ṭangkai naw, iengkhawm ni lo a ni sih a."
A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;,Ringdân tum nei mi chu vawikhat vawihni kâwk hnung chun dit naw rawh;
"knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.",chuong ang mi chu a fe pêtin a suol a ni ti in hriet deh; ama le ama thiemnaw inchangtir a ni sih a.
"When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.","Artema amanih, Tukik amanih i kuomah ka hung tir pha chun Nikopoliah ka kuomah hung hrâm hrâm rawh; chutaka chun thlasikah um ka tum sih a."
"Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.","Zena, dân hretu le, Apollo chun iengkhawm an tlâksam nawna dingin an inzinnaa chun ṭhahnemngaitakin ṭhangpui tâwl raw khai."
"And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.",Ei mihai khawm chun ra loa an um nawna dingin tlâksamna pawi- maw dinghaia chun thil ṭha thaw pei dingin inchûktir rawh.
All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.,Ka kuoma um po po hin chibai an bûk che. Ringnaa mi hmangai- tuhai kha chibai mi hung bûkpêk rawh. In rênga kuomah lunginsietna um raw se.
