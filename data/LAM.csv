"How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!","Iengtiziea khawpui khânga mi- puia sip kha khawsâwta ṭhung el am an tah a! Hnamhai laia khânga ropui kha, iem a tih a hmeithai ang a hung ni ta el chu! Rambunghai laia a lalnu ni hlak kha, chîn lem a hung ni ta el chu!"
"She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.","Zâna chun a ṭap ngâwi ngâwi a, a mitthli chu a bienga chun a luong a, A hmangaituhai po po lai tukhawm ama thlamuongtu ding a nei nawh; A ruolhai po po chun khaw- hlotakin ama an sawisak a; A hmêlmahai an hung ni vawng el tah ie."
"Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.","Sukrinumna le sal nina nasatak- ah Juda chu salin a fe tah a, Awi naw mihai laia chun a khawsa a, châwl hrim a hmu nawh; Ama sukrimsituhai po po chun hmun inchêptakah an nangchîng a."
"The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.","Inkhâwmpui hunbi neia chun tukhawm an hung naw leiin Zion lampui chun a sûn a, A dai kawtkhârhai po po chu râusanin a um a, a thiempuhai chu an inrûm a; A nunghâkhai chu sukrinumin an um a, ama khawm chu khâknaa chun a um a."
"Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.","A khingtuhai chu lu an hung na, a hmêlmahai chu an hung hlawtling a; A bawsietna tamtak el lei chun LALPAIN ama chu a sukrimsi sih a, A nau le têhai chu a hmêl- mahai hmaa chun salah an feh a."
"And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.","Zion nâunua inthawk chun a lal nina po po a fe hmang a, A lalhai khawm sakhi hlo petna ding hmu lohai ang an ni zo a; Anni hnawttuhai hmaa chun hrâtna neiloin an tlân a."
"Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.","Jerusalem chun sukrinuma a um nihaia le, a rimsik nihaia chun, a hriet zing, A tienlai inhawitirna po po kha; A mipuihai chu hmêlma kuta an tlûk lai chun an ṭhangpui nawh a, Hmêlmahai chun an hmuh a, râusana a umnaa chun an nuisan a."
"Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.","Jerusalem chu lungngaithlâk- tak elin a lo suol tah a; chuleiin, thil thieng naw ang a hung ni tah a; A saruokna chu an hmu leiin, ama lo inza hlaktuhai po po khawm khan an hmusit tah a; Anih, ân rûm a, nawtieng a nghah a."
"Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.","A tirdakumna chu a puonah a kai a, a tâwpna ding hrim a ngaituo nawh, Chuleiin, maktakelin a tlâwm a, thlamuongtu hrim a hmu nawh; En ta, aw LALPA, ka rimsikzie hi, ka hmêlma chu ama le ama ân chawimawi sih a!"
"The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly.","Hmêlma chun a thil hlu hai po po chungah a kut a phar a, Awinaw mi chu a hmun inthiengtaka chun a lût ti a hmu sih a, I mipui inkhâwmnaa lût lo dinga i khaphai ngei kha."
"All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.","A mihai po po chu an thuok dawngin bei an zawng a, An thil hluhai chu an hringna sukhrâtna dingin bu manah an pêk a; Aw LALPA, ngai la, en ta, hmusitum ka lo ni ta hi."
"Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.","Nangni a fe inlawn po pohai, in ta dingin iengkhawm a ni naw maw? Ngai unla, ka kuoma thaw anga, ka lungngaina ang hrim hi lungngaina a um am en ta u, LALPAIN a lunginsenna ṭium nia a mi sukrinumna ang hi."
"From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.","Chungtienga inthawkin ka ru sûngah mei a hung tir a, anni chu a hne tah a, Ka kehai ta dingin lên a phah a, a mi keikîr tah a; Râusanah a mi siem a, chauin ka um ni tin a."
"The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.","Ka bawsietnahai chu rîngkawlah a khitdeh a, Ama kuthai ngeiin a khit têl a; Ka rîngah ân bâttir a, ka hrâtna a châu tah a, Ka ido zo lohai kutah LALPA chun a mi pêk tah a."
The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.,"Keimaa ka mi hrâthai po po chu LALPA chun iengkhawm loah a siem a, Ka tlangvâlhai sukse dingin ka chungah pungkhâwmhai a ko a; Juda nau nunghâk inthieng chu LALPA chun uoin sâwrnaa angin a chîl a."
"For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.","Hieng thilhai lei hin ka ṭap a; ka mit chu tuiin a luong- thla a, Thlamuongtu ka lungril sukhartu ding kha keimaa inthawka a hlat êm leiin. Hmêlmahai chun an hne ta leiin, ka nauhai chu râusanin an um tah a."
"Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.","Zion chun a bânhai a phar vêl a, ama thlamuongtu ding tukhawm an um nawh, LALPA chun Jakob chungthua chun, ama vêl hnaia umhai po chu a hmêlmahai nîng an tih tiin thu a lo pêk tah a; Jerusalem chu anni laia chun thil thiengnaw ang a lo ni tah."
"Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.","LALPA chu a fel a nih; a thupêk dodâlin ka hel sih a; Ngai ta u, ka ngên cheu, nangni hnam po pohai, ka lungngaina hi en ta u, Ka nunghâkhai le ka tlangvâl- hai chu salah an fe tah a."
"I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls.","Ka hmangaituhai chu ka hei ko a, nisienlakhawm, an mi hlêm a, Ka thiempuhai le ka upahai chu khawpuia chun an bohmang tah a, An hringnahai sukhrât dinga bu an zawng lai chun."
"Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.","Ngai ta, aw LALPA, rimsiin ka um hi; ka phîng chu a buoi a; Ka lung chu ka sûnga chun ân her a, khawhlotakin ka lo hel ta sih a; Kawtthlêra chun kâwlhnâm chun a sukfahrah a, ina chun thina a um a."
"They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.","Ka thuok dawngna chu an hriet a, a mi thlamuong ding tukhawm an um nawh; Ka hmêlmahai po po chun ka buoina chu an lo hriet a, nangin i thaw a ni leiin an lâwm a; Ni i phuong ta chu la hung intlungtir i ta, anni khawm keia ang bawk nîng an tih."
"Let all their wickedness come before thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.","An khawhlonahai po po chu i hmaa chun hung tlung sienla, Ka bawsietnahai po po leia ka chunga i thaw ang khan an chunga khawm thaw ve rawh. Ka thuokdawngnahai chu tamtak an na, ka lungril khawm a chau a nih."
"How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.",Zion naunu chu LALPA chun a lunginsena iengtizie a sûmpuia ân khum am a na! Israel mawina chu vâna inthawkin hnuoiah a hung pei thlâk a; A lunginsen nia chun a ke innghatna khawm chu a hriet zing ta nawh.
"The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.","LALPA chun Jakob ram hluohai po po chu a lem zo vawng a, a lunginsiet nawh, Juda naunu kul dethai chu a lunginsen chun a keichim a; Hnuoiah a hung tethlûk a; Lalram le lalhai khawm chu a suktlâwm tah a."
"He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.","Lunginsenna ṭiumtakin Israel ki po po chu a sât thlâk a; Hmêlma hmaa inthawkin a kut changtieng chu a keitîm a; Meichawk angin Jakob chu, arêng arama kâng hmangin a raw tah a."
"He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire.","Hmêlma angin a thalngul chu a kuoi a, hmêlma angin a kut changtiengin a ngîr a, Zion naunu puon ina mita hmu inhâwkumhai po po chu a that vawng a; A lunginsenna chu mei angin a bunthlâk a,"
"The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.","LALPA chu hmêlma ang a hung ni tah a, Israel a lem zo a; A in ropuihai po po a lem zo a, a kul dethai a sukchim a, Juda naunua chun sûnna le lusûnna a sukpung bawk a."
"And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.","A biekbûk chu huon ang elin, a lâk hmang luipêk a; Ân khâwmna hmun chu a suksiet bawk a; LALPA chun Zionah, inkhâwmpui hunbi neihai le châwlnihai chu theinghila um dingin a siem a, A lunginsenna nasatna chun a thiempu le lal chu a hmusit tah a."
"The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly.","LALPA chun a mâichâm chu a peihâwnpêk a, a hmun inthieng khawm chu a sukthim a; A in ropui kulhai chu hmêlma kuta chun a pêkpêk bawk a. Inkhâwmpui hunbi nei nihai ang elin, LALPA ina chun an khêkri chêl chûl a,"
"Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.","LALPA chun Zion naunu kul chu suksiet a tum tah a; Rînin ân khi vawng tah a, suksietnaa inthawk chun a kut keitîm ta naw ni; Kul le a daihai chu ân sûntir a, an ngui hmunkhat ve ve a."
"Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.","A dâi kawtkhârhai chu hnuoiah an tlumhmang a; a kalna thîrhai chu a suktliekin a suksiet tah a; A lal le hotuhai chu dân um nawnaa hnamhai laia chun an um a; Anih, a zâwlneihai khawma LALPAA inthawka thilhmulâwk an hmu ta nawh."
"The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.","Zion naunu upahai chu hnuoi chungah an ṭhung a, an to ṭawk ṭawk a; An luhai chunga chun pilvut an vânvawr a; saiip puonin an inthuom a; Jerusalem nunghâkhai khawm hnuoi tieng an luhai an kûn el a nih."
"Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled; My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.","Ka mithai chun mitthli a tlasam hiel a, ka sûng tieng a buoi zo a, Ka mîtkhâ chu hnuoi chungah bunthlâkin a um a, ka mihai naunuhai suksietna lei chun; Naupang dâwnghai le nêne ne laihai chu kawtthlêrhaia chun an inkawn el a."
"They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, When their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.","An nuhai kuoma chun, “Bu le uoin khâwlai am a um a?” an tih a, Khawpui kawtthlêrhaia hliem anga an inkawn el lai le, An thlahai chu an nuhai ângsûnga an hringna a ṭuoi ral lai chu."
"What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?","Ieng am inhriettir ka cheh a, ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka ti cheh a, Aw Jerusalem naunu? Nang chu ka thlamuon theina ding chein, ieng tluk chau am ka ni ding a na, Aw Zion naunu nunghâk? I sietna chu tuisuoriet angin a lien a, tuin am sukdam thei a ti cheh a?"
"Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions; And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.","I zâwlneihai hlakin invêtna le teplo mei mei thilhmulâwkhai chu an hmupêk cheh a; I sal nina hung lakîr dingin, i suolna hlak an hmusuok thei si nawh a. Nanga ta dingin hlêmna le, teplo thu mei mei chau chu an hmupêk cheh a."
"All that pass by clap their hands at thee; They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?","Mi fe inlawnhai po po chun an kuthai an ben khum cheh a, Jerusalem naunu chunga hin an sisi a, an luhai an thin a, “Hi hi a ni maw mihaiin, Mawina famkimna, Leihnuoi po poa khawpui an ti chu?,” tiin."
"All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.","I hmêlmahai po po hlaka an bauhai an kâk khum pêkpûk cheh a; An sisi a, an ha an rawt a, “Ama chu ei lem zo tah, Ah, hi ni hi annâwm ei thlîr zing kha, ei hmusuok tah a, ei hmu ta hi,” an tih a."
"Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.","LALPA chun thaw a itum chu a thaw tah a; Tienlai nihaia thu a pêk thuhai chu a hung sukpuitling tah a; A pei thlâk tah a, a lunginsiet nawh a; Hmêlmahai chu lâwmin a siem tah a; I hmêlmahai ki chu a chawimawi ta a ni hi."
"Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.","An lungril chu LALPA kuomah a khêk a; Aw Zion naunu kul, sûn le zânin mitthli chu vadung angin inluongthlâktir rawh; Sâwldamna chu nang le nang inpe naw la; i mitthli luong chu ma naw raw se."
"Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.","Tho la, vêng ṭantirna huna chun, zânah khêk rawh; LALPA hmaihmaa chun i lung- ril chu tui angin bunthla la, I nau le têhai hringna dingin ama tienga chun i kuthai phar rawh, Chuong kawtthlêr tâwp tina phîngṭâma châuhai ta ding chun."
"See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?","En ta, Aw LALPA, ngai ta, hienga an kuoma i thawnahai hi! Nuhmeihai chun an rîla ra, nau- panghai, kuta tâwma umhai chu, an fâk el ding maw? LALPA hmun inthienga chun zâwlnei le thiempu chu that an ni el ding maw?"
"The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, and not pitied.","Mi a naupang le upa khawm chu kawtthlêra chun hnuoiah an zâl a; Ka nunghâkhai le ka tlangvâlhai chu kâwlhnâmah an tluh a; I lunginsenna nia chun anni chu i sukhlum a, Anni chu i that a, i lunginsiet nawh a,"
"Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side; And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of Jehovah’s anger: Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.","Inkhâwmpui hunbi neihai nia angin, “Ka lunginsenna chu kil tinah,” tiin nang chu i khêk a, LALPA lunginsenna nia chun a pumpel amanih, a um zing amanih tukhawm an um nawh: Ka tâwm a, ka dawn tleihai chu ka hmêlma chun a sukbohmang zo tah a."
I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.,"A lunginsenna hmawla hremna hmu tah mihriem chu ka na,"
"He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.","Ama chun a mi ṭhuoi a, varah ni loin, inthimah a mîn lâwntir a."
Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.,Keia chungah sûnnithlâkin a kut a thlâk takzet a.
My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.,"Ka taksa le ka vun chu a sukchuor a, ka ruhai chu a suktliek a."
"He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.","Ka chunga chun dai a rem tah a, nauhase nat le khâknain a mîn huon a."
"He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.","Sâwttaka lo thi tahai ang khan, hmun inthimahai chun a mîn chêngtir a."
"He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.","Ka vêlin a mîn huon a, ka suok thei nawna dingin; ka khaidiet chu a sukrik a."
"Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.","Anih, ka khêk a, ṭhangpuina ka ngên pha leh, ka hnina chu a lo dangkîr a."
He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.,"Ka lampuihai chu lung a saka sakhaiin ân huon a, ka lampuihai chu a sukkâwi a."
"He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.","Keia ta ding chun ama chu savawm mi lo inchân zingtu, hmun fienriela sakeibaknei ang chu a nih."
"He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.","Ka lampuihai chu a herkâwi a, a mi keinâwi vawng a; râusanin a mi siem tah a."
"He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.","A thalngul chu a kuoi a, thal ta dinga kâp dingah a mi sie tah a."
He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.,A thalbâwm thalhai chu ka diemnêmah a hung kâp lût a.
"I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.","Ka mihai ta dinga hrilinsîm le, ni tin tina an hla ka lo ni tah a."
"He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.","Ama chun khâknain a mi suksip a, sairam kha leh a mîn ṭhungtir tah a."
He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.,"Ka hahai chu lungtâthaiin a suknâwi a, pilvutin a mîn khum bawk a."
And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.,Nangin ka thla chu thlamuong- naa inthawka hlataka chun i sie hmang a; hlawtlingna khawm ka theinghil rau a.
"And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.","Kei chun, “Ka hrâtna le LALPAA inthawka ka beiseina chu a bohmang an ta hi,” ka tih a."
"Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.","Ka hrem tuorna le ka rimsikna, sairam thing le khâkna chu hre zing la."
"My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.","Ka lungril chun a hriet zing zing a, keimaa chun a kûn a."
This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.,"Hi hi ka lungrilah ka hung hrietsuok nâwkin, chuleiin, ka beisei hlak."
"It is of Jehovah’s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.","A lunginsietna chun a tlin naw naw leiin, LALPA zângaina leiin sukbohmangin ka um hri nawh a."
They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.,Zîng tinin an thar a; i ringumna chu a ropui a nih.
"Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.","Ka thla chun, “LALPA chu ka chanvo a na, chuleiin, amaa chun beisei ka tih,” a ta."
"Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.","Lungrila ama zawngtuhai le, ama nghâktuhai kuoma chun LALPA chu a ṭha a."
It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.,"LALPA sandamna chu miin an nghâk ṭâwk ṭâwk a, an beisei chu a ṭha a nih."
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.,Miin a tleirâwl laiin rîngkawl chu a phur chun a ṭha a nih.
"Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.","Ama chunga chun ân nghatpêk ta leiin, mâkhâtin ṭhung sienla, to zing raw se."
"Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.","A bau chu pilvuta chun sie sienla, chuongchun, beiseina a um thei rawi mawh."
Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.,"Ama bentu chu a bieng dawpêk sienla, kâwknaa sipa suksipin um raw se."
For the Lord will not cast off for ever.,LALPA chun kumkhuo chun a peihâwn âwm si nawh a.
"For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.","Lungngaina intlungtir hlak sien khawm, a zângaina hauzie ang peiin lunginsietna chu nei a tih."
"For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.","Nuom thu ngawtin a hremin, mihriem nauhai chu a suklungzîng ngai si nawh a."
"To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,",Hnuoia lungin intânghai po po kea sirde dingin.
"To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,","A chunghnungtak hmaihmaa mihriem thuneina herhmang ding le,"
"To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.","Mi chu a chungthua hnuoisie chu, LALPA chun rem a ti nawh."
"Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?","LALPAIN thu a pêk naw laia, a hril a, hung tlung el hlak chu tu am a na?"
Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?,A chunghnungtak baua inthawk chun thu sie le ṭha chu a suok ni lo am a nih?
"Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?",Iengleiin am mi hring chu mi a suolnahai leia hremna thua chier hlak a na?
"Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.","Ei lampuihai chu thaw ṭâl ei ta, zawngsuok ei ta, LALPA kuomah inher kîr nâwk ei tiu."
Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.,Vânhaia Pathien kuoma chun ei kuthai leh ei lungril chu chawisâng vêng ei tiu.
We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.,"Kan bawsiet a, kan hel tah a, nang chun i mi ngaidam nawh a."
"Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.","Lunginsennain în khum a, keini i mi hnawt a; i that a, i lunginsiet nawh a."
"Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.","Kan hninahai chu a fethleng thei nawna dingin, nang chu sûmpui chun în khum a."
Thou hast made us an offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.,"Hnamhai laia chun hnâwlthlâk le, hnâwlhnawk angah i mi siem tah a."
All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.,Kan hmêlma hai po po hlakin kan chungah an bau an ka pêkpûk a.
"Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.","Vânsam le ṭitna chu kan chungah a hung tlung a, buoina le bohmangna le chun."
"Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.","Ka mihai naunu suksieta a umna lei chun, ka mit chu vadungpui tui angin a luong a."
"Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,","Ka mit chu, ma loin, tâwp hun nei loin, ân bunthlah a;"
"Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.","LALPAIN vâna inthawka a hung en a, a hung hmu hmakhat chun."
"Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.","Ka khawpui naunuhai po po lei chun, ka mit chun ka thla chu a sukna a."
"They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.","A san um loa ka hmêlmahai chun, vate angin an mi hnawt rak rak a,"
"They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.","A hringin khurah an mi pei lût a, lung an mi hung thlâk khum a."
"Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.","Tuiin ka lu a chîm tlum a, “Ka bo a ni tah ie,” ka tih a."
"I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.","Khur sûng inhnuoitaka inthawk chun, aw LALPA, i hming ka hung ko a,"
"Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.","Ka râwl chu i hriet a, ka khêkna le, kân thuoknaah i na chu suksêt naw la."
"Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.","Nang ka hung ko ni chea chun i hung hnai a; “Ṭi naw rawh,” i ta."
"O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.","Aw LALPA, ka thla chungthu chu nangin i ṭan a, nangin ka hringna i sanhim a."
"O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.",Aw LALPA kân dik nawna i hmuh a; ka chungthu nangin rêl la.
Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.,"An phubalâknahai po po le, ka chunga an thiltum dânhai chu i hmu vawng kha."
"Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,","Aw LALPA, nangin an kâwknahai le, ka chunga an thiltum po po chu i hriet a."
"The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.","Ka chunga hung ṭuongtuhai hmûr le, ni tin tina ka chunga an ngairuotnahai chu."
"Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.","An ṭhung lai le an tho lai khawm chu nangin en la, an hla ka ni hi."
"Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.","Aw LALPA, an kuthaia an sinthaw ang peiin nangin thungna pe la."
"Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.","Anni kuoma i ṭawngsie, lungril ngarna chu nangin pe rawh."
"Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.","Nangin lunginsennain hnawt i ta, LALPA vânhai hnuoia inthawk chun sukbohmang i tih."
How is the gold become dim! how is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.,Rângkachak chu a vân thim ta de! Rângkachak inthieng khawm chu a va danglam ta de! Hmun inthieng lunghai chu kawtthlêr tâwp tina chun bunthlâkin a um a.
"The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!","Zion naupa hlutakhai rângkachak inthieng le hrilkhi theihai chu, Iem a tiha bêlhemtu kuta siem, pil bêlhai ang chaua ngainat an ni el chu!"
"Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.","Sihalhai hmana an nêne an keisuok a, an têhai an innêktir a; Ka mihai naunu ruok chu, thlalêra varîngseihai angin a khawhlo a ni ta hi."
"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.","Nautê nêne ne lai lei chu dangchâr leiin a dangah a kawp tlat a; Naupanghai chun bei an hnih a, mi tukhawm hlaka an khawipêk si nawh a."
They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.,"Dutuitaka fâk zawng hlaktuhai kha, kawtthlêrhaia bohmangin an um a; Sen inlâra enkawl tleihai khawm khan êkdûr chu an pawm a."
"For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.","Ka mihai naunu rîtlona chu Sodom suolna nêkin a nasa lem sih a; Chu chu mitkhapkâr loa pei- hâwnin a um a, a chunga chun kut hrim innghat a ni nawh."
"Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.","A miṭhahai chu vûr nêkin an inthieng lem a, nênetui nêkin an ngo lem a, Taksaa chun lunghluhai nêkin an sen lem a, An hmêl chu sapphir lung ang a nih."
"Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.","An hmai chu meihawl nêkin a dum lem a, kawtthlêrhaia chun hriet an ni nawh; An vun chu an ruhaia chun a kawp ri ngawt a, a vuoi a, hmawl ang el a nih."
"They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.","Kawlhnâma thata umhai chu phîngṭâmnaa thata umhai nêkin an hamṭha lem a, Lo thlairahai tlâksamnaa vuoka umin, hieng hai hi an luong hmang sih a."
The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.,Lunginsietna hau nuhmeihai kut chun an nauhai ngei chu an suong a; Ka mihai naunu suksieta a umnaa chun an buhai an nih.
"Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.","LALPA chun a ṭiumna chu a hung sukpuitling a, a lunginsenna ṭium chu a hung bunthlâk a; Ziona chun mei a sukchawk a, a lungphûmhai kâng hmangtu chu."
"The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.","Jerusalem dai kawtkhârhai chun hmêlma le râldo chu hung lût an tih ti, Hnuoia lalhai chun an ring nawh a, khawvêl hluotu- hai khawmin an ring nawh."
"It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.","A zâwlneihai suolnahai le a thiempuhai khawhlona, A sûnga mi fel thisen an insuona lei khan a nih."
"They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments.","Kawtthlêrhaia chun mitdel angin an invâk a, thisenin an pawrcheh a, Chuleiin, mi tukhawma an silfênhai chu an them thei nawh."
"Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here.","“Fe hmang ro, thieng nawhai,” tiin mihaiin an khêk khum a, “Tir hmang ro, Tir hmang ro, Tâwk naw ro”, tiin. Tlânsie le invai an hung ni tah a, Hnamhai lai chun mihaiin, Eini lai um ta naw raw hai se, an tih a."
"The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.","LALPA lunginsenna chun anni chu a ṭheh a, ngaisak nâwk ta naw ni; Thiempu mi nina chu an inza nawh a, upahai khawm an ditsak bawk nawh."
Our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.,"Ei ṭhangpuina thlâwn ennain ei mithai a kham zo a, Ei nghâknaa chun hnam sandam thei lo ding chu ei nghâk a."
"They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.","Ei kehnunghai an sui a, chuongchun, ei kawtthlêrhaia khawm ei fe thei nawh a; Ei tâwpna chu a hnai a, ei nihai chu suk tlung a na, ei tâwpna chu a hung tlung ta leiin."
"Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.","Eini mi hnawttuhai chu vâna mupui nêkin an hrât lem a, Tlânghai chunga chun an mi hnawt a, thlalêra chun eini an mîn chân a."
"The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.","Ei hnârkuo thuok, LALPA hrieknâl chu, an khursûnga chun an lâk a; “Ama hlim hnuoia chun hnamhai laia chun chêng ei tih,” ei tih a."
"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.","Uz rama um, nang aw Edom naunu, hlimin lâwm rawh; Nanga kuoma khawm no chu hung tlung a ta; inrui i ta; chun, nang chu ruokin insiem i tih."
"The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.","Aw Zion naunu, i suolna hremna chu a famkim ta a nih; Sal ninaa chun hrên zing ta naw ni cheh a, Aw Edom naunu, i rîtlona chu hung hrem a ta; I suolnahai chu hmusuok a tih."
"Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach.","Aw LALPA, kan chunga thil hung tlung hi hre zing rawh; Ngai la, kan muolphona hi en ta."
"Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens.","Kan rochan chu hnam danghai taah ân chang a, Kan inhai chu ram dang mihai kuomah."
We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows.,"Fahrahai le pa nei lohai kan na, Kan nuhai chu hmeithai ang an nih."
We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us.,"Kan tui chu tangka manah kan dâwn a, Kan thinghai khawm chu kan kuoma zawrin a um a."
"Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest.","A mi hnawttuhai chun kan rîngah an mi man a; Kan sâwl hle a, châwl kan hmu nawh."
"We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.","Kut chu Aigupta mihai kuomah kan daw a, Assuria mihai kuoma leh, beia suktlai dingin."
"Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities.","Kan thlatuhai chu an lo suol tah a, an um ta nawh a, Keiniin an khawhlona chu kan phur a nih."
Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand.,"Siehlawhai chun kan chungah ro an rêl a, An kuta inthawka mi sansuok ding tukhawm an um nawh."
"We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness.",Kan bei chu kan hringna lungngaithlâk leh kan hlawh a; Thlalêra kâwlhnâm lei chun.
"Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.","Kan vun chu ṭâmna kâng lumna lei chun, Meithuk ang elin a lum a."
"They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.","Nuhmeihai chu Zionah suollui an nih a, Nunghâkhai chu Juda khawpuihaiah an suol- lui a."
Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored.,Lal nauhai chu an kut ngeiin an khâi hlum a; Upahai hmâi inzâna hrim a um nawh.
The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood.,"Tlangvâlhai chu bu râwt dingin an lâk a, Naupanghai chu thing puta pêm ṭâng ṭângin an tluh a."
"The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music.","Upahai chun dai kawtkhâr an rielsan a, Tlangvâlhai chun an rimawihai chu an tâwpsan a."
The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning.,"Kan lungril hlimna a bo a, Kan lâmna chu lusûnaah ân chang a."
The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned.,"Kan lua inthawk lallukhum chu a tlah a, Kan chung a va rik de! kan lo suol ta sih a."
For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim;,Hi lei hin kan lungril chu a chau a; Hieng thilhai lei hin kan mithai chu ân thim a.
"For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it.","Zion tlâng chu râusana umin, Sihalhai chu a chungah an inlawn a."
"Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation.","Aw LALPA, nang chu kumkhuoin i um zing a; I lalṭhungpha khawm chu suon khata inthawka suon dang chenin a nih."
"Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, And forsake us so long time?","Iengdinga keini mi theinghil kumkhuoin, Chuong chen lâwm lâwm iengdinga mi nghatsan el am i na?"
"Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.","Aw LALPA, i kuom tieng mîn nghat kîrtir nâwk la, hung ngha kîr el kan tih, Tienlai hun ang khan kan nihai hung sukthar rawh!"
But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us.,"Annawleh, nangin i mi hnâwl let dêr el am a nih? Kan chungah i lung a sen êm êm el am a nih?"
