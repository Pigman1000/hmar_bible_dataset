"And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,","Lalpa chun Mosie a ko a, intuokna puon ina inthawkin a biek a,"
"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, even of the herd and of the flock.","“Israel thlahai chu hril la, an kuomah, ‘Nangni laia tukhawmin thilinhlân LALPA kuoma in inhlânin, ran, bâwng ruol le berâm ruol laia mi, in inhlân ding a nih."
"If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.","“A thilinhlân chu bâwng ruol laia mi, pumrawhmang thilinhlân a ni chun a chal, demkailo ân hlân ding a nih: ama chu LALPA hmaa pawm a ni theina dingin intuokna puon in kawt- khâr bula chun ân hlân ding a nih."
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.,"Pumrawhmang thilinhlân lu chunga chun a kut innghat a ta; chuongchun, a ta dingin intlanna siemna dingin pawmpêk ning a tih."
"And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.","LALPA hmaa chun bâwngchal that a ta; Aron naupasal thiempuhai chun thisen chu inhlân an ta, intuok- na puon in kawtkhâr bula mâichâm chu thisen chun the huol an tih."
"And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.","Pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu inhlip a ta, chan nawi a tih."
"And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;","Chun, thiempu Aron naupasal- hai chun mâichâma chun mei sieng an ta; mei chunga chun thing sep khâwm an tih."
"and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:","Aron naupasal thiempuhai chun sa tlin dâm, a lu dâm, a thâu dâm chu mâichâma chun mei chunga thinga chun sie fel diem an ta;"
"but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water. And the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","a sûnghai le a kehai ruok chu tuiin sâwp an ta; thiempu chun LALPA ta dinga rim inhniktak, mei hmanga thilinhlân pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin a pum chun mâi- châma chun a raw ding a nih."
"And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.","“A thilinhlân chu pumrawhmang thilinhlân dinga ran ruol laia mi, berâm amanih, kêl amanih a ni chun, a chal demkailo ân hlân ding a nih."
"And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.","Mâichâm sîr hmârtieng pangah LALPA hmaah that a ta, Aron nau- pasal thiempuhai chun mâichâm chu a thisen chun an the huol ding a nih."
"And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:","Chun, chan nawi a ta, a lu leh a thâu leh; thiempu chun mâichâm chunga mei chunga thinga chun sie fel diem a ta;"
"but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water. And the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","a sûnghai le a kehai ruok chu tuiin sâwp a ta, a pumin thiempu chun inhlân a ta, mâichâma chun a raw ding a nih; LALPA ta dinga riminhniktak, mei hmanga pumraw- hmang thilinhlân a nih."
"And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.","“LALPA ta dinga a thilinhlân chu vate tieng pumrawhmang thilin- hlân a ni chun, a thilinhlâna chun, vaṭhuhai amanih, pârvate amanih ân hlân ding a nih."
"And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;","Thiempu chun mâichâma chun hung chawi a ta, a lu chu her bawng a ta, mâichâma chun rawng a ta, a thisen chu mâichâm panga chun infar kangtir a tih."
"and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:","A awng chu a hmul le chun pei a ta, mâichâm kâwl, saktieng panga vut siena hmuna chun pei a tih."
"and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder. And the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","A thla le a thla inkârah thlêr a ta, a puma thlêr suok ruok chu ni loin; chun, thiempu chun mâichâmah, mei chunga thinga chun a raw ding a nih; chu chu LALPA ta dinga riminhniktak, mei hmanga thilinhlân, pumrawhmang thilinhlân a nih."
"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.","Aron naupasalhai Nadab le Abihu chun an mei lâkna chu an lâk ve veh a, chutaka chun meiling chu an sieh a, riminhnik chu an phul a, LALPA hmaah thu a pêk naw dântakin mei inthiengnaw an in- hlân a."
"And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, LALPA hmaa in- thawkin mei a hung suok a, anni chu a kâng hlum a, LALPA hmaa chun an thi tah a."
"Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “Hi hi a nih LALPAIN, ‘A mi hnaituhaia chun inthiengin inlang ka ta, mipui po po hmaa chun chawi- mawiin um ka tih,’ tiha a hril kha,” a tih a. Aron chu a to zing a."
"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.","Chun, Mosie chun Aron pami Uzziel naupa Misael le Elzaphan chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Hung hnai unla, in unauhai hi hmun inthienga inthawk hin riebûk puoah zâwn dawk ro,” a ta."
"So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.","Chuongchun, an hung hnai a, zakuo hâk pumin riebûk puoa chun, Mosie hril angin an zâwn dawk a."
"And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.","Mosie chun Aron kuoma le a naupasalhai Eleazar le Ithamar kuoma chun, “A sûnnain in sam inthla naw unla, in puonhai keithlêr bawk naw ro, chuong naw chun thi rawi in ta, mi po po chungah lung- insen rawi a tih; in unauhai Israel sûngkuo pumpuiin LALPA isêm chawk mei chu sûn lem raw se."
"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.","Chun, intuokna puon in kawt- khâra chun in suok ding a ni nawh, chuong naw chun thîng in tih; LALPA hriek chu in chungah a um sih a,” a ta. Chuongchun, Mosie thu ang chun an thawh tah a."
"And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,","LALPA chun Aron chu a biek a,"
"Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:","“Nang amanih, i naupasalhai amani khawmin, intuokna puon in sûnga in fe laiin uoin le zu hrim hrim dâwn naw ro, chuong naw chun thîng in tih; hi hi in thlahai chena kum- khaw dân ding nîng a tih."
"and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;","Chu chu ân thieng le ân thieng naw le, a thieng le a thieng naw in thlier theina ding le,"
and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses.,"LALPAIN Mosie hmanga an kuoma a hril, thupêkhai po po chu Israel thlahai în chûktir theina dingin nîng a tih,” tiin."
"And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;","Mosie chun Aron le a naupasal la dam hai, Eleazar le Ithamar kuoma chun, “LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlâna mi, fâkmi thilin- hlân lâk mahlahai chu la unla, mâichâm bulah chawl ṭhangloin fa ro, thil inthieng a ni sih a."
"and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.",LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlâna i chanpuol le i naupa- salhai chanpuol a ni leiin hmun inthiengah in fâk ding a nih; chuong anga chu thu pêk ka nih.
"And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.",A ir thêna thên le a mal dawm- kânga inhlân ruok chu hmun faiah in fâk ding a nih; nang le i naupasalhai le i naunuhmeihai leh; Israel thlahai inremna thilinhlân inthâwinaa i chanpuol le i naupasalhai chanpuola ruot a ni sih a.
"The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded.","A mal dawm kâng le a ir thên chu LALPA hmaa a thêna thên thilinhlân dingin mei hmanga thilin- hlân thâu leh an hung chawi ding a nih; chu chu nang le i naupasalhai leh kumkhuoa in chanpuol ding nîng a ta, LALPA thupêk ang khan,” a ta."
"And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,","Mosie chun suol inthâwina kêl chu nguntakin a zawng a; chun, ngai ta, an lo raw zo dêr tah a na; chuong- chun, Aron naupasal la dam Eleazar le Ithamar chunga chun a lungin- sen a,"
"Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?","“Iengdinga suol inthâwina chu hmun inthienga in fâk naw am a na? Hi hi thil inthieng tak, mipui rîtlona in phur theina dinga a pêk cheu, LALPA hmaa intlanna in isiempêk dinga a pêk cheu a ni sih a."
"Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.","Ngai ta u, a thisen chu hmun inthienga chun in lâk lût lêm; thu ka pêk ang khan hmun inthienga chun in fâk ngei ding a nih in sawnnaw,” tiin."
"And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?","Chun, Aron chun Mosie kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, vawisûn hin LALPA hmaah an suol inthâwina le, an pum- rawhmang thilinhlân chu an inhlân a na, hieng ang thil hi ka chungah a hung um el ta sih a!

"And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.",Mosien chu chu a hriet chun a lungawi tah a.
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a biek a,"
"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.",“Israel thlahai chu hril unla. ‘Hnuoi chunga um sa po po laia in fâk thei ding thil hringhai chu hienghai hi an nih:

And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.,"Chun, âwmbel chu a bel a; âwm- bela chun Urim le Thummim a sieh a."
"And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Lukhim khawm ân khimtir a; lukhim hmatieng chun rângkachak phêk suktuma um inchikna inthieng chu a bel a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.","Chun, Mosie chun hriek nâlmi chu a lâk a, biekbûk le a sûnga thil umhai po po chu a nâl a, a sukthieng tâwl a."
"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.","Chu hriek chun mâichâm chu vawi sari a theh a; mâichâm le a hmangruo po pohai, maihûn le a ṭhuthai dâm, sukthiengna dingin hriek a nâl a."
"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.","A sukthiengna dingin hriek nâlmi chu Aron lu chunga chun a bur a, a nâl tah a."
"And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Chun, Mosie chun Aron nau- pasalhai chu a hung ṭhuoi a, zakuo ân hâktir a, kâwng khitna chun anni chu a khit a, lukhum ân khumtir a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk angin."
And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.,"Chun, suol inthâwina ding bâwngchal chu a hung kei a, Aron le a naupasalhai chun, suol inthâwina ding bâwngchal lu chunga chun an kut an innghat a."
"And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.","Mosie chun a that a; thisen chu a lâk a, intlanna siemna dingin, mâichâm kihaia chun a kutpârin a vêlin a nâl a, mâichâm chu ân hlân thieng a, mâichâm bula chun thisen chu a bunthlâk a, a sukthieng tah a."
"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar.","A rîlbawtu po po dâm, a thin tuomtu duorda dâm, a kal pahni le a thâu dâm chu a lâk a, mâichâma chun Mosie chun a raw tah a."
"But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Bâwngchal chu a vun leh a sa leh, a êk leh riebûk puoah a rawh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.,"Pumrawhmang thilinhlân be- râmchal chu a hung inhlân a, Aron le a naupasalhai chun berâmchal lu chunga chun an kut an innghat a."
And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.,"Mosie chun a that a, mâichâm chu thisen chun a the huol a."
"And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.","Berâmchal chu a chan a, a lu le a sa tlinhai le a thâuhai chu a rawh a."
And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"A sûng le a kehai chu a sâwp a; berâmchal chu mâichâmah a pum chun a raw vawng tah a; chu chu rim inhnik dinga pumrawhmang thilin- hlân, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân chu a nih, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
"And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.","Chun, berâmchal dang, hlân- thiengna berâmchal chu a hang inhlân nâwk a; Aron le a naupasalhai chun berâmchal lu chunga chun an kut an innghat a."
"And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.","Mosie chun a that a, a thisen chu a lâk a, Aron nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, a kut changtieng kutpuia dâm, a ke changtieng kepuia dâm chun a nâl a."
"And he brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.","Chun,Mosie chun Aron naupa- salhai chu a ṭhuoi a, thisen chu an nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, an kut changtieng kutpuia dâm, an ke changtieng kepuia dâm chun a nâl a; chun, mâichâm chu thisen chun a the huol a."
"And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:","A thâu dâm, a mei thâu tak dâm, a rîlbawtu po po dâm chu, a thin tuomtu duorda le a kal pahni le a thâu dâm leh, a mal changtieng a lâk a."
"and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:","LALPA hmaa chawl ṭhanglo bei bâwma inthawk chun chawl ṭhang- lo bei pakhat le, hrieka hmet bei- phêk pakhat leh, beiphêk inphân pakhat leh a lâk a, sathâu chunga le a mal changtieng chunga chun a sieh a."
"and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.",A rêng chun Aron le a naupa- salhai kuta chun a sieh a; LALPA hmaa chun thêna thilinhlân dingin an thên a.
"And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","Chun, Mosie chun an kuta in- thawk chun a lâk a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chungah mâichâma chun a rawh a; chu chu riminhnik dinga suktumna thilinhlân, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân a nih."
"And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Chun, Mosie chun a ir chu a lâk a, LALPA hmaa thêna thilinhlân dingin a thên a, chu chu suktum- na berâmchala Mosie chanpuol a nih, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
"And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.","Mosie chun hriek nâlmia in- thawk le, mâichâma thisena mi chu a lâk a, chu chun Aron le a silfênhai a theh a, a naupasalhai le an silfênhai khawm; Aron le a silfênhai chu a hlân thieng a, a naupasalhai le an silfên- hai khawm."
"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.","Mosie chun Aron le a naupa- salhai kuoma chun, “Intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah sa kha suong unla, ‘Aron le a naupasalhai chun fa rawhai se,’ tiha thu pêka ka um angin inhlân thiengna leikhâwra bei le chun chutaka chun fa ro."
And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.,"Chun, sa le bei a la chuong chu meiah in raw ding a nih."
"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.","In inhlân thieng nihai a kim hmakhat chun, ni sari sûng chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâra inthawk chun suok naw tawp ro, hi inhlân thiengna hin ni sari sûng a aw ding a ni sih a."
"As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.",Tuta thaw ang hin intlanna siempêk ding cheuin LALPA chun thaw ding thu a pêk a nih.
"And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.","Intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bula chun ni sari, sûn le zân um zing in ta, in thi nawna dingin LALPA thupêk chu in zâwm ding a nih, chuong anga thu pêk chu ka nih,” a ta."
And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah commanded by Moses.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie hmanga thaw dinga thu a pêkhai po po chu Aron le a naupasalhai chun an thawh a."
"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;",A ni riet ni chun Mosie chun Aron le a naupasalhai le Israel upahai chu a ko a;
"and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.","Aron kuoma chun, “Suol in- thâwina dingin bâwngte a chal, le pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin berâmchal demkailo ve ve kei la, LALPA hmaa chun inhlân rawh."
"And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;","Chun, Israel thlahai kuoma chun, ‘Suol inthâwina dingin kêlchal, pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin bâwngte le berâmte kum khat mi ve ve demkailo ṭhieu,"
"and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you.","le bâwngchal le berâmchal LALPA hmaa inremna thilinhlân dinga inhlân dingin hung kei unla; hrieka hmet fâkmi thilinhlân leh, vawisûn hin in kuomah LALPA a hung inlang ding a nih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta."
And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.,"Chun, Mosien thu a pêk ang chun intuokna puon in tuola chun an hung kei a; chun, mi po po chun an va hnai a, LALPA hmaa chun an va ngîr a."
"And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.","Mosie chun, “Hi hi a nih, in thaw dinga LALPAIN thu a pêk cheu kha; chuongchun, LALPA ropuina chu nangni lai hung inlang a tih,” a ta."
"And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded.","Chun, Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “Mâichâm kha hung hnai la, i suol inthâwina dâm, i pumrawhmang thilinhlân dâm inhlân la; nangma ta ding le mipuihai ta dingin intlanna siem rawh; chun, mipuihai thilinhlân chu inhlân la, intlanna siempêk rawh, LALPAIN thu a pêk ta angin,” a tih a."
"So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.","Chun, Aron chun mâichâm chu a va hnai a, ama puola suol inthâwina bâwgte chu a that a."
"And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:","Aron naupasalhai chun thisen chu a kuoma chun an inhlân a, thisena chun a kutpâr chu ân chieh a, mâichâm kihaia chun a nâl a; thisen chu mâichâm bula chun a bunthlâk a;"
"but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","suol inthâwina thâu dâm, a kal dâm, a thin tuomtu duorda dâm chu mâichâm chunga chun a rawh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.,A sa le a vun chu riebûk puoah a rawh a.
"And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu a that a, Aron naupasalhai chun thisen chu ama an pêk a, ama chun mâichâm chu a the huol a."
"And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.","Pumrawhmang thilinhlân sa tlin chu a tum tumin a lu leh an pêk a, ama chun mâichâma chun a lo rawh a."
"And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.","A sûnghai le a kehai chu a sâwp a, mâichâm chunga chun pumraw- hmang thilinhlân leh a rawh a."
"And he presented the people’s oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.","Chun, mipuihai thilinhlân chu ân hlân a; mipuihai ta dinga suol inthâwina kêl chu a kei a, a that a, a hmaa mi ang bawk khan suol inthâwina ding chun ân hlân a."
"And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu ân hlân a, a dân ang peiin ân hlân a nih."
"And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.","Chun, fâkmi thilinhlân chu ân hlân a, chutaka mi chu a vei khatin a lâk a, zingkâr pumrawhmang thilin- hlân ti naw khawm chu mâichâma chun a raw bawk a."
"He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,","Mipui puola inremna inthâwina thilinhlân bâwngchal le berâmchal chu a that bawk a; Aron naupasalhai chun a thisen chu an pêk a, mâichâm chu a the huol a."
"and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:","Bâwngchal thâu le berâmchal thâu dam, a mei thâu tak dâm, a rîlbawtu dâm, a kal dâm, a thin tuom- tu duorda dâm chu an pêk bawk a."
"and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:",A thâu chu a ir chunga chun an sieh a; ama chun a thâu chu mâi- châma chun a lo rawh a.
and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.,"A ir le a mal changtieng ruok chu Aron chun LALPA hmaa thêna thilinhlân dingin a thên a, Mosie thupêk angin."
"And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.","Chun, Aron chun mipui tieng a bân a phar a, mal a sâwm tâwl a; suol inthâwina le pumrawhmang thilin- hlân le inremna thilinhlân ân hlân zo chun a hung ṭum a."
"And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.","Chun, Mosie le Aron chu in- tuokna puon ina chun an va lût a; an hung suok nâwk a, mipuihai chu mal an sâwm a; chun, LALPA ropuina chu mi po po chunga chun a hung inlang tah a."
"And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.","LALPA hmaa inthawk chun mei a hung suok a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân le a thâuhai chu mâichâma chun a kâng hmang tah a; chu chu mipui po poin an hmu chun an khêk dur dur a, an bawkkhup ta ṭhuop a."
