"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,","Paula, Krista Isua hringna um tiemna thu chu hril kawnga Pathien dit zâwnga Krista Isu tirko chun:"
"to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.","Ka nau dittak Timothe kuomah, Pathien ei Pa le Krista Isu ei Lalpa kuoma inthawka lunginsietna dâm, zângaina dâm, inremna dâm um raw se."
"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day","A mi thlatuhai chena sie le ṭha hrietna inthiengtak neia a rawng ka ibâwl hlak Pathien kuoma chun lâwmthu ka hril a nih; a sûn a zâna ka ṭawngṭainahaia chun ka hrietpui zing hlak che a,"
"longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;","lâwma ka sip theina dingin, i mitthlihai chu hre zingin hmu che ka nuom bêk bêk a nih."
"having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.","Ringna tak tak nangmaa um chu ka hriet zing sih a, chu ringna chu a tîrin i pi Loisiah a um a, i nu Eunikiah a um bawk a, nangmaa khawm a um ti indiktakin ka hriet."
"For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.","Chuleiin, ka kut innghat leia Pathien thilpêk nangmaa um kha mût chawk dingin ka hril nawn che a nih."
For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.,"Pathienin ṭitna thlarau a mi pêk nawh a, thilthawtheina le hmangaina le lungril feltak neina thlarau a mi pêk lem a ni sih a."
"Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;","Chuongchun, ei Lalpa thu in- hriettirna chu inzâpui naw la, ama mi intâng kei khawm hi mîn zâpui bawk naw rawh. Chanchin Ṭha leia rinum hi Pathien thilthawtheina ang angin mi tuorpui lem rawh."
"who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,","Ama chun ei thilthawhai ang ni loin, ama ruot le a lunginsietna ang lemin a mi sandam a, kona inthiengin a mi ko bawk a, chu lunginsietna chu leilung insieng hmâin Krista Isua chun ei kuoma pêk a ni tah;"
"but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,","chu chu a mi sandamtu Isu Krista inlârna leiin, tuhin suklangin a um tah. Ama chun thina chu sukbo- hmangin, Chanchin Ṭhain hringna le bohmang thei nawna a suklang tah;"
"whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.",chu Chanchin Ṭha thu chu inhriettir dingin tlâng insampuitu le tirko le inchûktirtua ruot ka nih.
"For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.","Chu lei chun a nih hieng thilhai khawm hi ka tuor chu, nisienla- khawm, kân zak nawh, ka iâwi chu ka hriet a, a kuoma ka înkawltir chu chû nia ding chun a vawng ṭha thei ti indiktakin ka hriet bawk a."
"Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.","Krista Isua um, ringna le hmangaina neiin thu indik dân ka bâua i hriethai kha nei tlat rawh."
That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.,"Thil ṭha i kuoma inkawltira um kha, ei sûnga Thlarau Inthieng um hin vawng ṭha rawh."
"This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.","Asia rama um po pohaiin an mi nghatsan ti ka hriet a, anni lai chun, Phugel le Hermogen an ṭhang a nih."
"The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;","Lalpa chun Onesiphora sûnghai kuomah zângaina pe raw se; ama chun a mi sukhar rawp a, ka khaidiet bun khawm a mîn zâpui si nawh a."
"but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me",Roma a um lai khan nguntakin a mi zawng suok ta lem a nih.
"(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.",(Chu nia chun Lalpa kuomah zângaina hmu dingin Lalpa chun ruot raw se) Ephesia rawng a bâwl nasat zie kha i hriet ta bawk a nih.
"Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.","Chuongchun, nang, ka nau, Krista Isua lunginsietna uma hin suknghetin um rawh."
"And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.","Chun, hretu tamtakhai laia ka bâua thu i hriethai kha, chuong chu, mi ringum, mi danghai inchûktir sâwng thei dinghai kuoma chun inkawltir rawh."
"Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.",Krista Isu sipai ṭhatak angin rinum mi tuorpui rawh.
No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.,"Sipaia um dinga thlangtu chu a suklâwm theina dingin, sipai tû- khawm indo laiin hi dam sûng khawsakna hin ân sukhnawk ngai nawh a."
"And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.","Chun, in ruolsieknahaia khawm chun mîn thaw sien khawm, dân angin a thaw naw chun inkhumtirin a um ngai nawh a."
The husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.,Loneitu sin inrim chu a ra chang hmasatu a ni ding a nih.
Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.,Ka thu hril hi ngaituo rawh; Lalpa chun kawng iengkimah hriet- theina a pêk ding che a ni sih a.
"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:","Isu Krista, David thlaa mi ka Chanchin Ṭha hril anga mithi laia inthawka thonâwk kha, hre zing rawh."
"wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.","Chu Chanchin Ṭha lei chun thil suksuoltu angin khuop hiel khawpin rinumhai ka tuor hlak a nih; nisienlakhawm, Pathien thu chu khuopin a um si nawh."
"Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.","Chuleiin, Krista Isua um san- damna chu, chatuona ropuina leh an hmu ve theina dingin, thlanghai lei chun iengkim ka tuor hlak."
"Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:","Hi thu hi ring a um a nih; “Ama leh ei thi ta si chun, Ama leh hring bawk ei tih;"
"if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:","Ei tuor chun, Ama leh ro rêl ei tih; Ama ei inphat chun, Ama khawmin mîn phat a tih;"
"if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.","Eini ringum loin um inla khawm, Ama chu ringumin a um zing a nih; Ama le ama ân phat thei si nawh a,” ti hi."
"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.","Chuong thu chu inhriet thartir zing la, thu mei meiah an insêl nawna dingin Lalpa mithmuah ṭhahnem- ngaitakin inhriettir rawh, chu chu iengkhawm a ṭhahnem nawh a, a ngaituhai ta dingin bohmangna a ni lem hlak."
"Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.","Sinthawtu mâni sinthaw inzâ- pui ngai nawtu angin, Pathien thutak indiktaka inchûktirin, Pathien pawm tlâka um dingin i theitâwp suo rawh."
"But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,","Amiruokchu, Pathien inza nawna tieng thu hril mei mei chu nghatsan hlak rawh; chuong ang mi chu Pathien ngâisak nawna tiengah nasa nâwk zuol an ta,"
and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus;,"an thu khawm chun pânse fâk angin fa pei a tih, anni lai chun Humenai le Philet an ṭhang a nih."
"men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.","Chuong mihai chun, “Tho- nâwkna chu tu khawm hin a ni dai tah,” tiin, thutak kawng chu an fe kâwisan a, mi ṭhenkhathai ringna an sukbo hlak."
"Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien lung- phûm nghet chu a la ngîr zing a, hi inchikna hi a nei a, “Lalpa chun ama tahai chu a hriet,” ti le, “Lalpa hming lam taphawt chun suol fe san raw se,” ti hi."
"Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.","Nisienlakhawm, in ropuia hin bûr le bêl rângkachak le tangkaruoa siem chau a um nawh a, thing le bepila siem khawm a um hlak a; ṭhenkhathai ngaihlut ding a um bawk a, ṭhenkhathai chu ngaihlut naw ding a um bawk."
"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.","Chuleiin, miin chuong thilhaia inthawk ân siekieng chun, bêl in- thieng, Lalpa hmang tlâk, sin thaw ṭha tinrênga in zosa, ngaihlut ding mi nîng a tih."
"But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.","Nisienlakhawm, tleirâwl châk- nahai chu tlânsan la, lungril in- thienga Lalpa lam taphawthai kuom- a chun felna dâm, ringna dâm, hmangaina dâm, inremna dâm hnawt ve rawh."
"But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.","Amiruokchu, indona a siem hlak ti hrein, insêlna invêt le, var nawahai chun ṭhang nuom naw."
"And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,","Lalpa suok chun do ding a ni si nawh a, mi po po chungah zaidamin, inchûktir thiemin, suol chungah dâwtheiin,"
"in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,","ama do dinga insiemhai chu thuhnuoirawl takin ân chûktir lem ding a nih; chuongchun, sima thutak an hung hriet theina dingin Pathienin hun remchâng a pêk el thei a nih;"
"and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.","Pathien dit zâwng thaw dingin Lalpa suoka manin, Diebol chânga inthawkin an suok thei hlau rawi mawh."
"But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.","Chun, hi hi hre rawh, ni nu- hnungahai chun hun khirtakhai hung um a tih."
"For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,","Mi mâni inhmangaitu dâm, tang- ka ngainatu dâm, intivei dâm, chapo dâm, Pathien hrilsetu dâm, nu le pa thuawi naw dâm, lâwm nachâng hre naw dâm, inthieng naw dâm,"
"without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,","hmangaina insiengpui nei naw dâm, mi nunrawng dâm, hêktu dâm, insûm thei naw dâm, mi ṭium dâm, ṭhat nuom dêr lo dâm,"
"traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;","vervêk dâm, thuhnung dâwn naw dâm, inngaihlu dâm, Pathien hma- ngai nêka mâni lâwmna chau hmangai lemtu dâm an ni ding a ni sih a."
"holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away.","Pathien ngaisak hawina nei an ta, nisienlakhawm, a thilthawtheina chu awi naw ni hai; chuong ang chu nghatsan rawh."
"For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,","Chuong ang laia mihai chu inahai lûta, suol rikphur nuhmei invêt deuhai sala man hlaktuhai kha an ni sih a;"
"ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.","chuong ang nuhmeihai chu châk- na tinrênga ṭhuoi hmang, inchûk rawp sia thutak hre phâk ngai naw an nih."
"And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.","Chun, Janni le Jambriin Mosie an kal ang khan, chuong mihai khawm chun thutak hi an kal hlak, lungril se tah, ringna kawnga chun Pathien dit naw zawng mi an nih."
"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.","Nisienlakhawm, chu chau chu thaw naw ni hai, an invêtzie mi po po kuomah a hung inlang ding a ni sih a, Janni le Jambri invêtzie ân lang ang khan."
"But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,","Nang ruok chun ka închûktirna dâm, ka um dân dâm, ka thiltum dâm, ka ringna dâm, ka dawtheina dâm, ka hmangaina dâm, ka selna dâm i hriet hle kha;"
"persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me.","mi mi suknawmnatna dâm, ka tuorna dâm leh; Antiokeia dâm, Ikonioma dâm, Lustraa dâm ka chunga thil hung tlunghai le suk- nawmnat ka tuorna kha, chuong po poa chun Lalpa chun a mi sandam ta sih a."
"Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.","Anih, tûkhawm Krista Isua Pathien ngaisaka um tum taphawt chun suknawmnatnahai tuor bawk an tih."
"But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.",Mi suol le hlêmtuhai ruok chu mihai hlêmin le hlêma umin suol zuol deu deu an tih.
"But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;","Nisienlakhawm, nang chu, tû kuoma inchûk am i ni ti hrein, i thil inchûkhai le i hriet chienghaia chun um zing rawh:"
and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.,Krista Isua ringna um lei chun sandamna hmu khawpa sukvar thei che Lekha Inthienghai chu i naupang laia inthawka hre tah i ni kha.
"Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness:","Pathien Lekha Thu tinrêng hi Pathien inthuok khuma pêk a nih a; inchûktir kawnga dâm, thiemnaw inchangtir kawnga dâm, kâwk kawnga dâm, felna inchûktir kawnga dâm a ṭhahnem bawk a nih;"
"that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.","Pathien mi chu, sin ṭha tinrêng thaw dinga kimtaka inthuomin, a famkim theina dingin."
"I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:","Pathien mithmu le, mi hring le mithi ngaituotu ding, Krista Isu mithmua chun, ân lârna le a ram sâlin, ṭhahnemngaitakin kân hriettir che:"
"preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.","Thu chu hril rawh, a huna khawm, a hun nawa dâm khawm thaw pei rawh; dawtheitaka inchûk- tir peiin an thiem nawna inhriettir la, infui la, kâwk rawh."
"For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;",Inchûktirna indik an ngai pei naw hun a la tlung ding a ni sih a; an nahai ân za leiin anni dit zâwng angin inchûktirtuhai an kuomah inkhâwm lem an tih.
"and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.","An na chu thutak tieng chun suksêt an ta, tienami thu tieng pêt tâng an tih."
"But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.","Nang ruok chu iengkimah fim- khur la, rinum tuor la, Chanchin Ṭha hriltu tieng sin thaw la, i rawng- bâwlna kha hlen rawh."
"For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.","Kei chu tu khawm hin inhlânin ka um zing ta sih a, ka suok pha a tlung tah."
"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:","Inruolsiekna ṭha chu ka thaw zo tah a, kân tlânsiekna lampui chu ka suo tah a, ringna chu ka vawng zing ta a nih."
"henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.","Tuhin chu felna lallukhum chu ka ta dingin siein a um tah a, chu chu Lalpa, ngaituotu feltak chun chu nia chun mi pêng a tih; ka kuoma chau ni loin, a hung inlang nâwkna ngaituhai po kuoma khawm."
Give diligence to come shortly unto me:,Inhmawtakin ka kuomah hung hrâm hrâm rawh.
"for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.","Dema chun tulai khawvêl hi a ngainat leiin a mi mâksan tah a. Thessalonikaah a fe ta sih a; Kreske chu Galati ramah a fe tah a, Tita chu Dalmati ramah a fe ta bawk a, Luka chau ka kuomah a um tah."
"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.","Marka kha fiel la, hung ṭhuoi ve rawh; ama chu rawngbâwl tieng ka ta dingin a ṭangkai sih a."
But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.,Tukik chu Ephesiah ka tir tah a.

Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:,"Alexander, dâr sung thiem kha ka chungah a suol bêk bêk hlak a nih;"
of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.,"Lalpa chun a thil thaw ang peiin thung a tih. A kuoma khan nang khawm fimkhurtakin um rawh, ei thu a kal nasa hle sih a."
"At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.","Ka thiemna thu ka hril hmasak ṭum chun tûkhawmin an mi ṭhangpui nawh, an mi thlathlam ta vawng lem a nih; a maw chu phurin um tâwl naw raw hai se."
"But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.","Chanchin Ṭha keima leia hril kima a um theina ding le, Jentailhai po poin an hriet theina dingin, Lalpa chun a mi ṭan a, a mi sukhrât ta lem a nih; chun sakeibaknei baua inthawk kha sansuokin ka lo um ta a nih."
"The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.","Lalpa chun suolna po poa inthawkin mi sansuok a ta, a vân rama chun himtakin mîn tlung a tih; ama chu chatuona ropuiin um raw se. Amen."
"Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.","Priska le Akuila, Onesiphora sûnghai le khan, chibai mi bûkpêk rawh."
Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.,"Erasta chu Korintha chun a um zing tah a, Trophim ruok chu Miletiah damnawin ka mâksan tah."
"Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.","Thlasik hmain hung hrâm hrâm rawh aw. Eubul hai, Puden hai, Lina hai, Klaudi hai, unau po pohai leh chibai an bûk che."
