"turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.","insawn ta unla, fe suok unla, Amor mihai tlâng rama le a kâwl vêl po po Arabaa dâm, tlâng rama dâm, phai rama dâm, Sim rama dâm, Kanaan mihai umna tuisuoriet pang- haia le Lebanona dâm, vadungpui Euphrates vadung chenin fe ro."

"How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?","Iengtin am keima khât chauin in buoina dâm, in phurrik dâm, in inngâwknahai chu phur zo ka ta?"
"Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.","In hnam laia mi, mi var, hmang- châng hre mi, chinchâng hre mi dâm inthlang suok unla, in chungah ho- tuah siem ka tih,’ tiin ka biek cheu a."
"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.","Chun, nangnîn, ‘I thil hril chu kan ta dingin a ṭha hle el,’ tiin in mi dawn a."
"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.","Chuongchun, in hnam hotuhai chu ka pawm a, in hnam laia mi, mi var, chinchâng hre mihai in chungah hotuah ka siem a, sâng chunga hotu dâm, za chunga hotu dâm, sâwmnga chunga hotu dâm, sâwm chunga hotu dâm, ṭhuoituhai khawm."
"And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.","Chuong lai chun in rorêltuhai kuoma chun, ‘In unauhai kâra thu chu ngaipêk unla, unau le unau kâra le ram danga mi, a umpui le inkâra khawm feltakin rêl ro."
"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.","Rorêlnaah thlierbîk in nei ding a ni nawh; mi chîn le mi lien inang zingin in ngaipêk ding a nih; tu- khawm in ṭi ding a ni nawh; rorêlna chu Pathien ta a ni sih a; in ta dinga thu khir taluo chu ka kuomah hung intlun hlak in ta, chu chu lo ngaituo hlak ka tih,’ tiin thu ka pêk a."
And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.,"Chun, chuong lai chun thil in thaw dân ding po poah thu ka pêk cheu a."
"And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.","“Chun, LALPAIN thu a mi pêk angin Horeb tlânga inthawk chun ei suok a, Amor mihai tlâng ram lampuia thlalêr lientak le râpthlâk- tak in hmu kha ei fe thleng vawng a, Kades-barneaa chun ei hung tlung a."

"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.","Chun, ka kuomah in hung vawng a, ‘A ram chu va enthla a, kan hang fena ding lampui le kan va fena ding khaw chinchâng dâm mi hung hril nâwk dingin kan hmaah mi va tir inlang,’ in tih a."

"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.","Chu rama thei dâm chu an lo a, an mi hung phurpêk a, chanchin an mi hung intlun a, ‘LALPA ei Pathienin ram a mi pêk chu ṭhatak a nih,’ an tih a."
"Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:","Nisienlakhawm, in hang fe nuom nawh a, LALPA in Pathien thupêk chu in helsan a;"

"Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.","Kei chun in kuomah, ‘Anni chu ṭi naw unla, huphur bawk naw ro."
"Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,","LALPA in Pathien in hmaṭhuoi- tu chun in mithmua Aigupta rama a thawpêk ta cheu po pohai ang khan thawpui a ti cheu a,"
"and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.","thlalêra khawm miin a nau a puok angin, LALPA in Pathien chun hi hmun in tlung chen hin lampui intluonin a puokzie cheu in hmu kha,’ ka tih a."
"Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,",Chuonghai po ka hril sa khawmin LALPA in Pathien chu in ring nawh;

"And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,","“Chun, LALPAIN in thu hril chu a lo hriet a, a lunginsen a,"
"Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,","‘Hi suon rilotaka mi hin chu pakhat bêk khawmin in pi le puhai pêk dinga ka înkhâmna ram ṭhatak chu hmu naw tawp an tih,"
"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.","Jephunne naupa Kaleb chau naw chun; ama chun chu hmûng a tih, a va sir tah ram chu ama le a nauhai pêng ka tih, ama chun LAL- PA chu titakzeta a zui tlat leiin,’ tiin ân khâm a."
"Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:","“Nangni leiin ka chunga khawm LALPA chu a lunginsen a, ‘Nang khawm hi chutaka chun lût naw ti nih."
"Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.","I rawngbâwltu Nun naupa Josua hi chu lût a tih, ama hi infui rawh; Israel mihai chu ân hluotir ding a nih."
"Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.","In nau le tehai, râllâkin la el an ta, in tihai hi, tuta a sie a ṭha la hre lo in nauhai hi lût an tih, anni chu pêng ka ta, hluong an tih."
"But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.","Nangni ruok chu insawn unla, Tuisuoriet Sen tiengah thlalêrah fe ro,’ tiin."
"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.","“Chun, nangnîn, ‘LALPA chung- ah kan lo suol a ni tah, hang fêng kan ta, LALPA kan Pathienin a mi pêk ang po poin hang thâwng kan tih,’ tiin in mi dawn a, chuong- chun, indona thuomhnaw in inbel seng a, tlânga hang fe chu in invaksier a."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.","Chun, LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Hang fe naw ro, hang thaw bawk naw ro; nangni lai ka um si nawh a, in hmêlmahai chun lo sukhlum pal rawi an ti cheu, an kuomah ti rawh,’ a mi tih a."
"So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.","Chu chu ka hril cheu a, in pawm nawh a, LALPA thupêk chu in helsan ta lem a, tlânga chun in hang fe hrâm tah a."
"And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.","Chun, chu tlânga um Amor mihai chun an lo thaw cheu a, khuoi mi hnawt ang elin an lo hnawt cheu a; Seira inthawka Horma chenin an that cheu a."
"And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.","Chun, in hung kîr nâwk a, LALPA hmaah in ṭap a; nisienla- khawm, LALPA chun in râwl chu a ngai nuom nawh a, a na khawm a hung sit nuom nawh."
"So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.","Chuleichun, Kades-a chun sâwttak in um a ni kha."
"At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.","“Chuong lai chun LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Lungphêk pahni a hmaa mi ang kha sut nâwk la, tlângah ka kuomah hung la, thingin bâwm siem rawh."
"And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.","Chun, kha hmaa lungphêk i suk- kawi tahaia thu chuong kha lung- phêkahai chun ziek ka ta; bâwma chun sieng i tih,’ a ta."
"So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.","Chuongchun, Sittim thingin bâwm chu ka siem a, a hmaa mi ang lungphêk pahni chu ka sut bawk a, lungphêk pahni chu chawiin tlânga chun ka hang feh a."
"And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me.","Chun, lungphêkhaia chun a hmasaa ziek ang, in pungkhâwm nia tlânga meia inthawka LALPAIN in kuoma a hril thupêk chu a ziek a, LALPA chun a mi pêk a."
"And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me.","Chun, tlânga inthawk chun ka hung thla a, lungphêk chu ka bâwm siema chun ka sieh a; LALPAIN thu a mi pêk angin chutaka chun a um ta zing a."
"(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.","(Chun, Israel thlahai chu Beeroth Bene-Jaakana inthawkin Mosera-ah an feh a; chutaka chun Aron chu a thih a, an phûm a, chun, a naupa Eleazarin a aiawin thiempu sin a thawh a."
"From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.","Chutaka inthawk chun Gudgoda- ah an feh a, chun, Gudgodaa inthawk chun vadunghai ram Jotbathaah an feh a."
"At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.","Chuong lai chun tu chena LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwn a, LALPA hmaa a rawng bâwl a, a hminga mal- sâwmpêktu ni dingin Levi chi chu a suktum a."
"Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)","Chuleiin, Levi chun a unauhai lai chun chanvo khawm, rochan khawm a nei nawh a; LALPA in Pathienin a kuoma a hril angin LALPA chu a rochan a nih)."
"And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee.","Chun, a hma ang bawk khan tlânga chun ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli ka um a; chun, chu ṭum khawm chun LALPAIN ka thu chu a ngai a, LALPA chun a sukbohmang nuom ta naw cheu a ni kha."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.","Chun, LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Tho la, mipuihai hma ṭhuoi rawh; anni pêk dinga an pi le puhai kuoma inkhâma ka tiem ram chu an hluo ding a nih,’ a tih a."
"And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,","“Khai le, Israel mihai, nangnia inthawka LALPA in Pathienin a phût chu ieng dang khawm a ni nawh a, in ṭhatna dinga LALPA in Pathien in ṭi a, a lampui po po chu hraw a, ama hmangai a, in lungril po po le in lungvar po poa LALPA in Pathien rawng bâwl a,"

Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.,"Chuleiin, ram dang mihai chu hmangai ve ro; nangni khawm Aigupta rama khan ram dang mi in ni kha."

"And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon",Chu ṭum chun Jordan râla um Amor mihai lal pahni kuta inthawk chun Arnon ruoma inthawka Hermon tlâng chenin ei lâk a;

"all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.","Phai ram khuo po po le Gilead ram po po le Basan ram po po leh, Basan rama Og ram khuo, Saleka le Edrei chenin ei lâk a."
"(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)","(Basan lal Og chau a nih, Repha mihai laia la um sun chu; a khum chu thîr a na, Ammon thlahai khuo Rabaa chun a la um zing a ni naw am a nih?

"And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:","“Chu ṭum chun, chu ram chu ei hluo a; Arnon ruom kâwla Aroera inthawkin Gilead tlâng ram chenve chenin, chutaka khaw umhai leh, Reuben mihai le Gad mihai ka pêk a;"

And I gave Gilead unto Machir.,"Chun, Gilead ram chu Makir ka pêk a."
"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border thereof, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;","Chun, Reuben mihai le Gad mihai chu Gileada inthawka Arnon ruom, ruom laitak chenin an ram chin dingin ka pêk a, Ammon thlahai ramri, Jabbok vadung chenin;"

"Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you.","Anni chu ṭi naw unla; a thaw- puitu cheu chu LALPA in Pathien a ni sih a,’ tiin thu ka pêk a."
"And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,","“Chu lai huna chun LALPA chu nasatakin ka ngên a,"

"Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.","Mîn kaitir la, Jordan râla ram ṭhatak, chu tlâng mâwitak le Lebanon chu mîn hmutir raw khai,’ tiin."
"But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni leiin LALPA chu ka chungah a lunginsen hleh a; ka thu chu a pawm nawh a, chuongchun, LALPA chun, ‘Hun ta raw se, hi thua hin mi be nâwk ta naw rawh."
"Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.","Pisga tlâng sîpah hang chuong la, thlangtienga dâm, hmârtienga dâm, simtienga dâm i mit hang inlên la, hang thlîr rawh; Jordan hi i kân naw ding a ni sih a."
"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.","Amiruokchu, Josua hi thu pe la, infui ṭha la, sukhrât rawh, hieng mipuihai hi a ṭhuoikai ding a na, i hang hmu ding ram chu ân hluotir ding a nih,’ a mi tih a."
So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.,"Chuongchun, Beth-peor ruoma khan ei um tah a ni kha."
"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee,","“Chun, hieng thil po po in hmaa kân umtir, malsâwmna le ṭawngsie hi in chungah a hung tlung a, LALPAIN a hnawt darna cheu hnam po pohai laia in hriet suok nâwk a,"

"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;","“Tuhin in hmaah hringna le ṭhatna, thina le thil ṭha naw ka sieh a."

And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.,"Chun, Mosien Israel mi po pohai kuomah hieng thu hi a va hril a."

"Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.","LALPA in Pathien chun in hma ṭhuoi a ta, hieng hnamhai hi sukbo- pêk a ti cheu a, an ram chu hluong in tih; chun, LALPAIN a lo hril ta angin Josua chun in hma ṭhuoi a tih."
"And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed.","LALPAIN Amor mihai lal hai, Sihon le Og le an ram a sukbohmang laia an chunga a thaw ang khan an chungah thâwng a tih."

"Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.","Hrâttak le huoitakin um unla, ṭi naw ro, anni chu ṭi bawk naw ro; in kuoma fe ve chu LALPA in Pathien a ni sih a; inhlâwsamtir naw ni cheu, mâk khawm mâksan naw tawp a ti cheu,” tiin."
"And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.","Chun, Mosie chun Josua chu a ko a, Israel mi po pohai mithmuah a kuomah, “Hrâttak le huoitakin um rawh, hieng mihai kuoma hin an pi le puhai LALPAIN inkhâma pêk a lo tiem ta rama chun i fe ve ding a nih, anni hi în hluotir ding a nih."
"And Jehovah, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.","I hmaṭhuoitu chu LALPA nîng a ta, i kuomah um pei a tih, inhlâw- samtir naw ni che a, mâk khawm mâksan naw tawp a ti che; ṭi naw la, zâm bawk naw rawh,” a tih a."
"And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel.","Chun, Mosie chun chu dân chu a ziek a, LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwntu Levi naupa, thiempuhai le Israel upahai po po chu a pêk a."
"And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,","Chuongchun, Mosie chun, “Kum sari kum, ngaidam kum taphawta bâwkte ruoiṭhea,"

"Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;","Mipuihai, nuhmei, pasal, in nau le tehai, in umpui ram dang mihai, anni chun an ngai a, an inchûk a, LALPA an Pathien chu an ṭi a, hi dân thu po po hi fîmkhurtaka an zâwm theina dingin;"

"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Ngai ta, i thi hun a hung hnai tah a; Josua chu ko la, inbiekna puon ina chun vân lang ro, thu ka pêk ding a nih,” a ta.

And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.,"LALPA chu puon ina chun sûm- ngîrin a hung inlâr a; chun, sûmngîr chu puon in kawtkhâr lu chunga chun a ngîr a."
"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, i pi le puhai kuomah i ininnghil ding a ni tah a, hieng mihai hi tho an ta, an va umna dinghai laia chu rama pathienhai kuoma chun uirêng an ta, mi nghatsan an ta, ka thuthlung an kuoma ka thlung chu bâwsieng an ta."
"Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?","Chu pha chun an chungah ka lung chawk a ta, nghatsan ka ta, inbîksan ka tih, bohmang an ta, thil ṭha naw le lunginzîngna tamtak an chungah tlung a tih; chuongchun, chu ni chun, ‘Ei Pathien eini lai a um naw leiin hieng thil ṭha naw ei chungah a hung tlung a ni naw am a nih?’ tîng an tih,"
"And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.",pathien dang tieng nghaa thil ṭha naw an thawhai po po lei chun an kuoma inthawkin kân thup ngei ngei ding a nih.
"Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.","Chuleiin, hla hi in ta dingin ziek la, Israel thlahai chu inchûktir rawh; Israel thlahai chungchâng thuah hi hla hi a mi hrietpuitu a ni theina dingin invawntir rawh."
"For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.","An pi le puhai kuoma inkhâma ka tiem, nênetui le khuoizua luong rama chun ka ṭhuoi a, fa le dâwna an um a, an tlaia an hung thâu pha meu chun pathien danghai kuom tieng nghâng an ta, an rawnghai bâwl an ta, mi hmusit an ta, ka thuthlunghai bâwsieng an tih."
"And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.","Thil ṭha naw le lunginzîngna tamtak an chunga a hung tlung pha chun, hi hla hi ân hrietsuoktirtu nîng a tih; (an thlahai baua inthawkin theinghil thei a ni âwm si nawh a); tuta kân khâmna rama ka ṭhuoi hma hrim khawmin an insuongtuo vêl dan chu ka hrietsa zing a nih,” a tih a."
"So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun chu hla chu, chu ni le le chun a ziek a, Israel thlahai chu ân chûktir a,"
"And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.","LALPA chun, Nun naupa, Josua chu ân fui a, “Seltak le huoitakin um rawh khai, Israel thlahai chu an kuomah inkhâma ka tiem rama chun i ṭhuoi lût ding a nih; chun, i kuomah um pei ka tih,” a tih a."
"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,","Mosien hieng dân thuhai hi lekhabua a ziek zo a, zo hieu a hung ni chun,"
"that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,","thuthlung bâwm zâwntu Levi mihai chu Mosie chun thu a pêk a,"

"For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.","Ka thi hnung chun nasatakin insuksieng in ta, ka thupêk cheu lampuia inthawk hin pêthmang in tih ti ka hriet zing a nih; chun, a tâwpa lem chu thil ṭha nawin tlâkbuok a ti cheu a; in kut thilthawa suklungsen dinga LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw in thaw ding leiin,” tiin."
"And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Israelhai pungkhâwm po po hrieta chun hi hla hi a tâwp chenin a hril vawng a:"
"Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.","“Na lo sit ro, vânhai ka hril ding a nih; Ka ṭawng bausuok leihnuoi hin lo ngai raw se,"

For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.,"LALPA hming chu ka phuong ding a nih, Ropuina chu ei Pathien pe ro."
"The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he.","“Lungpui chu, a thilthaw chu a fel famkim a; A lampui po po chu ân dik a nih. Pathien ringum, rîtlona nei lo, Fel le ṭha a nih."
"They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish; They are a perverse and crooked generation.","Ṭha nawtakin a chungah an thaw a, a nauhai an ni ta nawh an demkaina leiin, Suon bengtlanaw le kâwmaw an nih."
"Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee.","Aw mi invêt le var nawhai, Chuong ang chun maw LALPA chu in thung ding chu? Ama chu ân dintu che i pa, Siemtu che le inngîr dettu che ni lo am a nih?"

"When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel.","A Chunghnungtak chun hnamhai ram a pêk laia, Mihriem nauhai a ṭhe lai khan, Hnamhai ramri chu a khang a, Israel thlahai zât ang peiin."

"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock;","Hnuoi hmun insângahai chun ân chuongtir a, Loa thil rasuok chu a fâk hlak a; Lungpuia inthawka khuoizu ân dâwntir hlak a, Lung changa inthawka hriek leh."
"Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.","Bâwng nênetui inkhal, berâm nênetui, Berâmte thâuhai leh, Basan ram berâmchal le kêlhai, Bu inhniktak chihai leh; Grêp tui uoin i dâwn a."
"But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.","“Nisienlakhawm, Jesurun chu a hung hausa a, a hung hel a, A hung thâu a, a hung inchawm a, a hung nâm tah a; A siemtu Pathien a nghatsan a, A sandamna Lungpui chu a ngainêp a."
They moved him to jealousy with strange gods; With abominations provoked they him to anger.,"Ram dang pathienhai bein a thîkthu an chawktho a, Thil tirdakumin an chawk lungsen a."
"They sacrificed unto demons, which were no God, To gods that they knew not, To new gods that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not.","Pathien ni lo, khawhrihai kuomah an inthâwi a, An hriet ngai naw pathienhai kuomah, Vaihnurama um chau pathien tharhai, In pi in puhai iṭi ngai lohai kuoma chun."
"Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.","A thlatu che Lungpui chu i ngaisâng nawh a, A siemtu che Pathien i theinghil bawk."
"And Jehovah saw it, and abhorred them, Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.","“Chu chu LALPAIN a hmuh a, a theida a, A naunu le naupasalhai isuklungsenna leiin."
"And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness.","‘Inbîk hmangsan ka ta, Iengtin am an um hrim hrim,’ a ta. Suon rilo an nih, Ringum lo nauhai."
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.,"Pathien ni lo thilin ka thîkthu an chawktho a, An milimhaiin an mi suklungsen a; Chia hril lohaiin inthîktir ka ta, Hnam invêthaiin suklungsen ka tih."
"For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest Sheol, And devoureth the earth with its increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.","Ka lunginsen a chawk a, Seol mawng chenin a kâng a, Leihnuoi, a rasuok pumin a kâng zo, Tlâng innghatna dâm a kâng a."
I will heap evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them:,"“An chungah sietna intieng khâwm ka ta, An chungah thal inthlâng ka tih."
"They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.","Phîngṭamin inrâwp an ta, meipui le sietna namên loin kâng hmang an tih; An chungah ramsa hahai tir ka ta. Pilvuta invâk mihai tûr leh."
"Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; It shall destroy both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.","Puotiengah kâwlhnâmin thîng an ta, Sûngtienga chun thlabârin, Nunghâk, tlangvâl, nêne ne lai, Lua kêlsam ṭohai chenin."
"I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;","‘Sukdar vawng ka ta, Mihriem laia anni hriet zingna chu sukbohmang dai ka tih,’ lo ti hiel tâng ka tih."
"Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Jehovah hath not done all this.","An hmêlmahai chu ngaisuolin, ‘Kan kut chu dawm sângin a um tah, Hieng po po hi LALPA ithaw a ni tawp nawh,’ hmêlma lunginsen chun tîng an tih ti ṭi naw lang chu."
"For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.","Varna bo hnam an na, Annia chun hrietthiemna a um nawh."
"Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!","Aw, var hai sien chu hieng hi hrethiem an ta, An hihnung thil ding an ngaituo ding bah."
"How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up?","Iengtin am pakhatin sâng hnawt a ta, Pahniin sîng intlânsiettir an ta, An Lungpuiin anni a zawr a, LALPAIN anni ân hlân a ni si naw chun?"
"For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.","An Lungpui chu ei Lungpui ang a ni nawh a, Ei hmêlmahai ngei ngaidân khawma."
"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:","An grêphrui chu Sodom grêphrui, Gomorra rama mi a nih; An grêphai chu tûr grêp a nih. A bâwrhai chu a khâ."
"Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of asps.","An uoinhai chu drakon tûr le, Rûlriel tûr hrâttak a nih."
"Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?","“Chu chu ka ikhâwlkhâwm, Ka robâwma châr khum chie a ni naw am a nih?"
"Vengeance is mine, and recompense, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.","Phuba lâk le thung chu keima thaw ding a nih, An kalbi ân tleu pha chun, An sietna ni chu a hung hnai an tah a, An chunga thil tlung dinghai chu hung tlung vak a tih."
"For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself for his servants; When he seeth that their power is gone, And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.","LALPA chun a mihai ro a rêl ding a na, A siehlawhai khawm thawpêk a tih; An thilthawtheina inhmang a, Khuokhir le khir naw tukhawm um dêr loa a hmu pha chun."
"And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;","Hieng ang hin tîng a tih, ‘Khâwlai am an pathien, An ring lungpui chu,"
"Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection.","An inthawina thâu fatu, An dâwn ding thilinhlân uoin dâwntuhai chu? Hung thoin hung ṭhangpui sienla cheu, Nangni humtu hung ni raw se."
"See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.","“Kei, keima ngei ka ni hre unla, Pathien dang an um nawh; Ka sukhlum hlak a, ka sukhring bawk hlak; Ka sukhliem hlak a, ka sukdam bawk hlak; Ka kuta inthawka mi lapêk thei hrim hrim an um nawh."
"For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever,","Vân tieng ka kut ka phar a, Ka hringna sâlin ka hril a,"
"If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me.","Ka kâwlhnâm tle ka tâtngei a, Ka kutin rorêlna ka kawl chun, Ka hmêlmahai chungah phuba lâng ka ta; A mi theidatuhai chu thung ka tih."
"I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy.","Ka thalhai chu thisenin sukrui ka ta, Ka kâwlhnâm chun thisen lem a tih; Thathai le salhai thisen le Hmêlma hotuhai lu chenin,” tiin."
"Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: For he will avenge the blood of his servants, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.","“Aw, nangni hnam tinhai, A siehlawhai thisen phuba chu a lâk ding a nih; Ama dotuhai chungah phuba a lâk ding a nih, A ram le a mihai ta dingin inremna famkim siem a tih,”"
"And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.","Mipuihai na hrietah chuong hla thu po po chu Mosien a hril vawng a, ama le Nun naupa Hosea leh."
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;,"Chun, Mosien chuong thu po po chu Israel mi po po kuoma a hril zo chun, an kuomah,"
"and he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.","“Tuta in kuoma ka thu in- hriettira cheu hin, in lungril innghat tlat unla, hieng dân thuhai po po hi fîmkhurtaka zâwm dingin in nauhai chu thu pe ro."
"For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.","In ta dingin thil teplo mei mei a ni nawh a, in hringna a ni sih a; chun, hieng thil thaw hin, hluo ding Jordan in va kân rama chun in dam sâwt ding a nih,” a ta."
"And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,","Chun, chu ni vêk chun LALPA- IN Mosie a biek a,"
"Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;","“Moab rama Jeriko zâwna Abarim tlângdung Nebo tlânga chun hang fe la, Israel thlahai hluo dinga ka pêk Kanaan ram chu hang thlîr rawh."
"and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:","Chuongchun, i unaupa Aron Hor tlângah a thih a, a chihai kuoma ṭhuoi a ni ta ang bawk khan i hang lâwnna tlânga chun thîng i ta; i chihai kuoma ṭhuoi nîng i tih;"
"because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.",Zin thlalêra Kades-a Meriba tuia Israel thlahai laia ka chunga in suol lei le Israel thlahai laia in mi chawimawi naw lei khan.
For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.,"Ram chu hang hmûng i ta, nisienlakhawm, Israel thlahai ka pêk rama chun lût naw ti nih,” tiin."
"And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.",Hi malsâwmna hin a nih Pathien mi Mosie chun a thi hmaa Israel thlahai mal a sâwm chu:

"Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.","Reuben chu dam zing sienla, thi loin, A mihai chu tlâwm hle hai sien khawm,” ti hi."

Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire;,"“Chuleiin, fîmkhur hle ro; Horeb tlânga meia inthawka LALPA- IN a hung biek ni cheu khan hmêl- hmang iengkhawm in hmu si nawh a;"

Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;,"Chun, Mosie chun suotieng pangah khuo pathum Jordan râlah a ruot a,"

"And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which Jehovah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.","LALPA chun lungphêk pahni, Pathien kutpâra ziek chu a mi pêk a; chutaka chun in pungkhâwm nia tlâng chunga meia inthawka LALPA- IN in kuoma thu a hrilhai po po kha a chuong vawng a."
"And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.","Ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli hnung- a chun lungphêk pahni, thuthlungna lungphêk chu a mi pêk a."
"And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.","LALPA chun ka kuomah, ‘Tho la, hi taka inthawk hin fe thla vat rawh, Aigupta rama i ṭhuoi suok i mihai chu an insuksiet zo ta khu; hraw dinga thu ka pêk kawnga inthawk chun an pêt ta pang el a, milim sung fâwm an ta dingin an siem el ta khu,’ a tih a."

"And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.","Chun, ka hei thlîr a, LALPA in Pathien chunga chun in lo suol tah a, bâwngte lim sung fâwm in insiem a, LALPAIN thu a pêk cheu lampuia inthawk chun in pêt pang el tah ti ka hmuh a."
"And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.","Chun, lungphêk pahni chu ka dawm a, ka kut khinghnia inthawk chun ka pei a, in mithmua chun ka sukkawi a."
"And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.","Chun, kha hmaa ka thaw ang khan ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli LALPA hmaah ka bawkkhup a; a lung suksen dinga LALPA mithmua in thil suksuol tah in suolna po po leiin bei khawm ka fâk nawh a, tui khawm ka dâwn bawk nawh."
"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you.

"And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.","In suolna leia in siem bâwngte lim chu ka lâk a, ka rawh a, ka suknâwi a, pilvut angin ka rawt- nawi dar a; a phit chu tlânga in- thawka vadung hung luonga chun ka phul a."
"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.","“Taberaa dâm, Massaa dâm, Kibroth-hattaavaa dâm khawm LALPA chu in suklungsen a."
"And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.","Chun, LALPAIN, ‘Ram ka pêk cheu chu hang hluo ro’, tiha Kades- barneaa inthawka a tir lai cheu khan LALPA in Pathien thupêk chu in helsan a, ama chu in ring nawh a, a râwl khawm in ngai bawk nawh a."
