The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.,"Ninevi khaw phurrik chu, Elkos mi Nahum inlârna hmu bu chu."
"Jehovah is a jealous God and avengeth; Jehovah avengeth and is full of wrath; Jehovah taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.","LALPA chu thîkthusie Pathien le phuba lâk hmang a nih; LALPA chun phuba a lâk a, lunginsennain a sip a nih; LALPA chun ama dotuhai chungah phuba a lâk a, a hmêlmahai ta ding chun lunginsenna ân khâwl- khâwm a nih."
"Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty: Jehovah hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.","LALPA chu a lung ân uoi a, nasataka thilthawthei a na, mi suol chu thiem inchangtir hrim hrim naw ni; LALPA chun thlivira le thlipuia chun lampui a nei a, sûmhai chu a kea pilvut a nih."
"He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.","Tuisuoriet chu a kâwk a, a suk- kangintana, vadunghai po po khawm a sukkangintan zo a, Basan ram le Karmel tlâng an châu a, Lebanon tlâng pâr chu a châu a nih."
"The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.","Tlâng lienhai chu ama leiin an inhnîng a, tlâng chînhai chu an intuihmang a; a hmaa chun hnuoi hi ân thin a, anih, khawvêl le a sûnga um po pohai le chun."
"Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.","A lungninawna hmaa chun tu am ngîr thei an ta, a lunginsenna nasa- taka chun tu am um thei an ta? A lunginsenna chu mei anga bunthlâk a na, lungpuihai chu a sukkawi vawng a nih."
"Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.","LALPA chu a ṭha a, lunginzîng nia chun kul nghet a nih, amaa an ringna innghattuhai chu a hriet."
"But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.","Amiruokchu, tui lien luong liem- na hmangin chu hmun bohmang vawngna chu intlungtir a ta, hmêl- mahai chu inthimnaah hnawt lût a tih."
What do ye devise against Jehovah? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.,LALPA kalin ieng am in ngaituoh a? Tâwp râwtna ân tlungtir ding a nih: rinum vawi hnina tlung naw nih.
"For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.","Hling bawn anga umin an uoin dâwn chun chie hu hnêp angin um sienla khawm, bupâwl ṭâwl ang ela sukbohmang vawng nîng an tih."
"There is one gone forth out of thee, that deviseth evil against Jehovah, that counselleth wickedness.","Nangmaa suok mi pakhat LALPA kalna thil suol ngaituotu, rîtlona thurâwntu a um a."
"Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih: “An hrât thei tâwpin hrât hai sienla khawm, tam khawm tamtak ni hai sien khawm, chuongsa khawm chun vât thlûkin um an ta, bohmang an tih. Lo sukrimsi ta lang che khawm sukrimsi nâwk ta naw ning che."
"And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.","Tuhin chu i kuoma inthawkin a rîngkawl chu suktliek ka ta, nangma khuopna hruihai chu suktan vawng ka tih."
"And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.","LALPA chun i chungchâng thuah thu a pêk a, i hming chu chi anga thê ni ta naw nih; i pathien ina inthawka milim siemfâwm le milim sunghai chu sukbohmang ka tih; i thlân chu siem ka tih, i suol sih a,” tiin."
"Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.","Tlânghaia chanchin ṭha in- tluna, inremna thu tlânginsampui- tuhai ke chu en ta! Aw Juda, i ruoi- ṭhenahai chu inser la, i thutiemhai chu sukpuitling rawh; mi rilo chun a pal thleng nâwk ta âwm si naw cheh a, sukbohmang dêr a ni tah a nih."
"He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.","Sukkawinâwitu chu i hmai- hmaa chun a hung suok ie, kul- bîng chu enkawl la, lampui chu vêng rawh, i kâwng chu sukngar la, i thil- thawtheina chu hrâttakin siem ṭha rawh."
"For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.","Israelhai ropuina angin Jakob- hai ropuina chu LALPA chun ân ngîr nâwk sih a; sukruoktuhaiin anni chu an sukruok zo tah a, an grêp kauhai an suksiet zo ta sih a."
"The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.","A mi hrâthai phaw chu a sen a, mi huoisenhai chu a sen inlârin an inthuom a, an inbuotsaina nia chun tawlailîrhai chu kâpathîr tlêtin a tle zawr zawr a, feihai chu râpthlâktakin ân lap zawk zawk a nih."
The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.,"Tawlailîrhai chu kawtthlêra chun an tlân bur bur a, lamlien lien- haia chun an insuk sawk sawk a, meiser angin an inlang a, kâwlinlep angin an tlân thuok thuok a nih."
"He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.","A mi lienhai chu a hrietsuok a, an fe inruol chu an pêm a; kul bang tieng pan chun an inhmawh a, thil phên ding an siem a."
"The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.","Vadung kawtkhârhai chu hawng a na, lal in chu sukramin a um a."
"And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.","Chun, Huzzab chu an hlîp a, an fe hmangpui a, a suoknuhai chun an âwm inchumin vaṭhu inhrâm ang elin an ṭah a."
"But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, they cry; but none looketh back.","Tienlaia inthawk tah Ninevi khuo hi dîl ang a na; amiruokchu, an tlân hmang a, “Ngîr ro, ngir ro,” tiin an ko a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawm an ngha kîr nawh."
"Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.","Tangkaruo râllâkhai chu lâkpêk unla, rângkachak râllâk sumhai chu lâkpêk ro; thil sêkkhâwl le thuom- hnaw ṭha po po ropuizie chun tâwpintai a nei si nawh."
"She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.","Sukruokin a um a, a ruok dêr a, a rêm dêr a nih, lungril chu ân tui- hmang a, khûphai chu ân vuoktuoh a, kâwng po po chu a na ngawi ngawi a, an rênga hmêl chu a dâng zo vawng a nih."
"Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?","Tukhawm isukṭit loa an umna, sakeibakneichal dâm, sakeibaknei- pui dâm, an fe vêlna sakeibaknei bu zâwl le sakeibakneitehaiin an fâkna hmun chu khâw lai am a na?"
"The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.","Sakeibakneichal chun a têhai khawp tâwk a keinâwi a, sakeibak- neipuihai ta dingin a se hlum a, a pûkhai chu a sasein a suksip a, a bu zâwlhai chu saruong kei nâwiin."
"Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.","Sipaihai LALPA chun, “Ngai ta, ka do che a nih, i tawlailîrhai chu raw khu hlut hlut ka ta, i sakeibaknei têhai chu kâwlhnâmin bohmang an tih; chun, hnuoia i sase hi suktâwp ka ta, i palaihai râwl chu hriet ni ta naw ni,” a ta."
Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.,Thisen insuo hmang khawpui chu a chung a rik ie! Khêl le inrawk- nain a sip vawng a; an sase chu a chatlak nawh.
"The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,","Vuokna vai rîk dâm, tawlailîr ke innghawr ri dâm, sakawr inchâwm dâm, tawlailîr tlân tlut tlut dâm leh;"
"the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble upon their bodies;—","sakawr chung chuong mi, sakawr- a chuong dâm, kâwlhnâm tle zawr zawr dâm, fei tle pawp pawp dâm le, mi that um rem rum dâm, ruong um rei rui dâm leh; ruong chu tâwp ti hrim a nei nawh, an ruong haia chun an insui a;"
"because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.","chuong chu, nawchizawr hmêl ṭha, dawithiemnu, a uiretna leia hnam zawr a, dawi chîngna leia sûngkuo zawrtu uiretna nasatak leia hung um a nih."
"Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, Ngai ta, ka do che a nih; i hmai tieng i puon hlîm ka ta; i saruokna hnamhai kuoma le i muol- phona lal ramhai kuomah inentir ka tih."
"And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.","Hmunhnawk tirdakumtakin thêng ka ti cheh a, inzakumtakin siem ka ti che a, ennuom dingin sieng ka ti che."
"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?","Chun, hieng ang hi hung nîng a ta, a hmu taphawt che chu i kuoma inthawkin tlân hmang an tih. Ninevi khuo chu a hung tâwp tah a nih; tuin am sûn a ta? Khâwlaia inthawkin am i ta dingin lungmuongna ei zawng ding chu aw! tîng an tih."
"Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?","Vadunghai kâra um, No-amon, a vêla tuiin ân huol, a kul dinga tui- pui hmanga, a kul bang ding tui- pui nei nêk khan i ṭha lem am a nih?"
"Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.","Ethiopia le Aigupta chu a hrâtna a na, chu chu tâwp chin nei lo a nih; Put le Lubim chu nangma ṭhangpui- tuhai an nih."
"Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.","Chuong sa khawm chun lâk hmangin a um a, salah ân tâng a: kawtthlêr tin tâwpah a naupangtehai chu an pei nawipêk a; a mi ṭhahai ta dingin ai an sân a, a mi lienhai po po chu khaidieta khuop an nih."
Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy.,"Nang khawm inrui bawk i ta, thuphmangin um i tih; hmêlma leiin kul det zawng bawk i tih."
"All thy fortresses shall be like fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.","I kul po po chu theichang kûng, ra hmin hmasa put ang nîng an ta, an inhnîng phawt chun a fatu bauah an tla lût hlak."
"Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars.","Ngai ta, i sûnga i mipuihai chu nuhmei an na, i hmêlmahai ta dingin i ram kawtkhâr chu ân hawng huoi a, în kalna thîr tluonhai chu meiin a kâng hmang a nih."
"Draw thee water for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the brickkiln.","Inhuol vêla i um sûnga dingin tui chawi la, i kulhai sukdet rawh; pilpawk umnaa chun fe la, lung chârna chu chîl la, ṭêklei râwna thuk chu sukdet rawh."
There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall devour thee like the canker-worm: make thyself many as the canker-worm; make thyself many as the locust.,"Chutaka chun meiin kâng hmang a ti cheh a, kâwlhnâmin sât hlum a ti che, khâu angin sukbohmang a ti che: khâu angin insukpung la, khâuhawn angin insukpung rawh."
"Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.","I sumdâwngtuhai chu vâna ara- sihai nêka tamin i sukpung a, khâu chun a suksiet a, a vuong hmang el hlak."
"Thy princes are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.","I mi lallukhum khumhai chu khâuhawn ang an na, i sipai hotuhai chu khaw dei nia khâu ruol pala fu khâwm ang an nih, amiruokchu, nisa a hung suok a, an vuong hmang a, an umna hmun hrim hriet a ni nawh."
"Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.","Aw Assuria lal, i berâm vêngtu- hai chu an inlusu ie, i mi lienhai chu an châwl a, i mipuihai chu tlânghaia chun an indar zo a, ṭhuoi khâwmtu tukhawm an um nawh."
There is no assuaging of thy hurt; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the report of thee clap their hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?,"I na chu a damna ding a um nawh, i hliemna chu a nasa hle a nih; i ri hre taphawt chun kut an ben- khum che; i rîtlona hin a chîm rawp naw tu am a um a?"
