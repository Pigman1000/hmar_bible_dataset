"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Israelhai chu an hung do a, chuongchun, Israel mihai chu Philis- tin mihai hmaa inthawk chun an tlânsieh a, Gilboa tlânga dâm chun anni chu thatin an tlu tâwl a."
"And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Saula le a naupasalhai chu nasatakin an hnawt a; chuongchun, Philistin mi- hai chun Saula naupasal Jonathan le Abinadab le Malkisua chu anthat a."
"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.","Chun, Saula chunga chun indona chu a hung zuol ta hle el a, thal kâp mihai chun ama chu an nangchîng tah a; thal kâp mihai lei chun nasatakin a beidawng tah a."
"Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.","Chun, Saula chun a râlthuom chawitu kuoma chun, “I kâwlhnâm kha phawi la, mi hung sunthleng el rawh; chuong naw chun, hieng sertan lohai hi hung an ta, mi hung sukbuoi rawi an tih,” a ta.

"And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died.","Chun, a râlthuom chawitu chun Saula chu a thi tah ti a hmu chun, ama khawm chu a kâwlhnâm chu a baw lût a, a thi ve tah a."
"So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.","Chuongchun, Saula chu a thi tah a, a naupasal pathumhai leh; an sûngkuo chu an rêngin hmunkhata chun an thi tah a."
"And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.","Chun, ruoma um Israel mihai po po chu an tlânseh a, Saula le a naupa- salhai chu an thi ti an hriet phing chun an khuohai chu an tlânsan a, an tlânse ve tah a; chuongchun, Philistin mihai chu an hung a, chuongahai chun an hung chêng tah a."
"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.","Chun, a zînga Philistin mihaiin an râl thathai thuom chu hlîp dinga an hung chun Saula le a naupasalhai chu Gilboa tlânga chun an lo tlu ve zing ti an hmu tah a."
"And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people.","Ama chu a thuom an hlîp a, a lu chu an lâk a, a râlthuom leh, mipuihai le an milimhai kuoma chanchin intlun dingin Philistin rama chun an thawn vêl tah a."
"And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.","Chuongchun, a râlthuomhai chu an pathienhai ina chun an sieh a, a lu chu Dagon ina chun an târ a."
"And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,","Chun, Jabes-gilead mihai po po chun Saula chunga Philistin mihai thilthaw po po chu an hrietin,"
"all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.","mi hrât huoisenhai po po chu an tho a, Saula ruong le a naupasalhai ruonghai chu an lâk hmang a, Jabes-a chun an hung lâk a, Jabes- a thingsaisuo hnuoiah an ruhai chu an phûm a, ni sari sûng bu an nghei a."
"So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire thereby,","Chuongchun, Saula chu LALPA chunga a ringum nawna leiin a thi tah a; LALPA thu chu a zâwm nawh a, khawhri zâwl aisânthiem chu zawng suokin a râwn a,"
"and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.","LALPA chu a râwn naw a nih. Chuongchun, LALPA chun ama chu a sukhlum a, a ram chu Jesai naupa David kuoma pêk a ni tah."
"Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.","Chun, Israelhai po po chu David kuomah Hebrona chun an hung inkhâwm a, “Ngai ta, i ru le i tisahai kan ni hi."
"In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel.","Kha hmaa Saula lal a ni lai khawm khan, nangin i mi keihruoi a, Israel rama hin i mi hung lûtpui a na, LALPA i Pathien chun i kuomah, ‘Ka mi Israelhai chu châwm i ta, ka mi Israelhai chunga chun lal nîng i tih,’ a ti kha,” an ta."
"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.","Chuongchun, Israel upahai po po chu Hebronah lal kuoma chun an hung a, David chun LALPA hmaah Hebrona chun anni le chun thuthlung a siem tah a; Samuel kuta LALPA thu ang peiin David chu Israel lal ni dingin hriek an nâl tah a."
"And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.","Chun, David le Israel mihai po po chu Jerusalemah an hang feh a (chu chu Jebus a nih); chun, Jebus mihai, a rama chênghai chu chutaka chun an um a."
"And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.","Jebusa chênghai chun David kuomah, “Hitaka hin i hung lût ding a ni nawh,” an lo tih a. Nisienla- khawm, David chun Zion kul chu a lâk a; chu chu David khawpui a hung ni tah a."
"And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.","David chun, “Tukhawm Jebus mi that hmasataktu chu sipai hotu tak nîng a tih,” a ta. Chun, Zeruia naupa Joab chu a hmasatak a na, chuong- chun, hotua siem a ni tah a."
And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.,"Chun, David chu kula chun a chêng tah a; chuleichun, David khaw- pui an ti tah a."
"And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.","Chun, khawpui chu Millo le a vêl po po chu a vêlin a bâwl a; chun, Joab chun a la bâkhai chu a siemṭha bawk a."
And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.,"Chun, David chu a hung ropui deu deu a, sipaihai LALPA chu a kuomah a um sih a."
"Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.","Chun, hienghai hi sipai huoisen bîkhai Davidin a nei, Israel chung- thua LALPA thu ang peia ama lala siem dinga Israel mihai po po inkawpa, a ram sûnga ama le hrâta insuklanghai chu an nih."
"And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.","Hieng hi mi thilthawthei David- in a nei chu an nih: Hakmon thlaa mi Jasobeam, sâwmthum chunga hotu; mi za thum chungah a fei ân let a, kâr loin anni chu a that tâwl tah a."
"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.","Chun, ama hnunga chun Aho mi, Dodo naupa Eleazar, mi thilthaw- thei pathumhai laia pakhat chu a nih."
"He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.","Pasdammima khan David kuomah a um a, chu hmuna chun Philistin mihai chu indo dingin an inkhâwm a, chutaka chun, hmun, buṭeia sip a um a; mipuihai chu Philistin mihai hmaa chun an tlân- seh a."
"And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory.","Chun, chu bu hmun lailung laia chun an ngîr a, an hum tlat tah a; Philistin mihai chu an that a, LALPA chun hnena ropuitakin anni chu a sanhim a."
"And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.","Chun, sipai sâwmthumhai chu lungpuiah, David kuomah, Adullam pûka chun an va feh a; chun, Philistin sipaihai chu Rephaim ruoma chun ruongchaichea thlâkin an um a."
"And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.","Chun, David chu kula chun a um a; Philistin sipai ruol chu chu lai chun Bethlehema chun an um a."
"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!","Chun, David chun a châk a, “Kul kawtkhâr bula Bethlehem tui- sunsuo tui kha dâwn dingin mi pe um hai sien chu aw!” a ta."
"And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,","Chuongchun, mi pathumhai chun Philistin sipaihai chu an nêr- thleng a, kul kawtkhâr bula Beth- lehema tuisunsuoa inthawk chun tui chu an va chawi a, an hung lâk a, David kuomah an hung lâk tah a: nisienlakhawm, David chun tui chu a dawn nawh a, LALPA kuomah a bunthlâk ta lem a."
"and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.","“Hi hi ka thaw ding hi ka Pathien chun mi khap raw se: an hringna ṭiumtaka sietuhai, hieng mihai hringna thisen hi ka dâwn ding am a nih? An hringna chân huoma hi hi an hung lâk a ni sih a,” a ta. Chuleichun, a dâwn ta nawh a. Hieng thil hi mi thilthawthei pathumhai chun an thaw a nih."
"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.","Chun, Joab unaupa Abisai chu sâwmthumhai laia hotu tak a na, ama chun za thumhai chunga chun a fei chu a phawi a, anni chu a that a, pathumhai laia chun hming ṭhat a hlawh a."
"Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.","Sâwmthumhai lai chun ama chu inza a kai a; chuongchun, anni chunga hotua siem chu a ni tah a; nisienlakhawm, a hmaa pathumhai lai chu a ṭhang nawh."
"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.","Kabzeel mi, mi thilthawtheitak naupa, Jehoiada naupa Benaia, thil nasatakhai thawtu chu a nih: Moaba Ariel naupasal pahnihai chu a that a, a fe thla a, vûr tlâk hun laiin pûk sûnga chun sakeibaknei a that bawk a."
"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.","Chun, Aigupta mi, mi taksa lientak tawng ngaa insâng a that a; chu Aigupta mi kuta chun puon khâwngtu puonkawl ang hi fei a um a; ama chun hmawl leh a pan thlâk a, Aigupta mi kuta fei chu a lâkpêk a, ama fei ngei chun a that tah a."

"Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.","Ngai ta, ama chu mi sâwm- thumhai nêk khan nasatakin inza a kai a, amiruokchu, a hmasatak pa- thumhai lai chu a ṭhang nawh: David chun ama vêngtu pâwl hotua chun a siem a."

"So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.","Chuongchun, David chun Ai- gupta vadung Sihora inthawkin Hamath lûtna chena mi chu Kiriath- jearima inthawka Pathien bâwm chu hang la dingin Israel mi po pohai chu a khâwm tah a."

"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.","Chuongchun, LALPA lungin- sen chu Uzza chunga chun a hung chawk a, bâwm chu a kuta a hei ban lei chun ama chu a sukhlum tah a; chutaka chun Pathien hmaah a thi tah a."

"So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.","Chuongchun, David chun bâwm chu David khuoah ama kuoma chun a sawn ta nawh a, amiruokchu, Git mi Obed-edom ina chun a lâk lût lem tah a."
"And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu Obed- edom sûngkuo lai, a ina chun thla thum lai a um tah a; chuongchun, Pathienin Obed-edom in sûng le a nei po po chu mal a sâwmpêk a."

"And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun David chu Israel po po chunga lal dingin hriek nâl a ni tah ti an hriet chun, Philistin mihai po po chu David zawng ding chun an hang feh a; chun, David khawm chun a lo hrietin, anni chu tuok dingin a suok tah a."
Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.,"Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chu an hung a, Rephaim ruoma chun an hung inzâr a."
"And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand?

"So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.","Chuongchun, Baal-perazim chenin an hang feh a; David chun chutaka chun anni chu a hne tâwl a; chun, David chun, “Pathien chun ka hmêlmahai chu ka kutah, tui ting inṭhe ang elin a sukdar tah a ni hi,” a tih a.

"And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.","Chun, anni chun an pathienhai chu chutaka chun an tlânsan a, David chun thu a pêk a, chuonghai chu meiin an raw tah a."
And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.,Philistin mihai chu phaizâwl tieng chun an la hung inzar nâwk ta rawp a.
"And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.","David chun Pathien a rawn nâwk a, Pathien chun a kuomah, “Anni chu hang hnawt naw la, annia inthawkin inherhmang lem la, thingtheihmi kûng zâwna khan anni chu zu hnawt lem rawh."
"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.","Chun, thingtheihmi lêrhaia chun kalpên rihai i hriet pha chun indo dingin fe suok la; Pathien chu i hmaah Philistin sipaihai chu suk- hlum dingin a fe suok tah a ni sih a,” a ta."

And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.,"David chanchin chu ram po poah ân thang tah a; chuongchun, LALPAIN ama ṭina chu hnam po pohai chungah ân umtir tah a."

"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.","Chun, David chun pumraw- hmang thilinhlân le inremna thilin- hlân chu ân hlân hnung chun, LALPA hmingin mipuihai chu mal a sâwm tah a."
"And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.","Chun, Israel mihai mi tin el chu a nuhmei a pasalin, bei tlang le sa tlin le grêp ra ṭâwl a pêk seng a."
"And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:","Chun, Levi mihai mi ṭhenkhat chu LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu inpâka lâwmthu hrila, ama chawi- mawi dingin LALPA bâwm hmaa rawngbâwl hlak ding chun a ruot a;"
"Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;","a hotu tak chu Asaph a na, ama dawta chun Zekaria, Jaaziel, Semira- moth, Jehiel, Mattithia, Eliab, Benaia, Obed-edom le Jeiel hai; ṭingṭang le perkhuong puhai an nih;"

"Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.","Chun, chu ni chun David chun Asaph le a unauhai LALPA hmaa lâwmthu chu inhlân dingin a ruot hmasatak a."
"O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.","Aw, LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril unla, a hming lam ro; Mi tin lai chun a thil thaw inhriettir ro."
"Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.","Ama chawimmawiin hla sak unla,ama inpâkin sak ro; A thilmak thaw po po thu hril ro."
Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.,A hming inthieng chu sawng ro; LALPA zawngtuhai lungril chu hlim raw se.
Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.,"LALPA le a hrâtna chu zawng unla, A hmêl chu zawng rawp ro."
"Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,","A thilmak thawhai chu hre zing ro, A thilmakhai le a baua a rorêl suokhai chu:"
"O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.","Aw, a siehlaw Israel thlahai, Jakob thla, a ithlanghai."
He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.,"Ama chu LALPA ei Pathien chu a nih, A rorêlhai chu hnuoi chung po poa hin a um."
"Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,","A thuthlung chu kumkhuoin hre zing unla, Suon sâng khat chena a thu lo pêk chu."
"The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,","Abraham kuoma a thuthlung le, Isak kuoma a inkhâmna chu."
"And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,","Chu ma chu thuruot ni dingin Jakob kuomah a sukdet a, Israel kuoma kumkhawtluong thuthlung dingin;"
"Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;","“Kanaan ram hi i kuomah pêng ka ti che, I rochanpuol ding chu,” tiin."
"When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;","Mi tlâwmte chau in ni lai khan, Anih, mi tlâwmte chau, chutaka mikhuol in na;"
"And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.","Hnam tum tum kuomah an fe lawn an fe lawn a, Ram tum tuma inthawkin mi tum tumhai kuomah."
"He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,","Tu inêksâwr khawm a phal nawh a. Anih, anni leiin lalhai khawm a kâwk a;"
"Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.","“Ka hriek nâlhai chu tâwk naw unla, Ka zâwlneihai pawi hrim hrim khawm tâwk naw ro,” tiin."
"Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day.","Leihnuoia um po pohai, LALPA chawimawiin hla sak ro, Ni tin a sandamna thu chu inhriettir ro."
"Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.","Hnam tin lai chun a ropuizie hril unla, Mi tinrênghai lai chun a thilmak thawhai hril ro."
"For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.","LALPA chu a ropui a, nasataka inpâk ding a ni sih a, Ama chu pathien po po nêka ṭi ding a nih."
For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.,"Mipuihai pathienhai chu milimhai an ni sih a, LALPA ruok chun vânhai khi a siem a nih."
Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.,"Chawimawina le ropuina a hmaah an um a, Hrâtna le hlimna chu a hmun inthiengah an um."
"Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;","Mi tina chi tinrênghai, LALPA kuomah pe unla, LALPA kuoma chun ropuina le hrâtna pe ro."
"Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him; Worship Jehovah in holy array.","LALPA kuomah a hming ropui chu pe unla, Thil inhlân ding chawiin, a hmaah hung ro. Aw, inthieng mawina inbelin LALPA chu chibai bûk ro."

"Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.","Vânhai khi lâwmtakin um sienla, hnuoi khawm hi hlimtakin um raw se; Hnam tin lai chun, “LALPA chu lalah a ṭhung a,” ti ro."
"Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;","Tuisuoriet le a sûnga um po po hi inri hum hum sienla, Lo le a sûnga um po po hi lâwmtakin um raw se."
Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth.,"Chu pha chun ram hnuoia thing po po hi LALPA hmaah hlimin hla sak an tih, Hnuoi ro rêl dingin a hung ding a ni sih a."
O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.,"Aw LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ro, ama chu a ṭha sih a, A zângaina chu kumkhuoin a um zing sih a."
"And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.","A kuoma chun, “Aw Pathien, nang kan sandamna, mi sandam la, Nangin mi ṭhuoi khâwmin,hnamhai laia inthawk chun mi sanhim la, I hming inthieng kuoma lâwmthu hril ding le, Nangma inpâknaa chawimawi ding in,” ti ro."
"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.","LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se. Chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin. Chun, mipui po po chun, “Amen,” an lo tih a, LALPA an inpâk tah a."
"So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;","Chun, ni tina sin ṭûlzie ang peia rawngbâwl zing zing dingin, Asaph le a unauhai chu LALPA thuthlungna bâwm hmaa chun a sie tah a;"
"and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;",Obed-edom le an unauhai sâwmruk le pariet hai leh; Jeduthun naupa Obed-edom le Hosa chu kawtkhâr vêngtuhai ni dingin;

"to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;","Israelhai kuoma thu a pêk tah, LALPA dâna in ziek ang po po ang taka zîngtieng le zântieng tina, pumrawhmanga mâichâma pumraw- hmang thilinhlân chu LALPA hmaa inhlân dingin;"
"and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever;","chun, an kuoma chun Heman hai, Jeduthun hai, an hming lama thlanga umhai chu, a zângaina chu kumkhuoin a um zing leia LALPA chu lâwmthu hril dingin an um a;"
"and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.","anni laia Heman le Jeduthun chu, ân ring zing ding dârbenthek le tawtawrâwt le chun an um a; Pathien hlahai sakna dinga hlasakna thuom- hnaw kim le chun, chun, Jeduthun naupasalhai chu dai kawtkhâra um ding an nih."
And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.,"Chun, mi po po chu mâni in seng- ah an ṭîn tah a; David khawm chu a in- sûng chu mal sâwm dingin a ṭîn tah a."
"And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah dwelleth under curtains.","Chun, David chun a in chu a hung hluo phing chun, zâwlnei Nathan kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, kei chu Sidar thingphêk inah ka um a.

"And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.","Chun, Nathan chun David kuomah, “I lungrila um ang po po chu thaw el rawh, Pathien chu i kuomah a um annâwm,” a ta."
"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,","Chun, chu zân le le chun Pathien thu chu Nathan kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a,"
"Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:","“Hang fe la, ka siehlaw David chu hang hril rawh, ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih, chêngna dingin ka ta dingin in mi bâwlpêk naw ti nih;"
"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.","Israel thlahai Aiguptaa in- thawka ka hung ṭhuoi suoka inthawk vawisûn ni chen hin inah ka la um ngai nawh a; puon in pakhata inthawka a dangah, biekbûk pakhata inthawka a dangah ka um lem kha."
"In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?","Khâwlai hmuna khawm Israel- hai ka fepuina taphawta chun, ka mihai châwm dinga thu ka ipêk, Israel rorêltuhai a tu tu kuoma khawm khan, Iengdinga Sidar in in mi bâwlpêk naw am a na? ka ti hlak am a nih?’"
"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:","Chuleiin, ka siehlaw David kuoma chun tuhin hang hril la, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ka mi Israelhai chunga lal ni dingin, berâm tlatna hmuna berâm hnung zuinaa inthawk ka lâk suok cheh a;"
"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.","i fena taphawtahai chun ka hung ve pei a, i hmêlmahai po po chu i hmaa inthawkin ka sat thlâkpêk cheh a; chuongchun, leihnuoia um, mi ropuitak hming angin i hming chu siem ka tih."
"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,","Ka mi Israelhai ta ding chun hmun ruot ka ta, anni chu phun ka tih, anni hmun ngeia chun an um a, an insawn nâwk ta nawna dingin. Chun, inhma ang khan rîtlona thla- hai chun anni chu sukse ta naw nih,"
and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.,"ka mi Israelhai chunga um dinga rorêltuhai ka ruot nia ang khan; chun, i hmêlmahai po po chu tukdawl bawk ka tih. Chunawa khawm, LALPA chun sûngkuo siem- pêk a che ti hi ka hril che a nih."
"And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.","Chun, i thlatuhai kuoma i fena ding nihai a hung bikim pha chun, nangma hnunga hin i thla ngei hung inngîr ka ta, chu chu i naupasalhai laia mi ngei nîng a tih, chun, a ram chu sukdet bawk ka tih."
"He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.",Ama chun in mi bâwlpêk a ta; kei khawma a ram chu kumkhuoin tungdingpêk bawk ka tih.
"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;","A pa nîng ka ta, ama chu ka naupa nîng a tih; i hmaa umpa kuoma inthawka ka lâk hmang ang khan amaa inthawk chun ka zângaina chu la hmang naw ningah;"
but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.,"amiruokchu, ka ina le ka ramah kumkhuoin inngîr dettir lem ka tih; chuongchun, a lalṭhungpha chu chatuonin tungding nîng a tih,’” tiin."
"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.","Hieng thu po pohai ang tak le, hieng thilhmu po po ang tak hin Nathan chun David chu a hril tah a."
"Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?","Chun, lal David chu a lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a ṭhung tah a; chun, ama chun, “Aw LALPA Pathien, tu am ka na, ka insûng khawm ieng am a ni hrim a, hieng chen lâwm lâwm i mi ṭhuoi hi?"
"And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.","Hi hi i mithmua chun thil chîtê a na, aw Pathien, nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw sûngkuo chunga thil la hung tlung ding thu chu i hril a, Aw LALPA Pathien, mi lien ang elin i ngai hi;"
What can David say yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.,"i siehlaw chawimawia a um chungthua hin, hi bâk hi David hin ieng am i kuoma la hril sa rawp a ta? I siehlaw chu i hriet chieng sih a."
"O Jehovah, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.","Aw LALPA, i siehlaw lei le, nangma lungril puoksuok ang peiin, hieng thil ropuitakhai hi inhriettir dingin, hieng thil ropui po po hi i thaw ta hi."
"O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.","Aw LALPA, nanga ang tu- khawm an um nawh a, nang Pathien naw chu a dang an um nawh, kan nahaia kan hriet ta ang peiin."
"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemedst out of Egypt?","Aigupta rama inthawka i mihai an hmaa hnamhai chu hnawt suok peia în tlan suok, thil râpthlâk le thil ropuia i hming siempêk dinga, nang- ma ta ding ngeia nang Pathien feha în tlan suok hnam, i mi Israelhai ang hnuoi chunga hin ieng hnam am an um hrim a?"
"For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.",I mi Israelhai chu nangin i mi- hai ngei ni kumkhuo dingin i siem a; nang LALPA chu an Pathien i ni sih a.
"And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.","Tuhin, Aw LALPA, i siehlaw chungthua le a insûng chungthua i hrilhai, kumkhuoa dingin hung suk- det la, i hril angtak ngei chun nangin hung thaw bawk rawh."
"And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.","‘Sipaihai LALPA chu Israelhai Pathien a na, Israelhai Pathien ngei chu: i siehlaw David sûngkuo khawm chu nangma hmaa sukdet a nih,’ tiin, i hming chu tungdinga kumkhuoa chawimawi ni raw se."
"For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee.","Aw ka Pathien, nangin i siehlaw kuoma hin sûngkuo i siempêk ding a nih ti i suklang ta sih a; chuleiin,i siehlaw hin i hmaa a lungrila ṭawng- ṭai dingin a lo ngam tah a nih."
"And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:","Chun, tuhin, Aw LALPA, nang chu Pathien i na, hieng thil ṭhahai hi i siehlaw kuoma hin i lo tiem tah a;"
"and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.","chuongchun, tuhin i hmaa kum- khuoa a um zing theina dingin i sie- hlaw sûngkuo chu malsâwmpêk hi i lawmzâwngtak a na; Aw LALPA, nang chun mal i sâwm tah a, kumkhuoa dinga malsâwm a ni ta sih a,” tiin."
"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.","Hi hnunga hin hieng hi a hung ni a, David chun Philistin mi- hai chu a hne a, anni chu a tukdawl a, Philistin mihai kuta inthawk chun Gath le a vêl khuohai chu a lâk tah a."
"And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.","Chun, Moab khawm chu a hung hneh a, Moab mihai chu David sie- hlawhai an hung ni tah a, chuong- chun, siehai an hung chawi a."
"And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.","Euphrates vadung chena a ram chu indin dinga a fe malamin, Zoba lal Hadarezer chu Mahath chenin David chun a hne bawk a."
"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.","David chun amaa inthawk chun sakawr tawlailîr sâng khat le, sakawr chung chuong mi sâng sari le, kea fe mi sîng hni leh a manpêk a, chun, David chun tawlailîr keimi sa- kawrhai chu, tawlailîr za khata ding chau a hlah a, an ke tha a sat vawng a."
"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.","Chun, Damaskaa Suria mihai chu Zoba lal Hadarezer ṭhangpui dinga an hung chun David chun Suria mi sîng hni le sâng hni chu a that a."
"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.","Chun, David chun Damaskaa Suriaa chun sipai pâwl a sieh a, chuongchun, Suria mihai chu David siehlawhai an hung ni tah a, chuongchun, sie dâm an hung chawi a. Chun, LALPA chun a fena tieng tieng David chu hnena a pêk pei a."
"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.","Chun, David chun Hadarezer sie- hlawhai iphur rângkachak phawhai chu a lâk a, Jerusalemah a hung lâk a."
"And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.","Chun, Hadarezer khawpui Tibhath le Kun-a inthawkin David chun dârsen tamtak el a lâk bawk a; chuonghai chu Solomon khan dârsen bûr le bêlhai le, inṭhutnahai le, dârsen châwtawl kha a siem a nih."
"And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,","Chun, Hamath lal Tou chun Davidin Zoba lal Hadarezer a hne ti a hriet chun,"
"he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.","Hadarezer chu a do a, a hne ta lei chun, ama chu malsâwma chibai bûk dingin, a naupa Hadoram chu lal David kuoma chun a tir tah a; Hadarezer chu Tou le chun an lo indo rawp hlak tah a; chun, ama chun dârsen le tangkaruo le rângkachak bûr le bêl chi tinrêng elhai chu ama chu a thawn a."
"These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.","Hieng po pohai, tangkaruo le rângkachak hnam tamtakhaia in- thawka a lâkhai chu David chun LALPA kuomah ân hlân a; Edoma inthawk dâm, Moaba inthawk dâm, Ammon thlahaia inthawk dâm, Phi- listin mihaia inthawk dâm, Amalek mihaia inthawk dâmin a lâk a nih."
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.,Chu naw khawm chu Zeruia naupa Abisai chun Edom mi sîng le sâng riet chu Chi Ruoma chun a hneh a.
And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.,"Chun, Edoma chun sipai pâwl a sieh a, chuongchun, Edom mihai po po chu David khuo le tui an hung ni tah a. Chun, LALPA chun a fena taphawtah David chu hnena a pêk pei a."
And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.,"Chun, David chun Israelhai po po chunga chun ro a rêl a; a mi po pohai chungah indiktak le feltakin ro a rêl a."
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;,Zeruia naupa Joab chu sipai hotu a na; Ahilud naupa Jehosaphat chu thil inchiktu a na.
"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;","Ahitub naupa Zadok le, Abia- thar naupa Abimelek chu thiempu an na; Savsa chu lekhaziektu a nih;"
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.,"Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu Kereth le Peleth mihai chunga hotu a nih; chun, David naupasalhai chu lal tienga hotu an nih."
"And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.","Hi hnunga hin hieng hi a hung na; Ammon thlahai lal Nahas chu a thih a, ama aia chun a naupa chun ro a rêl tah a."
"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.","Chun, David chun, “A pa khan ka chungah lunginsietna ân entir leiin, Nahas naupa Hanun chunga hin lunginsietna inentir vêng ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, a pa chungthua chun, ama thlamuon dingin David chun mi a tir a. David siehlawhai chu ama thlamuon dingin Hanun kuoma chun Ammon thlahai rama chun an hung tah a."
"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?","Amiruokchu, Ammon thlahai laia an hotuhai chun Hanun kuoma chun, “David chun i pa chu ân za leiin i kuomah thlamuontuhai a hung tir ni dingin i ring am a nih? Hieng a siehlawhai hi thil zawng suok ding le, hre ding le ram chu enthlit dinga i kuoma hung an ni lem a ni naw maw?” an ta."
"So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.","Chuongchun, Hanun chun David siehlawhai chu a man a, an hmul a vâwpêk a, an silfênhai chu a laiah, a mawng tlung rakin a thlêrpêk a, anni chu a tir hmang tah a."
"Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.","Chun, mi tu amanih David kuoma chun a va feh a, mihai an lo sawisak dân chu a va hril tah a. Ama chun anni chu tuok dingin mi a tir a; mihai chu nasatakin an inzak sih a. Chun, lal chun, “In khâkhmulhai ân ṭhang sei hmakhat chu Jerikoah um phawt el ro, chun, hung chau ro,” a tih a."
"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chu David ta dingin theidaumin an insiem tah ti an hriet phing chun Hanun le Ammon thlahai chun, Zobaa inthawk dâm, Aram-maakaa inthawk dâm, Meso- potamiaa inthawk dâma sakawr puhai le sakawr tawlailîrhai hawna dingin tangkaruo talent sâng khat an thawn tah a."
"So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.","Chuongchun, sakawr tawlailîr sîng thum le sâng hni chu, Maaka lal le a mihai le chun an ruoi tah a; anni chu an hung a, Medeba phâk hmaa chun an inkul tah a.

"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.","Davidin chu chu a hriet chun, Joab le mi thilthawthei sipai pâwl po po chu a tir tah a."
"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chu an hung suok a, khawpui dai kawtkhâra chun an intlar a; chun, lalhai a hung ṭhangvehai khawm chu an khâtin phûla chun an um a."
"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.","Joab chun indona chu hnung- tieng le hmatienga chun an hung nawr a nih ti a hmu chun, Israel laia mi ditumhai chu a thlangsuok a, Suria mihai hmaa chun ân tlartir tah a."
And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.,"Mi dang po po chu a unaupa Abisai kuta chun ân kawltir a, Ammon thlahai epa chun an intlar ve tah a."
"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.","Ama chun, “Suria mihai chu ka ta dinga an hung hrât talaw chun, mi ṭhangpui i ta; chun, Ammon thlahai chu nanga ta dinga an hung hrât talaw bawk chun, keiin ṭhangpui thung ka ti cheh a."
"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.","Insukhuoi unla, ei hnam le ei Pathien khawpuihai sanin insuk- pasal ei tiu: chun, Pathien chun ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw raw se,” a ta."

"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chun Suria mihai chu an tlânsie ti an hriet phing chun, anni khawm chuong ang bawk chun a unaupa Abisai hmaa inthawk chun an tlânse ve tah a, khawpuia chun an lût tah a, Joab ruok chu Jerusalema chun a kîr nâwk tah a."
"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.","Chun, Suria mihaiin Israelhai hmaa chun se nâwk zuol an ni tah ti an hriet chun mi an tir a, Vadungpui râla Suria mi umhai chu, Hadarezer sipaihai hotu Sophak rawiin an incha suok tah a."
"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.","Chu chu David kuoma chun an hril a; chun, ama chun Israel mihai po po chu a kei khâwm a, Jordan râl an hung kai a, anni chu an hmuh a, thaw dingin an inzar tah a."
"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.","Chun, Israelhai hmaa chun Suria mihai chu an tlânseh a; chuong- chun, David chun sakawr tawlailîr sîng sari puhai le, kea fe mi sîng li Suria mi chu a that tah a; chun, Sophak sipaihotu khawm chu a that tah a."
"And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.","Chun, Hadarezer siehlawhaiin Israelhai hmaa chun an chan a se nâwk zuol an tah ti an hriet chun David le chun inremna an siem a, ama rawng chu an bâwl tah a; Suria mihai khawm chun Ammon thlahai chu an ṭhangpui ngai ta hrim hrim nawh a."

"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.

"And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.","Setan chu Israel mihai chunga chun a hung tho a, David chu Israel mihai chu ân tiemtir tah a."

"And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?","Joab chun, “LALPA chun a mihai chu an ni hlak zât let za khawma sukpung sienla, ka pu lal, ka pu siehlawhai an ni vawng tho a ni naw am a nih?

"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.","Nisienlakhawm, lal thu chun Joab chu a hne tah a. Chuongchun, Joab chu a fe suok a, Israel ram po po chu a fang suok a, Jerusalemah a hung nâwk a."
And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.,"Chun, Joab chun mipuihai tiem- na nizât chu David kuomah a pêk tah a.

But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.,"Nisienlakhawm, Benjamin chi le Levi mihai chu anni lai chun a tiem sa ve nawh a; Joab ngaia chun lal thu chu theida a um vieu si leiin."
And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.,"Chun, hi thila hin Pathien chu a lâwm ta naw hle el a; chuleiin, Israel ram chu a hung hrem tah a."
"And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.","Chun, David chun Pathien kuom- ah, “Hi thil ka lo thaw taa hin, nasa- takin thil ka suksuol a nih; amiruok- chu, tuhin ka ngên che, i siehlaw khawhlona hi ngaidam rawh; invêt thlâktakin ka lo thaw ta sih a,” a ta."
"And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,","Chun, LALPA chun David zâwl- nei Gad kuoma chun, “Fe la, David kuoma chun hieng hin va hril rawh."
"Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Thil pathum ka ruotpêk cheh a, hi laia pakhat hi thlang rawh, i ta dinga ka thawpêk theina ding chein,’ tiin,” a ta."
"So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:","Chuongchun, Gad chu David kuoma chun a feh a, a kuoma chun, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; i dittak thlang rawh;"
"either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.","kum thum sûng ṭâm amanih; i hmêlmahai kâwlhnâmin a hnawt phâk pha cheh a, ihmêlmahai hmaa thla thum sûng sukbohmanga um amanih; annawleh, Israel ram sûng po poa LALPA vântirkoin hung sukse a, ram sûnga hri hung inlêng a, LALPA kâwlhnâm chu ni thum sûng tuor chu.

"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.","Chun, David chun Gad kuoma chun, “Nasatakin ka lunginzîng a,LALPA kutah a tlûkin tlulût phawt el ka tih; a zângaina chu a nasa sih a, chuleiin, mihriem kuta chun mîn tlûktir êm naw nih,” a ta."
So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.,"Chuongchun, LALPA chun Israel chunga chun hri a tir tah a, Israel mihai chu sîng sari an thi a."
"And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Chun, Pathien chun sukse dingin Jerusalema chun vântirko a tir a; chuonga a suksiet ding lai tak chun LALPA chun a hmuh a, thil ṭha naw thaw a tum chu ân kîr a; chuongchun, a suksetu ding vântirko kuoma chun, “A hun tah, i kut tuhin chel hri rawh,” a ta. Chun, vântirko chu Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla chun a ngîr ta zing a."
"And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.","Chun, David chu a hung dâk suok a, LALPA vântirko hnuoi le vân kâra ngîr chu a hang hmu tah a; a kâwlhnâm phawi sain, Jerusalem tienga bân pharin a hmuh a.

"And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.","Chun, David chun Pathien kuoma chun, “Mipuihai chu tiem dinga thu pe kha kei ka ni naw am a nih?

"Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun, Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla chun LALPA ta dinga mâichâm hang bâwl dingin David chu fe dingin, David kuoma hril dingin Gad chu thu a pêk tah a."
"And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.","Chun, Gad hril ang chun, LALPA hminga a hril ang ngei chun David chu a hang fe tah a."
"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.","Chun, Ornan chu a hei ngha kîr chun vântirko chu a hmuh a, a naupasalhai pali ama le umhai ruok chu an inbi a. Ornan chun bu a chîl lai a na."
"And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.","Chun, David chun Ornan a hung pan chun Ornan chun a hei en a, David chu a hmu a, hrizâwla inthawk chu a hung suok a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin David hmaa chun a kûn tah a."
"Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.","Chun, David chun Ornan kuom- a chun, “LALPA ta dinga mâichâm ka siem theina dingin hi hrizâwl hmun hi mi pe rawh; a man huntâwk zet angin mi pêng i ta; mipuihaia inthawka hri ân kieng theina dingin,” a ta."
"And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.","Chun, Ornan chun David kuom- ah, “Nangmân la el rawh, ka pu lal hin a ngai a ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw el raw se; en ta, hi bâwngchal pumraw- hmang thilinhlâna dingin ka pêk cheh a, bu vuokna thuomhnawhai hi a thing dingin, chun, bu hi bu thilinhlân dingin; a rêngin ka pêk vawng che a nih,” a ta."
"And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.","Chun, lal David chun Ornan kuoma chun, “Ni lo e a, a man kim chie ang takin kân châwk ding annâwm; nangma ta chu LALPA ta dingin ka lâkpêk ding che a ni nawh a, chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân khawm chu man bo chun kân hlân ding a ni nawh,” a ta."
So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.,"Chuongchun, David chun Ornan kuoma chun rângkachak a bûk a, shekel za ruk a hmun man ding chun a pêk tah a."
"And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.","Chun, Davidin chutaka chun mâichâm chu LALPA ta dingin a siem a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân le, in- remna thilinhlân chu ân hlân a, LALPA chu a ko tah a; chun, ama chun vâna inthawk chun pumraw- hmangna mâichâm chungah meiin a zuk dawn tah a."
And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.,"Chun, LALPA chun vântirko chu thu a pêk a; a kâwlhnâm chu a bâwma chun a khum nâwk tah a."
"At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.","Chu huna chun, Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla chun LALPA chun a zuk dawn ti a hmu phing chun chutaka chun ân thâwi tah a."
"For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.","LALPA biekbûk thlalêra Mosien a siem le, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânna mâichâm chu, chu huna chun Gibeona bâwlhmuna chun a la um zing sih a."
But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.,"Nisienlakhawm, chu hmaa chun Pathien rawn dingin David chu a fe thei nawh a,LALPA vântirko kâwlhnâm lei chun a ṭi tlat sih a."
"Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.","David chun, “Hi hi LALPA Pathien in a na, hi hi Israel ta dinga pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm chu a nih,” a ta."
And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.,David chun Israel rama mikhuol umhai chu kei khâwm dingin thu a pêk a; Pathien in bâwlna dinga lung sut dingin lung suttuhai a ruot a.
"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;","David chun ân huonna kawt- khâra ding le a zawmna vêlhaia dingin thîr tamtak a kilna dingin a buotsai a; dârsen chi tamtak el a bûk hriet lo,"
and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.,Sidar thing a nizât hriet lo; Zidon mihai le Tura mihai khan David kuomah Sidar thing an hung lâk ṭeu sih a.
"And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.","Chun, David chun, “Ka naupa Solomon hi a naupangin iengkhawm a hriet si nawh a, LALPA ta dinga in bâwl ding hi ropuitak a ni ding a na, ram po poa ropuitak le hming inthang tak el ding a ni sih a; chuleiin, keiin buotsai ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chun a thi hma ngei chun nasatakin a buotsai tah a."
"Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chun, a naupa Solomon chu a ko a; Israelhai Pathien, LALPA ta dinga in bâwl dingin thu a pêk tah a."
"And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.","David chun Solomon kuomah, “Ka naupa, keia ta ding chun ka Pathien LALPA hming ta dinga in bâwl chu ka lungrilah a um a."
"But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, ‘Nang chun thisen tamtak în suo tah a, indona ropuitakhaia khawm i ṭhang tah a; ka mithmua hnuoi chunga thisen tamtak în suo ta leiin ka hming ta dingin in bâwl naw ti ni,"
"Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.","Ngai ta, naupasal hung nei i ta, ama chu mi sâwldamtak nîng a tih, a vêlin, a hmêlmahaia inthawk khawm- in ama chu râlmuongna pêng ka ta, a hming khawm Solomon nîng a ta, ama hun laia chun Israel rama hin muongna le râlmuongna pêng ka tih;"

"Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee.","Tuhin, ka naupa, LALPA chu i kuomah um a ta, inhlâwtlingtir a ti cheh a, nangma chungthua a hril ta angin, i Pathien LALPA in chu bâwl la."
"Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God.","LALPA chun hrietthiem theina le thlierthiem theina pe sienla che; Israel chunga thuneina pe raw se che; chuongchun, LALPA i Pathien dân chu i kawl zing theina dingin,"
"Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.","Israel chungthua LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk, rorêlna hai le dânhai chu thaw dinga i zâwm tlat chun hung hlawtling i tih; insukhrât la, insukhuoi la, beidawng naw la, ṭit khawm ṭi naw rawh."
"Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.","Tuhin ngai ta, ka theitâwk hu ang peiin, LALPA in ta ding chun rângkachak talent nuoi khat, tang- karuo talent maktaduoi khat, dârsen le thîr chu a bûk zât hriet lo ka buotsai tah a; chu ding chun, lung le thing khawm a tam tâwkin ka buotsai tah a nih; chu chu sunzawm thei i ta."
"Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work:","Chunawa khawm, i kuomah sinthawtuhai tam tâwk tak, lung suttuhai, a âttuhai, thing thaw mi, sin tinrênga themthiem mihai;"
"of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee.","rângkachak le, tangkaruo le, thîr le dârsena themthiemhai, nizât hriet sêng lo rau an na; tho la, thaw el rawh, LALPA chu i kuomah um a tih,” tiin."
"David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,",David chun Israel hotuhai po po chu a naupa Solomon chu ṭhangpui dingin thu a pêk bawk a;
"Is not Jehovah your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.","“LALPA in Pathien chu in kuomah a um a ni naw am a nih?

"Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehovah.","Tuhin, LALPA in Pathien chu zawng dingin in lungril le in lungvar chu ama tieng ngha unla, tho unla, chuongchun, LALPA Pathien hmun inthieng; LALPA thuthlungna bâwm le, Pathien bûr le bêl inthienghai chu hung lâkna dingin, LALPA hmingin in bâwl ro,” tiin."
Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.,"David chu a hung tar tah a, a hung upa ta hle a, a naupa Solomon chu Israel chunga lal dingin a siem tah a."
"And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.","Chun, Israel upahai po po le thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu a ko khâwm vawng a."
"And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.","Levi mihai chu kum sâwmthum chung tienga po chu tiem an na; an tiem dânbi ang chun an nizât chu, patling sîng thum le sâng riet an nih."
