"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;","Paula le Silvan le Timothe chun: Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Kristaa, Thessalonikaa kohranhai kuomah:"
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pa Pathien le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
"We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth;","Unauhai, nangni chungthua hin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu hril rawp ding hi kan ni hrim a; chu chu a âwm hrim a nih, in ringna chu nasataka inṭhang lienin, in rênga in inhmangai tuo sengna chu a pung nâwk zuol sih a."
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure;,"Chuongchun, suknawmnatna le rimsikna in tuornahai po poa in selna le in ringna hai lei khan, keini ngeiin Pathien kohranhai lai kan suong hlak cheu a nih."
"which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:","Chuong chu Pathien rama mi ni tlâka ruot in ni thei ding a nih ti Pathien rorêl feltak inchikna fietak a nih, chu ram leia chu tuor in ni hi."
"if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you,","Chuongchun, hi hi Pathien ta dingin thil feltak a nih: a sukrin- umtuhai cheu chu rinumnaa thung le;"
"and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,","nangni rinum tuortuhai chu, Lalpa Isu a vântirko hrâttakhai leh meichawk laia a hung inlang pha, keini le hin min châwltir le;"
"rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus:",Pathien hre naw mi le ei Lalpa Isu Chanchin Ṭha awi lo mihai chunga phuba lâk chu.
"who shall suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,",Chuong mihai chun hrem tuor an tih: Lalpa kuoma inthawk le a hrâtna ropuinaa inthawka chatuona bo- hmangna chu;
"when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.","chu ni, a mi inthienghaia chun chawimawia um ding le, ringtuhai po poa chun (kan thu inhriettir cheu kha in awi sih a) makti dinga a hung nia chun."
"To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfil every desire of goodness and every work of faith, with power;","Chuong anga chawimawi le makti a ni theina dingin, ei Pathienin a kona cheua chun ko tlâk nia a ruot theina ding cheu le, ṭhat nuomna tinrênga le ringna sinthaw tinrênga thilthawtheinaa ân hlawtlingtir theina ding cheuin kan ṭawngṭaipêk rawp cheu a ni hi."
"that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.","Chuongchun, ei Pathien le, ei Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna ang peiin ei Lalpa Isu hming chu nangnia chun chawimawiin um thei a ta, nangni khawm amaa chun chawi- mawiin um thei in tih."
"Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, ei Lalpa Isu Krista hungna le a kuoma ei hang inkhâwmna ding thua chun,"
"to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;","“Lalpa Ni chu a tlung zing tah,” tina thlarau leiin amanih, thu leiin amanih, kan kuoma inthawka lekha- thawn ang leiin amanih, in lungril inhnîng el nawna ding le in buoi bawk nawna dingin kan ngên cheu a nih."
"let no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,","Tûkhawmin iengkhawmin hlêm naw raw se cheu; tlûksanna chu a hung tlung hmasa zeta, Dân Bawsepa, bohmang naupa chu, a hung inlang naw chun, chu Ni chu tlung si naw nih a."
"he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.","Ama chu, Pathiena an inbûk taphawt le sakhuo po po doin an chunga um tumin inchawimawi a tih; chuongchun, Pathien biekina ṭhung- in Pathien ang rauin intâr suong a tih."
"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?",In kuoma ka hung um lai khan chuong thu chu ka hril hlak cheu ti in hriet zing naw am a nih?
"And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.",Ama hun tak chauah a hung inlang theina dingin iengin am a khapa ti tuhin in hriet.
"For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.","Dân bawsietna thurûk chun tu khawm hin sin a thaw zing a ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, a khaptu chun lâk hmanga a um hma poin khap a ta."
"And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming;","Lâk hmang a ni pha chun Dân Bawsepa chu hung inlang nghâl tâng a tih. Lalpa Isun ama chu a baua thuokin sukhlum a ta, a hunga inlârnain sukbohmang a tih."
"even he, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,","Chu Dân Bawsepa hungna chu Setan sinthaw zie ang peiin, thil- thawtheina tinrêng dâm, inchikna tinrêng dâm, khêl thilmak tinrêng leh,"
"and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.","bohmang zinghai dinga fel nawna hlêmna tinrêng leh nîng a tih, sandama an um theina dinga thutak hmangaina chu an pawm naw leiin."
"And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:","Chuleichun, thukhêl chu an awina dingin Pathienin suol sin- thawna chu an kuomah intlungtir a tih,"
"that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.","thutak awi loa, fel nawnaa lâwm lemtuhaiin thiemnaw an chang vawng theina dingin."
"But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:","Unau, Lalpa idittakhai, Thla- rau isukthiengnaa le thutak ring leia sandama um dingin a tîra inthawka Pathienin a thlang cheu leiin, in chungthua hin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu hril rawp ding hrim kan nih."
"whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Chuong anga ding chun ama chun kan Chanchin Ṭhaa hin a ko cheu kha, ei Lalpa Isu Krista ropuina nei dingin."
"So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.","Chuongchun, unauhai, ngîr det unla, thurosiehai chu, thu hrilin amanih, kan lekhathawnin amanih kan inchûktir cheu kha, pawm tlat ro."
"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,","Chuongchun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista ngei le, Pathien ei Pa, a mi hmangaitu le lunginsietna leia cha- tuona thlamuongna le beiseina ṭha mi petu chun,"
comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.,"in lungrilhai chu sukthla- muongin, thil thaw ṭha le thu hril ṭha tinrêngin sukdet raw se."
"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it is with you;","A tâwp taka chun,unauhai, kan ta dingin mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro; Lalpa thu hi nangni laia a um ang khan, hrâttaka indara chawimawia a um theina ding le,"
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.,mi kâwmaw le mi suolhai laia kan him theina dingin; mi po poin ringna an nei vawng si nawh a.
"But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil one.","Amiruokchu, Lalpa chu ring a um a, ama chun sukdetin mi suolhai lai chun hum a ti cheu."
"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.","Thu kan pêk taphawt cheu kha in zâwm hlak a, in la hung zâwm nâwk pei khawm Lalpaa chun kan ring cheu a nih."
"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.","Chun, Lalpa chun in lungril- hai chu Pathien hmangainaa le, Krista selnaa chun ṭhuoi lût raw se."
"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.","Chun, unauhai, kan kuoma inthawka thurosie an ihmu anga um loa, um ṭha nuom lo, unau tinrêng- haia inthawk chun insiekieng dingin, ei Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin thu kan pêk cheu."
For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;,"Nangni ngeiin in mîn chûk ding dân in hriet sih a, nangni lai dân naw angin kan châng naw kha."
"neither did we eat bread for nought at any man’s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:","Tu kuta inthawk khawma in bu a thlâwnin kan fak ngai bawk nawh a, nangni laia tukhawm kan sukkhâwk nawna ding cheuin, a sûn a zâna inrimtaka sin thaw pumin kan fâk lem a nih."
"not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.","Kan thei naw lei a ni nawh a, nangnîn in mîn chûkna dingin, in mi enkhi dingin kan insiem lem a nih."
"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.","In kuoma kan um lai khawm khan hi thu hi kan pêk cheu kha, “Tukhawmin sin a thaw nuom naw chun, fâk khawm fa naw raw se,” ti hi."
"For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.","Nangni laia ṭhenkhat um ṭha nuom ngailohai chanchin ka hriet sih a; chuonghai chun, sin hrim an thaw nawh a, an intawi mei mei lem a nih."
"Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.","Chuongchun, chuonghai chu, to zinga sin thaw ding le, anni bu ngei fa dingin Lalpa Isu Kristaa chun thu pein kan infui a nih."
"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.","Unauhai, nangni ruok chun thil ṭha thaw hi nghawk naw ro."
"And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.","Chun, tûkhawmin hi le- khathawna kan thu hi a zâwm naw chun, ama chu inchik unla, pâwl dêr naw ro, ân zak theina dingin."
"And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.","Nisienlakhawm, hmêlma ang chun ngai naw unla, unau angin kâwk lem ro. Lalpa chu in rênga kuomah um raw se."
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.,"Chun, inremna Lalpa ngei chun kumkhuoin kawng tinrêngah inrem- na pe raw se cheu."
"The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.","Kei Paulain, keima kut ngeia chibai ka bûkna cheu a ni hi, hi hi ka lekhathawn tina inchikna a nih; hieng anga ka ziek hi."
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.,Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lungin- sietna in rênga kuomah um raw se.
