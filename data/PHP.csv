"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:","Paula le Timothe, Krista Isu suokhai chun: Krista Isua mi inthieng Philippia um po pohai kuomah, kohran hotuhai le rawngbâwltuhai kuoma leh:"
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka hmangaina le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
"I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,","Ka hrietsuok po cheu leh ka Pathien kuomah lâwm thu ka hril hlak a,"
"always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,","nangni po po ka ṭawngṭaipêkna taphawt cheua chun hlimtakin ka hni hlak a nih,"
for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;,ni hmasataka inthawk khan tu chen hin Chanchin Ṭha puong darnaah in ṭhang ve zing leiin.
"being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:",Nangnia thilṭha thaw phuttu khan Isu Krista ni chen chun a thaw famkim pei ding a nih; chu ngei chu ka ring tlat sih a.
"even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.","Nangni po po tienga chuong ang lungril put chu keia ta ding chun a âwm hrim a nih, lungrila ka vawn cheu leiin; ka kawl bunnahai, Chanchin Ṭha thiemna thu ka hrilna le ka sukdetnahaia khawm in rêngin lunginsietna chu a mîn ṭâwmpui- tuhai in ni sih a."
"For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.","Krista Isu lainatna chun in rêngin ka ngaizie cheu chu, Pathien a mi hrepuitu a nih in sawnnaw."
"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;",In hmangaina chun hriet fam- kimna le bengvârna tinrêng a hau nâwk zuolna dingin ka ṭawngṭai hlak hi;
so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;,"Chuongchun, Krista nia chun inthieng le sawisêlbo in ni theina dingin, thil ṭha bîkhai chu ṭha ti thei in ta,"
"being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",Pathien ropuina le inpâkna ding Isu Krista zâra felna ra chun hung sip thei in tih.
"Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;","Unauhai, ka chunga thil hung tlunghai kha Chanchin Ṭha suk- darna ding a hung ni ta lem hlau ti in hriet ka nuom a nih."
"so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole prætorian guard, and to all the rest;","Chuongchun, ka kawl bunnahai hi Praitorian sipai pâwl po po lai le mi dang po po kuoma chun Krista lei a nih ti ân lang suok tah."
"and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.","Lalpaa unau tam lemhai khawm chun ka kawl bunnahai leia lo awi tlatin, ṭi loin Pathien thu hril kawngah an huoi nasa zuol a nih."
Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:,"Ṭhenkhat chun îtthîk le sêlna lei khawmin Krista thu an hril hlak, ṭhenkhat ruok chun lâwm leiin an hril bawk hlak:"
"the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;","pâwl khat chun, Chanchin Ṭha thiemna thu hril dinga ruot ka nih ti hrein lunginsiet leiin an hril hlak a nih,"
"but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.","pâwl dang ruok chun, ka kawl bun chunga hin lungngaina mi belsapêk tumin, titaktak ni loin, êsêlna leiin Krista thu an hril lem hlak."
"What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.","Iengtizie am a na? Ieng dang khawm a ni nawh a, kawng tin- rêngah, atehlêmin amanih, atakin amanih, Krista thu hrilin a um hrim hrim a nih, chuonga chun ka lâwm a, anih, la lâwm pei ka tih."
"For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,",Chu chu in mi ṭawngṭaipêkna lei le Isu Krista Thlarau a mi pêk leiin ka sandamna hung ning a tih ti ka hriet sih a.
"according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.","Ka beiseina le ka înhâwkna ang peiin ienga khawm sukmuolphoin um naw ningah a, huoitakin, ka um pângngai ang rawpin, tu khawm hin, hringna leiin amanih, thina leiin amanih, ka taksaa hin Krista chu chawimawiin a um ding a nih."
"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.","Ka ta ding chun hring hi Krista a ni sih a, thi khawm hlâwkna a nih."
"But if to live in the flesh,—if this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.","Nisienlakhawm, tisaa hring hi ka chan ni sienla, chu chu ka sinthaw ra ni ta ang sien, chuongchun, a ieng am ka thlang lem ding chu ka hriet nawh."
"But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:","Chamlakin a ngaina hre loin ka um el a nih, fe suoka Krista kuoma um inhâwkna ka nei leiin, chu chu a ṭha lem bêk bêk sih a."
yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.,"Nisienlakhawm, nangni leiin taksaa um zing hi a ṭûl lem a nih."
"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;","Chu chu ka ring tlat leiin um zing ka tih ti ka hriet a nih, ringnaa chun in hung inṭhang lienna ding le in lâwmna dingin in rênga kuomah um zing ka tih ti ka hriet;"
that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.,"chuongchun, in kuoma ka um nâwk ding leiin in mi suongna chu Krista Isua a nasat nâwkzuol theina dingin."
"Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;","Iengkhawm ni sienla, in um dân chu Krista Chanchin Ṭha leh inmawi phawt raw se. Chuongchun, nangni hung kan inla cheu khawm, in kuomah um naw lang khawm, thla- rau hmunkhata ngîr tlatin, lungril hmunkhata Chanchin Ṭha ringna thu ṭana thâtak sangin in um ti in chanchin lo hre thei ka tih."
"and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;","Ieng kawnga khawm dotuhai sukṭitin in um nawh a, chu chu anni ta ding chun bohmang ding an nih ti inhriettirna fietak a nih, nangni ta ding ruok chun sandam ding in nih ti inhriettirna fietak a ni lem a; chu khawm chu Pathiena inthawk a nih."
"because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:","Krista leia ama in ring chau ni loin, ama leia in tuor khawm phal a ni sih a,"
"having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.","indona keimaa in hmu hlak, tu khawm hin keimaa a um ti in ihriet, chu ngei chu in nei ve ta hi."
"If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,","Chuongchun, Kristaah lung- muongna hrim hrim dâm, hmangai thlamuongna hrim hrim dâm, Thlarau pâwlna hrim hrim dâm, lainatna le lunginsietna hrim hrim dâm a um chun,"
"make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;","lungril hmunkhata umin, hma- ngaina hmunkhat neiin, inthuruola lungril hmunkhata umin, ka lâwmna sukfamkim ro."
"doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;","Esêlna le inngaihlut leia ieng- khawm thaw loin, mi tinin inngai- tlâwmtakin mâni nêkin mi dang ṭha lemah ngai seng raw hai se."
"not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.","Mâni ta ta chau en loin, mi dang ta khawm en seng lem ro."
"Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:","Hi lungril, Krista Isu khawma um kha, nangniah um raw se."
"who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,","Ama chu Pathien nina neia um zing ni sien khawm, Pathien tluka um zing chu, tum lui tlat dingah a ngai nawh a,"
"but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;","mihriemhai anga hung insiengin, suok angin ân siem a, ama le ama ân suktlâwm ta lem a."
"and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.","Chun, mihriem anga hung umin ân ngaitlâwm a, thi khawp raka thu zâwmin a lo um tah a, krawsa thina ngei chu."
"Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;","Chuleichun, Pathienin ama chu nasatakin a chawimawi ve thung tah a, hming po poa hming chunghnung- tak chu a pêk tah a;"
"that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,","Isu hminga mi tin, vâna mihai, hnuoia mihai, hnuoi hnuoia mihai leh, an dingṭhaṭhuonna ding le,"
"and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.","Pa Pathien sukropuina dingin, “Isu Krista chu Lal a nih,” tia lei tinrêngin a puongna dingin."
"So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;","Chuongchun, ka idittakhai, thu in zâwm rawp ang khan, ka um lai chau ni loin, tûta ka um naw kâr hin nasa lem hmanin, ṭi le inthin pumin in sandamna thaw suok ro,"
"for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.",ama lâwmna dinga thaw tum ding le thaw dinga nangnia sin thawtu chu Pathien a ni sih a.
Do all things without murmurings and questionings:,"Chierna le insêlnahai um loin iengkim thaw ro,"
"that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,","suon rilo le kâwmawhai laiah, demkâilo le pawitâwklo, Pathien nau sawisêlbohai in ni theina dingin.Annirawi laia hringna thu in inhlan pha chun, khawvêla hin sukvartu dingin insuklang ro."
"holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.","Chuongchun, a thlâwna tlân ka ni nawh a, a thlâwna sininrim ka ni bawk naw leiin Krista nia chun suong ding nei thei ka tih."
"Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:","Anih, in ringna inthâwina le rawngbâwlna chunga chun bun- thlâka um ding ni lang khawm ka lâwm a nih, in rêngin ka lâwmpui bawk cheu a nih."
"and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.","Chuong ang bawkin nangni khawm lâwm unla, mi lâwmpui ve ro."
"But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.","Nisienlakhawm, in chanchin ka hrieta ka lungmuong ve theina dingin sâwt nawtê hnungah Timothe hi in kuoma hung tir Lalpa Isua chun ka beisei a nih."
"For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.","Hieng anga lungril put, in um- zie titakzeta ngaituopêktu ding cheu tûkhawm ka nei si nawh a."
"For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.","An rêngin Isu Krista thil zawng loin, mâni thil an zawng hlak sih a."
"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child serveth a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.","Nisienlakhawm, ama hi chu fiea a um tâkzie in hriet, nauin a pa rawng a bâwl angin, Chanchin Ṭha sukdar kawngah rawng a mi bâwlpui hlak kha."
"Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:","Chuongchun, ka chanchin ding ka hriet phingleh ama hi hung tir nghâl lang ka ti a nih."
but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.,"Nisienlakhawm, kei ngei khawm sâwt nawtê hnungah hung Lalpaa chun kân ring tlat a nih."
"But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;","Nisienlakhawm, Epaphrodita, ka unaupa, ka sinthawpui, ka sipai- pui le in tirko, ka thil tlâksama mi sawmdâwltu hi in kuoma hung tir ṭulin ka hriet."
"since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:","Ama chun in rêngin a ngai bêk bêk cheu a, a nâ ti in lo hriet leiin nasatakin a lungngai bawk a,"
"for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.","thi ngama nâ chu a ni ngei luoh a. Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ama chu a lunginsiet a; chun, ama chau khawm ni loin, lungngaina chunga lungngai nâwkzuolna ka nei nawna dingin kei a mi lunginsiet a ni fâwm bawk a."
"I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.","Chuongchun, ama hi in hmu nâwk phaa in lâwm theina ding le, kei ka lungngai a ṭhathnem theina dingin ka hung tir inhmaw deu a nih."
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:,"Chuongchun, ama hi hlimna tinrêngin Lalpaah lo lâwm unla, hieng ang mi hi ngaihlu ro."
"because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.","In mi sawmdâwlna tlin bâk chu sunzawmna dingin thi dâwn loa thâtak suoin, Krista sinthawna leiin thi vângin a lo um ta sih a."
"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.","A tâwp taka chun, unauhai, Lalpaa chun lâwm ro. Thu pângngai in kuoma ziek rawp hi keia ta ding chun nghawkum a ni nawh, nangni ta dingin a ṭhahnem bawk sih a."
"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:","Uihai laia chun fîmkhur ro, thil ṭha naw thawtuhai laia chun fîmkhur ro, mâni taksa sukrimsi hlakhai laia chun fîmkhur ro."
"for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:","Eini Pathien Thlarau zâra Pa- thien bie le, Krista Isu suong le, taksa chunga ringna innghat nawhai hi, Sertanhai ei ni lem sih a."
"though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:","Nuom lang lem chu kei khawm tisa chunga ringna innghat thei ka nih in sawnnaw. Mi dang hrim hrimin tisa chunga ringna innghatna neia an inngai chun, kei kân ngai nâwk zuol a nih."
"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;","Ni riet nia sertan, Israel suona mi, Benjamin chia mi, Hebrai kâra Hebraia insieng ka nih; dân tienga chu Pharisai ka nih,"
"as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.",ṭhahnemngai tienga chun ko- hranhai suknawmnatu ka nih; Dân thua felna tienga chun sawisêlbo ka nih.
"Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ta dinga hlâwkna ding po po chu, chuong chu Krista leiin chânnaah ka ngai a nih:"
"Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,","A ni takzet el, ka Lalpa Isu Krista hrietna ropui bîk leiin, thil tinrêng khawm chânnaah ka ngai a nih; ama lei chun thil po po ka chân ta vawng a, chuongchu hnephnâwl ang chauah ka ngai a nih."
"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:","Hi lei hin a nih: Amaa ka um theina ding le, mâni felna (Dâna felna) ringawt nei loa, Krista ringna leia felna, (ringna leia Pathiena inthawka felna) chu nei lemin;"
"that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;","Krista le a thonâwkna thil- thawtheina chu ka hriet chieng theina ding le a tuornahai inṭawm- puia, a thinaa ama ang ka hung ni theina dingin;"
if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.,mi thi laia inthawka thonâwkna chu ka chang thei duoiin tiin.
"Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.","Hmu ta zing inti ka ni nawh a, famkim ta zing inti khawm ka ni bawk nawh, “Krista mi manna san chu ka man thei duoiin,” tiin a hnawtin ka hnawt lem a nih. Unauhai, manah ka lân ngai nawh."
"Brethren, I count not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,","Amiruokchu, hi thil pakhat hi ka thaw hlak–Hnungtienga thil umhai chu theinghila hmatienga thil umhai chu banin,"
I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.,"Krista Isua Pathien chungtieng kona san lâwmman hmu dingin, tiem chin tieng chu ka pan ṭâl ṭâl a nih."
"Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:","Chuongchun, puitling taphawt chu chuong ang lungril putin um ei tiu; chun, ieng kawnga khawm lungril danglam put in lo ni chun, chu khawm chu Pathienin lân hriettir a ti cheu."
"only, whereunto we have attained, by that same rule let us walk.","Iengkhawm ni sien la, ei phâk chin ang pei hi sukdikin, chutaka inthawk chun fe pei ei tiu."
"Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.","Unauhai, ka um dân inchûk- tuhai lo ni tâwl ro; chun, enkhi ding keini in mi nei a, chuong ang peia umhai chu en ṭha ro."
"For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:","Mi tamtak an feh a, chuhai chu Krista kraws hmêlma an ni ti an chanchin ka hril rawp cheu kha, tu khawm hin ṭap pumin ka hril cheu hi."
"whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.","Chuonghai tâwpna chu bo- hmangna a nih, an Pathien chu an phîng a nih, an ropuina khawm chu an muolphona a nih, khawvêl thil an dit hlak a nih."
"For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:",Eini chu vân khuoletuihai ei ni sih a. Sandamtu Lal Isu Krista hung ding chu ei nghâk zing a nih.
"who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.","Ama chun a sinthawin iengkim khawm ama thu thuin ân umtir thei, chu thawzie ang pei chun ei tlâwmlai taksa hi, ama taksa ropui anga um dingin siem ṭha nâwk a tih."
"Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.","Chuleiin, ka unau dittak le ka ngaitak, ka lâwmna le ka lallukhumhai, chuong ang chun Lalpaah ngîr det ro, ka dittakhai."
"I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.","Lalpaa chun lungril hmunkhat put dingin Eodi ka ngên a, Suntuki khawm ka ngên bawk a nih."
"Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.","Anih, nang khawm ka rîngkawl bâtpui tak, ka fiel bawk che, kha nuhmeihai kha ṭhangpui rawh. Chanchin Ṭhaa chun an mi thawpui hlak sih a; Klemen le ka sinthawpui dang Hringna bua hming chuonghai le khan."
"Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.","Lalpaa chun lâwm rawp ro, ti nâwk hlak ka tih lâwm ro. In zaidawtheizie mi po po hriet ni raw se."
Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.,"Lalpa chu a hnai a, ienga khawm lunginzing naw ro."
In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.,Iengkimah ṭawngṭai le hniin lâwmthu hrilsa peiin in dithai chu Pathien kuomah inhriettirin um lem raw se.
"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.","Chuongchun, Pathien thlamuon- na, lungril hrim hrima hriet sênglo khan, in lungril le in ngaituonahai chu Krista Isua chun vêngpêk a ti cheu."
"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.","A tâwp taka chun, unauhai, ân dik taphawt dâm, ân zâum taphawt dâm, a fel taphawt dâm, ân thieng taphawt dâm, a ditum taphawt dâm, ân thang mawi taphawt dâm, ṭhatna hrim hrim a um a, inpâkna hrim hrim a um chun, chuong chu ngaituo ro."
"The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.","Keimaa thil in inchûka in pawmhai dâm, in hmua in hriethai dâm, khâng thil kha thaw hlak ro. Chuongchun, Lungmuongna Pathien chun umpui a ti cheu."
"But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ta dinga in ngaituona chu tûta in hung thâwthar nâwk ta leiin, Lalpaa chun ka lâwm hle a nih; chuong ang kawng chu ngaituo kha chu in ngaituo hleh a, remchâng ruok chu in hmu naw mei a ni kha."
"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.","Ka tlâksamna thu hril chu ka ni nawh a, a kei chu ieng ang khawmin um lang lungawi pei ka chîng ta sih a."
"I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.","Tlâwmtaka um dân ka thiem a, hausaa um dân khawm ka thiem bawk a, thil tinrêng le thil po poa tlai le phîngṭama um dân, hausa le tlasama um dân thurûk chu ka hriet suok tah."
I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.,A mi sukhrâttu Krista zâra chun iengkim ka thaw thei a nih.
Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka lunginzîng- naa in mi lo lunginzîngpui hi in thaw ṭha ngawt el."
"And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;","Chun, nangni Philippia mihai, Chanchin Ṭha tlung hlim laia Makedonia rama inthawka ka fe suok lai khan, nangni chau naw chun, ko- hran pakhat khawmin thil, pêk le dawng kawngah an mi ṭhangpui nawh ti nangni ngeiin in hriet bawk a."
for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.,"Thessalonikaa ka um lai khawm khan, ka tlâksamna phuhrûk dingin vawi khat chau ni loin, vawi hni lai in hung inphur kha,"
Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.,"Thilpêk chu zawng ka ni nawh a, ra nangni tienga pung ding chu zawng ka ni lem."
"But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.","Nisienlakhawm, iengkim ka nei a, ka hau a nih: Epaphrodita kuta in iengkhat hung inphurhai kha ka lo hmu a, ka phuiinsui tah. Chuongchu thil riminhnik rim, inthâwina dawn tlâk, Pathien lâwm zâwng a nih."
And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.,"Chun, ka Pathien chun Krista Isua a ropuina hauzie ang peiin, in tlâksamna tinrêng khawm phuhrûk- pêk a ti cheu."
Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.,Ei Pathien le ei Pa kuoma chun kumkhuoin ropuina chu um raw se. Amen.
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.,Krista Isua mi inthieng tinrêng chibai mi bûkpêk ro. Ka kuoma unau umhai hin chibai an bûk cheu a.
"All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Cæsar’s household.",Mi inthieng po poin chibai an bûk cheu a; abîktakin Kaisar sûnghai laia mihai hin an bûk cheu a nih.
